In other words, it seeks to create a model that represents the system under consideration. A critical question for the practical use of models is whether the model itself and the results obtained from it can be trusted. A deeper understanding of models and the development of methods for model assessment were central topics of the DFG Research Training Group GRK 1462 \"Evaluation of coupled numerical and experimental partial models in structural engineering\" [2], where I began my scientific career.

Moreover, while the practical use of such a wrong model might still be correct from the algorithmic perspective, the results it produces are meaningless.

This perspective necessitates a formal mathematical description of models. Among different possibilities, category theory was chosen as the mathematical foundation for this work. For a long time after its introduction by S. Eilenberg and S. Mac Lane in [3], category theory was often referred to by its nickname \"abstract nonsense\" to emphasise that this theory has no practical applications. However, it is now safe to say that category theory has evolved from a theory with only few applications in algebraic topology to the theory with applications in various fields of science and technology.

This chapter establishes a general context for the rest of this book. We start with a general discussion on models and modelling process within the engineering context. We then discuss the model consistency and the modelling errors that may arise during the modelling process. Specifically, we emphasise that it is necessary to distinguish between the conceptual modelling errors, which appear because of violating basic modelling assumptions, and the instance modelling errors, which are related to the practical implementation of models. After that, we provide a brief overview of the conceptual modelling approaches, which could help us to evaluate models with respect to their coherence, as well as provide possibilities for a more formal description of the model creation process.","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"page_idx":11,"id":"6bd2c5fb-fb29-4692-8cda-0939621c3a66","page_size":[439,666],"block_position":"11-2"},{"bbox":[51,336,237,349],"type":"title","angle":0,"index":3,"text":"# 1.1 Models and Modelling Process","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"level":1,"page_idx":11,"id":"dd5ade5f-ba66-479a-a87e-bcdb916ad620","page_size":[439,666],"block_position":"11-3"},{"bbox":[50,365,386,437],"type":"text","angle":0,"index":4,"text":"The understanding of models and, especially, mathematical models, is the main objective of this book, and several perspective on models will be provided in the upcoming chapters.

The ultimate goal of the modelling process, however, is not merely create the model but to analyse it and draw conclusions about the engineering system. Looking more generally at the modelling process, it is safe to assume that the final objective of the modelling process is to describe a certain real-world phenomenon. Hence, independent of the model type, a model is required to describe this real-world phenomenon, or, in other words, approximate the reality [4, 46]. However, before creating a model, it is essential to clearly formulate a modelling task that includes parameters and effects the model must encompass. In this regard, the output of the modelling process—the final model—must be evaluated with respect to the modelling task formulated in the beginning. This model evaluation aims at assessing model quality, or, in other words, to \"measure\" how adequate the model represents the physical phenomenon under consideration. Figure 1.1 schematically illustrates a general framework of the modelling process, indicating that the model quality assessment requires not only the final result (the model itself), but also the initial modelling task; otherwise, criteria for assessing the model would be undefined.","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"page_idx":12,"id":"29340b22-fd15-48b1-9a2e-f86200bcb025","page_size":[439,666],"block_position":"12-7"},{"bbox":[51,510,386,558],"type":"text","angle":0,"index":10,"text":"A distinct feature of modern engineering problems is that because of their growing complexity, conventional simplified single-model approaches for engineering problems are increasingly substituted by combinations of coupled models.

Nonetheless, in the field of modelling of dynamical systems, predicate logic and metalanguages have shown their usefulness, see [43-45] and references therein. In these works, it has been shown that system models can be turned into logical equations, resulting in the fact that many important properties of these models can be proved by studying the corresponding logical equations. In this book, we will not use model theory and predicate logic to address the conceptual modelling phase. Instead, we will work with similar formal theories, such as type theory [35] and lambda calculus [5], in Chap. 5, where these theories are utilised to detect conceptual modelling errors in practice.

Moreover, the kinds of equations supported are limited, such as differential-algebraic equations in the case of Modelica with some limited extensions to partial differential equations [37], which are numerically treated.

In the context of this book, the use of type theory is particularly important. In the context of modelling languages it means, that the type system of a modelling language must be appropriately designed: by static checking of model derivation, it can be ensured that the conceptual modelling has been carried out such that the resulting multiphysics model does not contradict basic physical laws and assumptions before preparing simulation code. Originating from the Functional Reactive Programming [29], Functional Hybrid Modelling (FHM) [10, 30] is a first step in the development of a Haskell-based modelling language with a robust type system allowing us to detect modelling errors more effectively compared to the type systems in the traditional modelling languages. In essence, FHM enriches Haskell with a notion of first-class equations for modelling of physical systems. Haskell provides the required abstraction mechanisms and means for constructing systems by composing equation system fragments. While, in terms of language design and modelling aims, FHM is similar to Modelica and thus suffers the same limitations, the design of FHM can serve as a blueprint for a language for modelling systems in the abstract, demonstrating the usefulness of Haskell for this kind of modelling language research and design.

After that, this chapter presents categorical ontology logs, or simply ologs, which combine flexibility of classical all-purpose ontologies and mathematical rigorosity of category theory. Finally, we discuss some classical and more recent applications of category theory focusing in particular on applications related to conceptual modelling.","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"page_idx":32,"id":"c2143f28-4397-42d5-bdd6-ba79d3ef599c","page_size":[439,666],"block_position":"32-2"},{"bbox":[52,336,215,349],"type":"title","angle":0,"index":3,"text":"# 2.1 Basics of Category Theory","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"level":1,"page_idx":32,"id":"9965bda5-e26a-4d8c-badb-79137f9ce3e8","page_size":[439,666],"block_position":"32-3"},{"bbox":[52,364,386,462],"type":"text","angle":0,"index":4,"text":"Category theory was introduced in 1945 by S.

In general words, category theory provides a language which helps to describe properties of different objects by using their representation with diagrams of arrows. In this case, each arrow represents a function (mapping) between two objects.

With this idea in mind, the logic has been analysed from the categorical point of view.

At first, a categorical description of mathematical models is introduced, and their properties are discussed. After that, coupled models are addressed by lifting the results from categories of mathematical models to the categories of coupled models. However, because of the coupling, the structure of categories of coupled models is more complicated. In particular, it is necessary to distinguish if models from the same or from different categories are coupled. Finally, more abstract categorical constructions on categories of mathematical models are discussed. For supporting the reader, the chapter is provided with various illustrative examples for practical interpretations of the abstract constructions introduced in this chapter.","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"page_idx":49,"id":"b0d693d7-5e17-4f00-b867-a2adda24a5d0","page_size":[439,666],"block_position":"49-2"},{"bbox":[52,359,191,372],"type":"title","angle":0,"index":3,"text":"# 3.1 Preliminary Remarks","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"level":1,"page_idx":49,"id":"ab08d64c-7547-4bad-9d81-a209cd01b7ef","page_size":[439,666],"block_position":"49-3"},{"bbox":[52,389,386,581],"type":"text","angle":0,"index":4,"text":"As discussed in Chap. 1, the complexity of modern engineering problems necessitates the use of advanced coupled models constructed as a combination of partial models describing each individual phenomenon needed to be addressed by the global model. The category theory-based modelling framework presented in this chapter aims to provide a consistent description of models and their couplings in the language of category theory. Abstract categorical descriptions require first the definition of universal properties of models—properties which are shared by models in general and are independent on any specific problem or engineering field. If a universal model property is defined, then all categorical constructions used in one specific modelling application can be directly transferred to another field. Thus, the category theory-based modelling framework begins with defining such a universal model property which is common across all models.

As demonstrated by this example, the basic equations remain identical, and the only difference comes from the presence of cracks. Similarly, it is also not sufficient to look only at boundary conditions. For instance, a typical boundary condition for crack faces, which are a part of the boundary, is the traction-free condition implying that normal stresses are zero on crack surfaces. However, zero normal stresses boundary condition on parts of a boundary are a typical condition in many boundary value problems. Therefore, for distinguishing different mathematical models, it is absolutely necessary to analyse the basic modelling assumptions, and not only the final form of equations.","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"page_idx":75,"id":"f692ce0a-7fd9-4d13-9d48-6e204e6e35cb","page_size":[439,666],"block_position":"75-1"},{"bbox":[50,209,386,305],"type":"text","angle":0,"index":3,"text":"To finish our discussion on the category Elast, let us recall that several formulations of elasticity models, namely the Lamé equation and quaternionic formulations, have been mentioned already at the beginning of this chapter.

In this way, all constructions introduced for categories of mathematical models in Sect. 3.2 can also be preserved and applied at the level of coupled mathematical models.

The goal here is to grasp the essential ideas of these constructions in simpler formulations motivated by the engineering perspective. These formulations remain accurate, but are free of too many formal constructions. Consequently, the practical applicability of the category theory-based modelling framework proposed in this book will be increased. After that, we discuss some further model properties, such as for example model uncertainty and model robustness, and evaluate them with respect to their potential for formalisation within the category theory-based modelling framework. Additionally, we explore a more abstract perspective on model comparison and model evaluation. Finally, the chapter concludes with an application of the category theory-based modelling framework to practical problems of bridge aerodynamics and a discussion of how the categorical modelling perspective can support the development of solution methods for coupled problems in practice.","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"page_idx":121,"id":"e31a9633-b5b3-4232-bda6-f3967094d150","page_size":[439,666],"block_position":"121-2"},{"bbox":[50,396,359,410],"type":"title","angle":0,"index":3,"text":"# 4.1 Engineering Perspective on Categorical Constructions","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"level":1,"page_idx":121,"id":"a64fc893-1087-43e8-81d9-fa82247716e8","page_size":[439,666],"block_position":"121-3"},{"bbox":[50,425,386,544],"type":"text","angle":0,"index":4,"text":"The aim of this section is to enhance the practical applications of the category theory-based modelling framework by providing simpler analogues of the key categorical constructions introduced in Chap. 3.

In contrast, the model complexity, as introduced in Definition 3.2 and revisit in Definition 4.2, addresses this \"distance\" at the level of modelling assumptions. For example, if we are interested in the modelling of a non-linear phenomenon, but we choose a linear model, then it is evident from the beginning, that the model fidelity cannot be high in this case. Thus, model complexity provides a general setting for the range of applications for a given model.

This chapter begins with a presentation of ideas for automatic model generation. The key concept is to analyse the formalisation mappings that appear in categories of mathematical models from a computer science perspective. These ideas naturally lead to the application of type theory to mathematical modelling. In this concept, mathematical models are formalised by types, and the type system of a functional programming language can be utilised to verify the consistency of model derivation. A general algorithm for such verification is presented in this chapter. Finally, a relational algebra-based approach to abstract description of models is proposed. While this approach lacks some strictness of the category theory-based modelling framework, it compensates with enhanced flexibility in working with models and relations between them. Moreover, even models of physical objects, which are not necessary described in terms of mathematical expressions and equations, can also be addressed by this approach.","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"page_idx":149,"id":"a1bf9674-1582-4109-ae62-f107efbef902","page_size":[439,666],"block_position":"149-2"},{"bbox":[51,396,307,408],"type":"title","angle":0,"index":3,"text":"# 5.1 Ideas Towards Automatic Model Generation","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"level":1,"page_idx":149,"id":"d43a4cfb-58f4-4591-a52e-2523be7fc3cf","page_size":[439,666],"block_position":"149-3"},{"bbox":[52,425,385,520],"type":"text","angle":0,"index":4,"text":"The goal of this section is to initiate a discussion on automatic model generation.
