In other words, it seeks to create a model that represents the system under consideration. A critical question for the practical use of models is whether the model itself and the results obtained from it can be trusted. A deeper understanding of models and the development of methods for model assessment were central topics of the DFG Research Training Group GRK 1462 \"Evaluation of coupled numerical and experimental partial models in structural engineering\" [2], where I began my scientific career. It was quickly recognised that most existing model assessment approaches focus primarily on the practical aspects of models, in other words, they address the correctness of model implementation.",

Consequently, the overall model assessment must also address these modelling assumptions and their formalisation. Errors arising from the violation of modelling assumptions are particularly significant because they make the model conceptually wrong. Moreover, while the practical use of such a wrong model might still be correct from the algorithmic perspective, the results it produces are meaningless. Consequently, addressing conceptual modelling errors requires a deeper understanding of the model creation process, particularly in the case of coupled problems where multiple models need to be coupled.",

Mac Lane in [3], category theory was often referred to by its nickname \"abstract nonsense\" to emphasise that this theory has no practical applications. However, it is now safe to say that category theory has evolved from a theory with only few applications in algebraic topology to the theory with applications in various fields of science and technology.

After discussing individual mathematical models, the framework addresses the coupling of models, demonstrating that the categorical structure for coupled mathematical models is more complicated.

This discussion leads to the classification of model properties into universal model properties and applied model properties.

We then discuss the model consistency and the modelling errors that may arise during the modelling process. Specifically, we emphasise that it is necessary to distinguish between the conceptual modelling errors, which appear because of violating basic modelling assumptions, and the instance modelling errors, which are related to the practical implementation of models. After that, we provide a brief overview of the conceptual modelling approaches, which could help us to evaluate models with respect to their coherence, as well as provide possibilities for a more formal description of the model creation process.",

The ultimate goal of the modelling process, however, is not merely create the model but to analyse it and draw conclusions about the engineering system. Looking more generally at the modelling process, it is safe to assume that the final objective of the modelling process is to describe a certain real-world phenomenon. Hence, independent of the model type, a model is required to describe this real-world phenomenon, or, in other words, approximate the reality [4, 46]. However, before creating a model, it is essential to clearly formulate a modelling task that includes parameters and effects the model must encompass. In this regard, the output of the modelling process—the final model—must be evaluated with respect to the modelling task formulated in the beginning. This model evaluation aims at assessing model quality, or, in other words, to \"measure\" how adequate the model represents the physical phenomenon under consideration. Figure 1.1 schematically illustrates a general framework of the modelling process, indicating that the model quality assessment requires not only the final result (the model itself), but also the initial modelling task; otherwise, criteria for assessing the model would be undefined.",

However, if we are interested in modelling of only a single beam, then the global model would consist of only one partial model in this case. In this context, the primary difference between global model and a coupled model is that a \"global model\" represents a complete model of a real object, whereas a coupled model may be an incomplete model that combines several partial models.

Additionally, with the growing complexity of engineering problems nowadays, the number of critical points that can lead to conceptual modelling errors, as discussed above, also increases. Because conceptual modelling errors appear on the early stage in the modelling process, their impact on the quality of the final result is much more profound. Moreover, as it has been indicated by the examples, conceptual modelling errors do not necessarily make the model formulation wrong (differential equation in the examples), but rather make the results of computations with this model formulation meaningless. Because of that reason, detection of conceptual modelling errors is much more complicated. In particular, it is not possible to look only at the final model formulations for detecting such errors, but rather necessary to understand how the model creation process works and what assumptions have been used, and if they can be alternated without violating the model correctness.",

However, the application of model theory and the lower predicate calculus typically requires extensive formal constructions, making it less applicable in practice, particularly for models described by partial differential equations. Nonetheless, in the field of modelling of dynamical systems, predicate logic and metalanguages have shown their usefulness, see [43-45] and references therein. In these works, it has been shown that system models can be turned into logical equations, resulting in the fact that many important properties of these models can be proved by studying the corresponding logical equations. In this book, we will not use model theory and predicate logic to address the conceptual modelling phase. Instead, we will work with similar formal theories, such as type theory [35] and lambda calculus [5], in Chap. 5, where these theories are utilised to detect conceptual modelling errors in practice. Furthermore, considering that there is a connection between logic and type theory, then it is possible to see that the type theory-based approach is a kind of alternative to [43-45], and that perhaps there is a way to utilise advantages of both by connecting them.",

Common conceptual modelling languages include, for example, the Entity-Relationship model, the Enhanced Entity-Relationship model, Unified Modeling Language class diagrams, Object-Role Modeling (ORM), and Second Generation ORM [20].

Consequently, many aspects of such languages are geared towards supporting that goal, meaning that models often become less abstract and more operational than they could be. Moreover, the kinds of equations supported are limited, such as differential-algebraic equations in the case of Modelica with some limited extensions to partial differential equations [37], which are numerically treated.

Several attempts in this direction have been presented in recent years: see for example works [26] and [6] for applications in the fields of cyber-system modelling and Unified Modelling Language, respectively. In the context of this book, the use of type theory is particularly important. In the context of modelling languages it means, that the type system of a modelling language must be appropriately designed: by static checking of model derivation, it can be ensured that the conceptual modelling has been carried out such that the resulting multiphysics model does not contradict basic physical laws and assumptions before preparing simulation code. Originating from the Functional Reactive Programming [29], Functional Hybrid Modelling (FHM) [10, 30] is a first step in the development of a Haskell-based modelling language with a robust type system allowing us to detect modelling errors more effectively compared to the type systems in the traditional modelling languages. In essence, FHM enriches Haskell with a notion of first-class equations for modelling of physical systems. Haskell provides the required abstraction mechanisms and means for constructing systems by composing equation system fragments. While, in terms of language design and modelling aims, FHM is similar to Modelica and thus suffers the same limitations, the design of FHM can serve as a blueprint for a language for modelling systems in the abstract, demonstrating the usefulness of Haskell for this kind of modelling language research and design. First steps in extension of the FHM to realistic models appearing in engineering will be presented in Chap. 5.",

Next, lattice of theories concept is also important for some parts of this book, therefore it will be introduced in this chapter as well. After that, this chapter presents categorical ontology logs, or simply ologs, which combine flexibility of classical all-purpose ontologies and mathematical rigorosity of category theory. Finally, we discuss some classical and more recent applications of category theory focusing in particular on applications related to conceptual modelling.",

In this area of applications, category theory is used as a formal theory to describe programming languages and, as the result, to reason about programs.

Because some results presented in this book were inspired by the connection of category theory and functional programming, let us now recall some more concrete examples from [3] of using category theory in this context:",

At first, a categorical description of mathematical models is introduced, and their properties are discussed. After that, coupled models are addressed by lifting the results from categories of mathematical models to the categories of coupled models. However, because of the coupling, the structure of categories of coupled models is more complicated. In particular, it is necessary to distinguish if models from the same or from different categories are coupled. Finally, more abstract categorical constructions on categories of mathematical models are discussed. For supporting the reader, the chapter is provided with various illustrative examples for practical interpretations of the abstract constructions introduced in this chapter.",

The category theory-based modelling framework presented in this chapter aims to provide a consistent description of models and their couplings in the language of category theory. Abstract categorical descriptions require first the definition of universal properties of models—properties which are shared by models in general and are independent on any specific problem or engineering field. If a universal model property is defined, then all categorical constructions used in one specific modelling application can be directly transferred to another field. Thus, the category theory-based modelling framework begins with defining such a universal model property which is common across all models. Furthermore, the main goal is also to ensure that the constructions introduced in the framework retain meaningful physical and engineering interpretations, bridging the abstract theory with practical applications. Hence, we will provide illustrative examples alongside the abstract categorical constructions.",

Note that, although categories of mathematical models have finite sets as objects, the initial and terminal objects are different to the ones in the classical category Sets, where these are given by the empty set and one-element set, correspondingly. The difference comes precisely from the modelling background of our categories, since while formally it is still possible to consider the empty and one-element sets as sets of assumptions of some (fictitious) models, it does not make sense from the modelling perspective.",

Furthermore, the example of objects  $\\mathbf{Set}_{\\mathrm{LE}}$  and  $\\mathbf{Set}_{\\mathrm{LEF}}$  indicates once more that it is not sufficient to look only at the final model formulations, such as differential equations. As demonstrated by this example, the basic equations remain identical, and the only difference comes from the presence of cracks. Similarly, it is also not sufficient to look only at boundary conditions. For instance, a typical boundary condition for crack faces, which are a part of the boundary, is the traction-free condition implying that normal stresses are zero on crack surfaces. However, zero normal stresses boundary condition on parts of a boundary are a typical condition in many boundary value problems. Therefore, for distinguishing different mathematical models, it is absolutely necessary to analyse the basic modelling assumptions, and not only the final form of equations.",

Consequently, it becomes necessary to extend the categorical perspective on mathematical models presented in previous sections to encompass coupled mathematical models. The idea behind this extension is to preserve the general framework established for categories of individual mathematical models, and elevate it to the level of coupled models. In this way, all constructions introduced for categories of mathematical models in Sect. 3.2 can also be preserved and applied at the level of coupled mathematical models. However, because of a more complicated structure of coupled models, the notions of model complexity and convertibility will also become more technical, as we will see throughout the upcoming sections.",

Nonetheless, the construction of sets of assumptions of coupled models by using functors does not exclude this situation, because modification of objects  $\\mathbf{Set}_i$ ,  $\\mathbf{Set}_j$  by functors implies adding something more to the both objects.

The goal here is to grasp the essential ideas of these constructions in simpler formulations motivated by the engineering perspective. These formulations remain accurate, but are free of too many formal constructions. Consequently, the practical applicability of the category theory-based modelling framework proposed in this book will be increased. After that, we discuss some further model properties, such as for example model uncertainty and model robustness, and evaluate them with respect to their potential for formalisation within the category theory-based modelling framework. Additionally, we explore a more abstract perspective on model comparison and model evaluation. Finally, the chapter concludes with an application of the category theory-based modelling framework to practical problems of bridge aerodynamics and a discussion of how the categorical modelling perspective can support the development of solution methods for coupled problems in practice.",

The fidelity itself can be seen as the distance between a model and the system it represents [6]. The term \"distance\" suggests that there exists a way to quantify the difference between the model and reality. In contrast, the model complexity, as introduced in Definition 3.2 and revisit in Definition 4.2, addresses this \"distance\" at the level of modelling assumptions. For example, if we are interested in the modelling of a non-linear phenomenon, but we choose a linear model, then it is evident from the beginning, that the model fidelity cannot be high in this case. Thus, model complexity provides a general setting for the range of applications for a given model. However, it is still possible to quantify the influence of specific modelling assumptions on the fidelity of the resulting model. We will introduce more formal definitions for such quantifications in Sect. 4.2 and present a practical engineering example in Sect. 4.3.",

This is exactly the ground where the model complexity starts to be confused with computational complexity or the overall complexity of a solution procedure.

In fact, the framework provides a certain level of flexibility: the modeller can decide which approach best suits their current needs—describe sets of assumptions in a natural language, or consider their formalised versions. At the same time, all possible constructions remain mathematically sound, and there is always a clear way how to switch between the two options.",

By analysing the sets of assumptions of the models QS and LQS, it can be observed that the principal difference lies in the linearisation. Consequently, we can study the effect of nonlinearity, based on the set of assumptions SetQS, for which  $M_{rms}^{\\mathrm{QS,LQS}}$  is shown in Fig. 4.6 (left).

However, the difference for the rotation for  $U > 40~\\mathrm{m / s}$  increases, which is attributed to the effect of fluid memory on the aerodynamic coupling [14].

The categorical perspective provides a structured way to \"tracking\" the coupling conditions from the conceptual level to practical implementation.

This chapter begins with a presentation of ideas for automatic model generation. The key concept is to analyse the formalisation mappings that appear in categories of mathematical models from a computer science perspective. These ideas naturally lead to the application of type theory to mathematical modelling. In this concept, mathematical models are formalised by types, and the type system of a functional programming language can be utilised to verify the consistency of model derivation. A general algorithm for such verification is presented in this chapter. Finally, a relational algebra-based approach to abstract description of models is proposed. While this approach lacks some strictness of the category theory-based modelling framework, it compensates with enhanced flexibility in working with models and relations between them. Moreover, even models of physical objects, which are not necessary described in terms of mathematical expressions and equations, can also be addressed by this approach.",

Since no formal relations between these models have been introduced yet, there are several possibilities for creating a lattice of these models. Figure 5.1 presents the lattice of mathematical models with expansions and analogy operations being used on the lattice. As it can be clearly observed, this figure represents a kind of blending between the diagrams depicting the structures of the categories  $\\mathbf{Beam}$  and  $\\mathbf{Beam}^{F}$ . Furthermore, in constructing this lattice of mathematical models, we have implicitly adapted the idea of relating models by comparing their sets of assumptions, as described through the concept of complexity in Definition 3.2. In this context, the expansion operation is understood as expanding the range of physical effects and phenomena describable by a model, while the analogy operation is understood as a reformulation of the model formulation  $C$  into  $\\mathcal{D}$ .",

Along this path, the notion of a consistently formalisable set of assumptions has been proposed. The critical point here is the theoretical existence of a verification algorithm allowing checking the derivation of a model from its underlying set of assumptions. This problem can be seen as analogous to the decidability problem in logic or the decision problem in computer science. Thus, the ideas on automatic model generation open potential directions for future research at the intersection of mathematics and theoretical computer science.",

In particular, mathematical models are based on modelling assumptions, which can be violated even before computing with the model. Thus, it is necessary to distinguish between conceptual modelling errors, related to breaking basic modelling assumptions, and modelling errors related to practical realisation of models, such as the quality of computer implementation and approximation quality. While the errors related to practical realisation of models are well-understood and studied, the conceptual modelling errors are much more difficult to address, because a deep understanding of the model creation process is required.",

Using this two-phase modelling methodology, it was clearly demonstrated that conceptual modelling and conceptual modelling errors significantly impact the quality of the modelling process outcomes.
