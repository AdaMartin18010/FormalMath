Thus, applications of computer science to mathematical logic, as well as applications of mathematical logic to computer science, will yield many topics of interest. Among other areas, it will cover combinations of logical reasoning and machine learning as applied to AI, mathematics, physics, as well as other areas of science and engineering. The series (previously known as Progress in Computer Science and Applied Logic, https://www.springer.com/series/4814) welcomes proposals for research monographs, textbooks and polished lectures, and professional text/references. The scientific content will be of strong interest to both computer scientists and logicians.",

Eilenberg and Mac Lane sought for a systematic way of describing the situations where two things are naturally or essentially the same, or something is universal among others. The first choice of textbook on category theory might be Mac Lane's famous book [1] if you are familiar with various notions in undergraduate mathematics such as groups, rings, modules, homomorphisms, tensor products, continuous mappings in general topology, homology groups in algebraic topology, and so on.

For example, Nakayama's lemma and Zorn's lemma are very well known by mathematicians all over the world and are used once for a while, or touched on once in their schooldays. Sorry, they are not mentioned in this book. In category theory, if you can understand Yoneda's lemma properly, you can consider you graduated from your introductory category theory course. No, is that too much? I must confess that it took me decades to get the Yoneda lemma as a life-long companion just like the formula for the quadratic equations. It might be better to restate that if you can get to the chapter of Yoneda, you've graduated from the introductory course on category theory.",

Therefore, (a -> b) is a functor  $H^{a}$  with a being fixed, and [b] is an image of the List functor. So, forall b. (a->b) -> [b] is a natural transformation  $H^{a} \\rightarrow []$ .
