Foundations and Applied Logic is a growing series that focuses on the foundations of computing and their interaction with applied logic, including how science overall is driven by this. Thus, applications of computer science to mathematical logic, as well as applications of mathematical logic to computer science, will yield many topics of interest. Among other areas, it will cover combinations of logical reasoning and machine learning as applied to AI, mathematics, physics, as well as other areas of science and engineering. The series (previously known as Progress in Computer Science and Applied Logic, https://www.springer.com/series/4814) welcomes proposals for research monographs, textbooks and polished lectures, and professional text/references.

For example, Nakayama's lemma and Zorn's lemma are very well known by mathematicians all over the world and are used once for a while, or touched on once in their schooldays. Sorry, they are not mentioned in this book. In category theory, if you can understand Yoneda's lemma properly, you can consider you graduated from your introductory category theory course. No, is that too much? I must confess that it took me decades to get the Yoneda lemma as a life-long companion just like the formula for the quadratic equations.

functions, and relations, we will see how we are tempted to introduce category theory. After defining the data structures for categories, we will examine some examples. A functor is a function from one category to another that preserves the data structures of the source in its image. Given two categories and two functors between them, a natural transformation is used to compare how the two functors preserve data structures. We will see polymorphic functions in Haskell are natural transformations.","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"page_idx":12,"id":"5e34e8b5-b33b-46db-98cc-e07e4ee4edb8","page_size":[439,666],"block_position":"12-3"},{"bbox":[51,376,173,388],"type":"title","angle":0,"index":4,"text":"# 1.1 Sets and Functions","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"level":1,"page_idx":12,"id":"f44cab17-fbc2-4067-a331-b384f5d2a4ce","page_size":[439,666],"block_position":"12-4"},{"bbox":[50,401,385,460],"type":"text","angle":0,"index":5,"text":"The purpose of the first half of this section is to tempt the reader to use a new device that can handle both functions and their variants such as partial functions and relations.

Then, the gluing is carried out by identifying points  $x_{1} \\in A_{1}$  and  $x_{2} \\in A_{2}$  when there is  $x_{0}$  such that  $x_{1} = a_{1}(x_{0})$  and  $x_{2} = a_{2}(x_{0})$ . Such identification must be extended transitively. This construction is called a disjoint union with gluing.","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"page_idx":82,"id":"59fa21ef-c1c6-4bb2-8f62-75c53590feee","page_size":[439,666],"block_position":"82-9"},{"bbox":[62,508,291,520],"type":"text","angle":0,"index":11,"text":"Haskell code may help you understand what is going on.","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"page_idx":82,"id":"78057e54-d29d-4bce-8bce-a2389c4dd43a","page_size":[439,666],"block_position":"82-10"},{"bbox":[170,527,276,538],"index":12,"angle":0,"type":"table_caption","text":"Listing 3.5 fibercoproduct.hs","id":"477c9b3c-ae6f-448b-841b-1afd452fd40b","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"page_idx":82,"page_size":[439,666],"block_position":"82-11"},{"bbox":[73,540,358,601],"index":13,"angle":0,"type":"table_body","img_path":"/","id":"1a674721-edf8-4d1f-a938-7120398c8d78","color":{"line":"rgba(103, 194, 63, 1)","fill":"rgba(103, 194, 63, 1)"},"table_body":"<table><tr><td>1</td><td>data A0 = Va | Vb | Vc | Vd deriving (Ord, Eq, Enum, Show)</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>data A1 = V1 | V2 | V3 | V4 deriving (Ord, Eq, Enum, Show)</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>data A2 = V5 | V6 | V7 | V8 deriving (Ord, Eq, Enum, Show)</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>-- Disjoint Union with Gluing</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>data DUnG a b c =</td></tr></table>","page_idx":82,"page_size":[439,666],"block_position":"82-12"},{"bbox":[375,35,385,43],"type":"page_number","angle":0,"index":1000000,"text":"73","color":{"line":"rgba(164, 164, 164, 1)","fill":"rgba(164, 164, 164, 1)"},"page_idx":82,"is_discarded":true,"id":"17c01a2c-bfbb-4760-b744-9b4227414fbc","page_size":[439,666],"block_position":"82-13"}],[{"bbox":[291,35,385,44],"type":"header","angle":0,"index":-99998,"text":"3 Universality and Limits","color":{"line":"rgba(164, 164, 164, 1)","fill":"rgba(164, 164, 164, 1)"},"page_idx":83,"is_discarded":true,"id":"875459f3-7298-47fb-a658-f5b0cf58b645","page_size":[439,666],"block_position":"83-0"},{"bbox":[70,58,377,602],"index":2,"angle":0,"type":"code","text":"```haskell\n7 L b | R c | G [b] [c] deriving (Ord, Eq, Show)  \n8  \n9 fibercoproduct :: (Ord a, Ord b, Ord c) =>  \n10 (a -> b) -> (a -> c) -> [a] -> [b] -> [c] -> [DUwG a b c]  \n11 fibercoproduct p q as xs ys =  \n12 [L x | x <- xs, not (x 'elem' (fmap p as)) ] ++  \n13 glue p q as xs ys ++  \n14 [R y | y <- ys, not (y 'elem' (fmap q as)) ]  \n15  \n16 glue :: (Ord a, Ord b, Ord c) =>  \n17 (a -> b) -> (a -> c) -> [a] -> [b] -> [c] -> [DUwG a b c]  \n18 glue p q as xs ys =  \n19 let  \n20 oneStepGlues = [(p a], [q a]) | a<-as]  \n21 classes = collect oneStepGlues  \n22 in  \n23 map (\\xys -> G (fst xys) (snd xys)) classes  \n24  \n25 collect :: (Ord b, Ord c) => [(b], [c]) -> [(b], [c])  \n26 collect [] =  \n27 collect [x] = [x]  \n28 collect (x:xs) =  \n29 fst folded :snd folded  \n30 where  \n31 folded = foldl f (x,[]) (collect xs)  \n32 f (z,zs) y  \n33 | equivQ z y = (merge z y, zs)  \n34 | otherwise = (z, y:zs)  \n35  \n36 equivQ :: (Ord b, Ord c) => ([b], [c]) -> ([b], [c]) -> Bool  \n37 equivQ (bs1,cs1) (bs2,cs2) =  \n38 [x | x <- bs1, y <- bs2, x == y] /= []  \n39 [u | u <- cs1, v <- cs2, u == v] /= []  \n40  \n41 merge :: (Ord b, Ord c) => ([b], [c]) -> ([b], [c]) -> ([b], [c])  \n42 merge (bs1,cs1) (bs2,cs2) =  \n43 (uniq (bs1++bs2),uniq (cs1++cs2))  \n44  \n45 -- unique sort  \n46uniq :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]  \n47uniq xs =  \n48 foldr ins [] xs  \n49 where  \n50 ins y [] = [y]  \n51 ins y (z:zs)  \n52 | y<z = y:z:zs  \n53 | y==z = z:zs  \n54 | otherwise = z:ins y zs  \n55  \n56 ____________  \n57 -- testdata  \n58 -- Both a1 and a2 are injective.  \n59  \n60 a0s = [Va ..

Moggi's ideas are lucid in formulating such uncertain mathematical objects in category theory. The Kleisli triple is the main target of this chapter.","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"page_idx":158,"id":"d9c9255b-c377-4e95-adcc-ff959852dfee","page_size":[439,666],"block_position":"158-2"},{"bbox":[50,363,145,376],"type":"title","angle":0,"index":4,"text":"# 6.1 Kleisli Triples","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"level":1,"page_idx":158,"id":"a2d74b5d-1c3d-48f6-89b7-f697e5267fc7","page_size":[439,666],"block_position":"158-3"},{"bbox":[50,388,386,460],"type":"text","angle":0,"index":5,"text":"Moggi [1] regards a computer program as a process  $TB$  of computing a value of type  $B$  on input of type  $A$ , where, in our case,  $A$  and  $B$  are types such as Int, Float, or String,  $T$  is a functor such as the List or Maybe functors.
