I encourage interested readers to investigate further.","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"page_idx":7,"id":"a43215fc-e839-4f10-b76f-a29d6065612a","page_size":[365,555],"block_position":"7-1"},{"bbox":[39,293,317,425],"type":"text","angle":0,"index":2,"text":"My specific thanks go to Ant Edwards, Tim Fukawa-Connelly, Kevin Houston, Artie Prendergast-Smith, Adrian Simpson, Keith Weber, and Iro Xenidou-Dervou, all of whom gave valuable feedback on chapter drafts. Similarly, to careful readers Romain Lambert, Neil Pratt, and Simon Goss, who were kind enough to point out errors. I am particularly indebted to Colin Foster, who read a draft of the entire book before its chapters went to anyone else. I am also grateful as ever to the team at Oxford University Press, including Dan Taber, Katherine Ward, Chandrakala Chandrasekaran and Richard Hutchinson. Finally, this book is dedicated to Kristian Alcock, who has never known me not to be writing it. I think he will be glad and amazed to see it in print.","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222,

But the two subjects can feel quite different, and awareness of the differences might help with understanding their respective challenges.","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"page_idx":15,"id":"fd74789c-977e-46c4-96d5-1352a4c0f7af","page_size":[365,555],"block_position":"15-3"},{"bbox":[39,398,318,483],"type":"text","angle":0,"index":4,"text":"In Analysis, the main challenge is the reasoning: the subject makes heavy use of logically complex statements, which few students are well equipped to process.

If  $x$  and  $y$  were  $2 \\times 2$  matrices, $^2$  we could not assume that  $xy = yx$  because matrix multiplication works like this:","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"page_idx":23,"id":"c258b853-54e4-4f67-b1f9-3522b13be209","page_size":[365,555],"block_position":"23-3"},{"bbox":[52,339,305,364],"type":"interline_equation","angle":0,"index":4,"text":"$$\n\\left( \\begin{array}{c c} x _ {1 1} & x _ {1 2} \\\\ x _ {2 1} & x _ {2 2} \\end{array} \\right) \\left( \\begin{array}{c c} y _ {1 1} & y _ {1 2} \\\\ y _ {2 1} & y _ {2 2} \\end{array} \\right) = \\left( \\begin{array}{c c} x _ {1 1} y _ {1 1} + x _ {1 2} y _ {2 1} & x _ {1 1} y _ {1 2} + x _ {1 2} y _ {2 2} \\\\ x _ {2 1} y _ {1 1} + x _ {2 2} y _ {2 1} & x _ {2 1} y _ {1 2} + x _ {2 2} y _ {2 2} \\end{array} \\right).\n$$","color":{"line":"rgba(230, 122, 171, 1)","fill":"rgba(230, 122, 171, 1)"},"page_idx":23,"id":"3e38a2f3-be58-41bd-867b-5893c0f938ff","page_size":[365,555],"block_position":"23-4"},{"bbox":[48,375,111,386],"type":"text","angle":0,"index":5,"text":"So, for example,","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"page_idx":23,"id":"e63fe10e-b96c-4f58-8539-e47133daaa7a","page_size":[365,555],"block_position":"23-5"},{"bbox":[69,397,287,422],"type":"interline_equation","angle":0,"index":6,"text":"$$\n\\left( \\begin{array}{c c} 1 & 2 \\\\ 3 & 4 \\end{array} \\right) \\left( \\begin{array}{c c} 5 & 6 \\\\ 7 & 8 \\end{array} \\right) = \\left( \\begin{array}{c c} 5 + 1 4 & 6 + 1 6 \\\\ 1 5 + 2 8 & 1 8 + 3 2 \\end{array} \\right) = \\left( \\begin{array}{c c} 1 9 & 2 2 \\\\ 4 3 & 5 0 \\end{array} \\right)\n$$","color":{"line":"rgba(230, 122, 171, 1)","fill":"rgba(230, 122, 171, 1)"},"page_idx":23,"id":"38508252-c6e1-47f5-902a-060fd8c9f867","page_size":[365,555],"block_position":"23-6"},{"bbox":[39,455,316,483],"type":"text","angle":0,"index":7,"text":"This book includes examples based on matrices and complex numbers.

Binary operations might be commutative on some sets but not on others. In some sets there are few ways to combine objects to give zero; in others, there are many. Thus, 'facts' that are true for one operation on one set do not necessarily hold elsewhere, and Abstract Algebra requires concentration to ensure that you do not overgeneralize from a familiar context. I won't lie: this is hard. When you are accustomed to 'doing' algebra in numerical contexts, it might not require much effort. The manipulations become natural enough that you do them easily, much as you might walk or type easily. And concentrating on something that you do easily feels weird and disruptive. If you concentrate on your muscles as you walk, you become slow and ungainly. If you can touch-type, but you force yourself to look at the keyboard and think about which letters you want, you might find that you can't type at all. Focusing on why algebraic manipulations are valid can feel similar: slow, clunky and therefore like a step backward in your learning rather than a step forward.

A general operation might be denoted by  $^{\\star \\star}$ , but that tends to disappear once Abstract Algebra gets going, for two reasons. First, specific operations often come with notation:  $^+$  for addition,  $^{\\times}$  or  $^{\\cdot \\cdot}$  or juxtaposition for multiplication,  $^{\\circ}$  for function composition. Second, Abstract Algebra involves theory building, constructing general proofs that apply to all groups or all rings. For rings, the two operations are closely linked to standard addition and multiplication so they are usually denoted by  $^+$  and either  $^{\\cdot \\cdot}$  or juxtaposition. For groups, there is more variety, which demands notational decisions. To write about all groups, we want notation that does not mislead us into thinking about specific operations;  $^{\\star \\star}$  is good for that.

An equivalence relation is a subset of  $X \\times X$  because only some elements are related to each other (usually). For instance, for the above equivalence relation on  $X = \\{a_1, a_2, a_3, b_1, b_2, b_3, c_1, c_2, c_3\\}$ , the grid below has dots at all points  $(x, y)$  for which  $x \\sim y$ .

For instance, multiplication on the integers takes two integers and gives another, as in  $2 \\times 5 = 10$ . To capture the effects of a binary operation, tables can be useful. A table cannot show 'all' the results for an infinite set like the integers, but it can visually represent an operation's properties.

More often in Abstract Algebra we speak about addition or multiplication, then ask whether additive and multiplicative inverses exist. Second, you might have noticed that I have discussed how closure, identities, inverses and commutativity are reflected in binary operation tables. I have not done the same for associativity. Why is that, do you think? There are two reasons. One is that associativity is about triples of elements in expressions like  $(s_1*s_2)*s_3$ . A table cannot represent these because it is only two-dimensional—how could a hypothetical three-dimensional 'table' be used to check whether  $(s_1*s_2)*s_3 = s_1*(s_2*s_3)$ ?

Save your table for reference, then decide whether you have enough insight to imagine its equivalent for the symmetries of a regular pentagon or hexagon, or whether it would be worth making tables for those too.","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"page_idx":117,"id":"38c90f32-d281-445e-9ed2-e1e88d696754","page_size":[365,555],"block_position":"117-2"},{"bbox":[39,370,317,470],"type":"text","angle":0,"index":3,"text":"To conclude this section, note that an alternative, number-based labelling provides another way to represent symmetries.

In everyday life, the words group and set are used pretty interchangeably. In some situations, one or the other might sound more natural—a group of friends, a set of cutlery—but the meaning is usually a collection of things that go together. In mathematics, this is not the case: the words group and set have different mathematical meanings. A mathematical set is simply a collection of objects. These objects might have something in common, but that is not necessary—a set need not have special properties. A mathematical group, on the other hand, does have special properties. A group  $(G,*)$  is a set  $G$  with a binary operation  $*$  that satisfies four $^1$  axioms as in the definition below (first discussed in Sections 1.3 and 2.3).

They are not inferior, of course—any set that meets the definition of a subgroup is a subgroup. But normal subgroups do have extra properties. To understand those properties, we will work out what distinguishes normal subgroups from other subgroups.","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"page_idx":182,"id":"ebdb8df3-1aaf-44cc-98c3-d07a7cbb3ad1","page_size":[365,555],"block_position":"182-0"},{"bbox":[47,197,324,280],"type":"text","angle":0,"index":1,"text":"For all subgroups, calculating cosets is straightforward from the definition.

However, it turns out that the cosets of any subgroup do partition the group, which can be proved by generalizing an argument from Section 3.4. First, (left) cosets leave nothing out because for every group  $G$ , every subgroup  $H$  contains the identity  $e$ . So, for every element  $a \\in G$ , the element  $a = ae$  is in the coset  $aH$ .

Also, the identity alone is always a subgroup, and must be normal because for every  $a \\in G$ ,  $a\\{e\\} = ae = a = ea = \\{e\\}a$ . So every group has at least two normal subgroups.

But it is not obvious, so I can try to count. There is the identity rotation, obviously, plus three non-identity rotations about each of three distinct face-centred axes. That is ten so far. Then there is one rotation through each of the six axes joining the midpoints of opposite edges. That takes us to 16.

Then follow the arrow, setting  $\\phi(1)$  to be the first rational it ‘hits’,  $\\phi(2)$  to be the second, and so on, ignoring the repeats (for instance,  $-1$  is ‘counted’ so  $-\\frac{2}{2}$  is ignored).","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"page_idx":221,"id":"a63d0a87-92b1-4270-b935-6c99e67b472b","page_size":[365,555],"block_position":"221-1"},{"bbox":[66,275,290,394],"type":"interline_equation","angle":0,"index":2,"text":"$$\n\\begin{array}{c c c c c c c c c c} \\ldots & - 4 & - 3 & - 2 & - 1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & \\ldots \\\\ \\ldots & - \\frac {4}{2} & - \\frac {3}{2} & - \\frac {2}{2} & - \\frac {1}{2} & \\frac {0}{2} & \\frac {1}{2} & \\frac {2}{2} & \\frac {3}{2} & \\frac {4}{2} & \\ldots \\\\ \\ldots & - \\frac {4}{3} & - \\frac {3}{3} & - \\frac {2}{3} & - \\frac {1}{3} & \\frac {0}{3} & \\frac {1}{3} & \\frac {2}{3} & \\frac {3}{3} & \\frac {4}{3} & \\ldots \\\\ \\ldots & - \\frac {4}{4} & - \\frac {3}{4} & - \\frac {2}{4} & - \\frac {1}{4} & \\frac {0}{4} & \\frac {1}{4} & \\frac {2}{4} & \\frac {3}{4} & \\frac {4}{4} & \\ldots \\\\ \\ldots & - \\frac {4}{5} & - \\frac {3}{5} & - \\frac {2}{5} & - \\frac {1}{5} & \\frac {0}{5} & \\frac {1}{5} & \\frac {2}{5} & \\frac {3}{5} & \\frac {4}{5} & \\ldots \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots & \\end{array}\n$$","color":{"line":"rgba(230, 122, 171, 1)","fill":"rgba(230, 122, 171, 1)"},"page_idx":221,"id":"e9c51e48-4909-435a-b01f-44a7f367589d","page_size":[365,555],"block_position":"221-2"},{"bbox":[40,406,315,420],"type":"interline_equation","angle":0,"index":3,"text":"$$\n\\phi (1) = 0 \\quad \\phi (2) = 1 \\quad \\phi (3) = \\frac {1}{2} \\quad \\phi (4) = - \\frac {1}{2} \\quad \\phi (5) = - 1 \\quad \\phi (6) = - 2 \\dots\n$$","color":{"line":"rgba(230, 122, 171, 1)","fill":"rgba(230, 122, 171, 1)"},"page_idx":221,"id":"4a2ce9aa-3a1e-4398-93a1-f05e15437f47","page_size":[365,555],"block_position":"221-3"},{"bbox":[39,431,316,455],"type":"text","angle":0,"index":4,"text":"This defines a bijection because  $\\phi$  matches each natural to a rational without leaving any out or sending two naturals to the same rational.","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"page_idx":221,"id":"2d091bb7-08e3-4ec0-8388-66bdb6b34592","page_size":[365,555],"block_position":"221-4"},{"bbox":[183,493,282,502],"type":"footer","angle":0,"index":1000004,"text":"ISOMORPHIC OR NOT?","color":{"line":"rgba(164, 164, 164, 1)","fill":"rgba(164, 164, 164, 1)"},"page_idx":221,"is_discarded":true,"id":"79542d6b-6fd4-4119-a912-99c523d80b3e","page_size":[365,555],"block_position":"221-5"},{"bbox":[298,492,316,502],"type":"page_number","angle":0,"index":1000005,"text":"203","color":{"line":"rgba(164, 164, 164, 1)","fill":"rgba(164, 164, 164, 1)"},"page_idx":221,"is_discarded":true,"id":"8826cf15-e7b0-463b-9354-96276e44c193","page_size":[365,555],"block_position":"221-6"}],[{"bbox":[46,41,325,76],"type":"text","angle":0,"index":0,"text":"Is  $\\phi$  an isomorphism?

That makes it worth investing an hour or two in finding a book that you find helpful. I recommend going to your university's library and assembling five or six Abstract Algebra books. Find those recommended by your lecturer, then scan the shelves for any of which there are multiple copies—someone, at some point, thought these worth ordering.

It is then worth thinking about why a meaningful understanding provides a strong base for constructing proofs and for doing well in Abstract Algebra. I would list three reasons. First, when trying to prove something, you will often have access to a lot of possibly useful axioms, definitions and earlier theorems; deciding which to use is much easier with clear understanding of what each one says. Second, the theorems of Abstract Algebra are all expressed in similar notation; students who do not really understand them can easily muddle them up. Third, it is difficult to remember things that are not meaningfully understood. I certainly would not want to attempt an Abstract Algebra exam based on brute-force memorization. I am sure it can be done, but I have long thought that students who get the top marks probably work on average less hard than those who get slightly lower marks, because they are doing a different and, in the long run, slightly easier task. Acquiring meaningful understanding requires a lot of up-front effort, but meaningful understanding sticks.","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"page_idx":279,"id":"8a96c3c6-93c5-4842-9e91-83767b3a0b85","page_size":[365,555],"block_position":"279-1"},{"bbox":[220,493,281,502],"type":"footer","angle":0,"index":1000001,"text":"CONCLUSION","color":{"line":"rgba(164, 164, 164, 1)","fill":"rgba(164, 164, 164, 1)"},"page_idx":279,"is_discarded":true,"id":"78bf42a0-77a7-437d-a8bd-fcdae7b3da9f","page_size":[365,555],"block_position":"279-2"},{"bbox":[298,492,314,501],"type":"page_number","angle":0,"index":1000002,"text":"261","color":{"line":"rgba(164, 164, 164, 1)","fill":"rgba(164, 164, 164, 1)"},"page_idx":279,"is_discarded":true,"id":"4403d1bf-0d6b-4436-b8bc-3c4433e04229","page_size":[365,555],"block_position":"279-3"}],[],[{"bbox":[40,71,162,88],"type":"title","angle":0,"index":0,"text":"# BIBLIOGRAPHY","color":{"line":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)","fill":"rgba(13, 83, 222, 1)"},"level":1,"page_idx":281,"id":"86ecaa91-0d5d-4949-9511-5c2da8414d43","page_size":[365,555],"block_position":"281-0"},{"bbox":[40,124,316,148],"type":"ref_text","angle":0,"index":1,"text":"Ainsworth, S., & Loizou, A.
