What are its subgroups? Think carefully here. The group  $D_{5}$  is bigger than  $D_{4}$ , so it has room for more internal structure. But a square has two different 'types' of reflection: those with vertex-to-vertex axes and those with mid-edge-to-mid-edge axes. A regular pentagon does not: like a triangle, its reflections all have vertex-to-mid-edge axes. Moreover, its subgroups must each have order 1, 2, 5 or 10. Can you list them all?

So we see from Example 5 that the possible values for  $|x|$  are 4 and 12. If  $|x| = 4$ , then  $(1234) = x^3 = x^{-1}$  and therefore  $x = (4321)$ . If  $|x| = 12$ , then  $x = (4321)(567)$  or  $x = (4321))(576)$  since no other choices yield  $x^3 = (1234)$ .
