Then  $x^{p^m} = e$  for all  $x$  in  $G$ . We may assume that  $G \neq \langle a \rangle$ , for otherwise there is nothing to prove. Now, among all the elements of  $G$ , choose  $b$  of smallest order such that  $b \notin \langle a \rangle$ . We claim that  $\langle a \rangle \cap \langle b \rangle = \{e\}$ . Since  $|b^p| = |b| / p$ , we know that  $b^p \in \langle a \rangle$  by the manner in which  $b$  was chosen. Say  $b^p = a^i$ . Notice that  $e = b^{p^m} = (b^p)^{p^{m-1}} = (a^i)^{p^{m-1}}$ , so  $|a^i| \leq p^{m-1}$ . Thus,  $a^i$  is not a generator of  $\langle a \rangle$  and, therefore by Corollary 3 to Theorem 4.2,  $\gcd(p^m, i) \neq 1$ . This proves that  $p$  divides  $i$ , so that we can write  $i = pj$ .

Also  $c^p = a^{-jp}b^p = a^{-i}b^p = b^{-p}b^p = e$ . Thus, we have found an element  $c$  of order  $p$  such that  $c \notin \langle a \rangle$ .

Since any automorphism of  $K = Q(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5)$  is completely determined by its action on the  $a$ 's and must permute the  $a$ 's, we know that  $\operatorname{Gal}(K / Q)$  is isomorphic to a subgroup of  $S_5$ , the symmetric group on five symbols. Since  $a_1$  is a zero of an irreducible polynomial of degree 5 over  $Q$ , we know that  $[Q(a_1):Q] = 5$ , and therefore 5 divides  $[K:Q]$ . Thus, the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory tells us that 5 also divides  $|\operatorname{Gal}(K / Q)|$ . So, by Cauchy's Theorem (corollary to Theorem 24.3), we may conclude that  $\operatorname{Gal}(K / Q)$  has an element of order 5. Since the only elements in  $S_5$  of order 5 are the 5-cycles, we know that  $\operatorname{Gal}(K / Q)$  contains a 5-cycle.

We have already proven that there is, in essence, the same number of rational numbers as integers. This may not come as too much of a shock, since both sets are infinite, so logically two infinite sets ought to be the same size. But the set of real numbers is also infinite, so one might be tempted to think that there is the same number of real numbers as integers. However, the number of reals is ""more infinite"" than the number of integers. In other words, we cannot construct a sequence of real numbers that contains every real number, as we did for rational numbers.

This same observation has already been highlighted in a study by González (1997), describing three groups of pupil-constructed concept maps, each sharing common characteristics. In the case that concerns us, it was possible to observe similar groupings of maps with similar characteristics. Thus, one of the first tendencies to be observed was the obvious restructuring in the post-instruction map made by three of our pupils, who were able to produce something very close to the reference map they had been shown.

Since  $|b^p| = |b| / p$ , we know that  $b^p \in \langle a \rangle$  by the manner in which  $b$  was chosen. Say  $b^p = a^i$ . Notice that  $e = b^{p^m} = (b^p)^{p^{m-1}} = (a^i)^{p^{m-1}}$ , so  $|a^i| \leq p^{m-1}$ .

Since any automorphism of  $K = Q(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5)$  is completely determined by its action on the  $a$ 's and must permute the  $a$ 's, we know that  $\operatorname{Gal}(K / Q)$  is isomorphic to a subgroup of  $S_5$ , the symmetric group on five symbols. Since  $a_1$  is a zero of an irreducible polynomial of degree 5 over  $Q$ , we know that  $[Q(a_1):Q] = 5$ , and therefore 5 divides  $[K:Q]$ . Thus, the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory tells us that 5 also divides  $|\operatorname{Gal}(K / Q)|$ . So, by Cauchy's Theorem (corollary to Theorem 24.3), we may conclude that  $\operatorname{Gal}(K / Q)$  has an element of order 5. Since the only elements in  $S_5$  of order 5 are the 5-cycles, we know that  $\operatorname{Gal}(K / Q)$  contains a 5-cycle.

But, the only subgroup of  $S_5$  that contains both a 5-cycle and a 2-cycle is  $S_5$ . (See Exercise 25 in Chapter 24.) So,  $\operatorname{Gal}(K / Q)$  is isomorphic to  $S_5$ .

In the case that concerns us, it was possible to observe similar groupings of maps with similar characteristics. Thus, one of the first tendencies to be observed was the obvious restructuring in the post-instruction map made by three of our pupils, who were able to produce something very close to the reference map they had been shown.
