# Contemporary Abstract Algebra

Contemporary Abstract Algebra, Eleventh Edition is intended for a course whose main purpose is to enable students to do computations and write proofs. This text stresses the importance of obtaining a solid introduction to the traditional topics, while at the same time presenting abstract algebra as a contemporary and very much active subject, which is currently being used by working physicists, chemists, and computer scientists.

For nearly four decades, this classic text has been widely appreciated by instructors and students alike. The book offers an enjoyable read and conveys and develops enthusiasm for the beauty of the topics presented. It is comprehensive, lively, and engaging.

Students will learn how to do computations and write proofs. A unique feature of the book are exercises that build the skill of generalizing, a skill that students should develop, but rarely do.

Examples elucidate the definitions, theorems, and proof techniques; exercises facilitate understanding, provide insight, and develop the ability to do proofs. The hallmark features of previous editions of the book are enhanced in this edition. These include:

- A good mixture of approximately 1900 computational and theoretical exercises appearing in each chapter that synthesizes concepts from multiple chapters  
- Back-of-the-book skeleton solutions and hints to odd-numbered exercises  
Over 300 worked-out examples ranging from routine computations to the more challenging  
- Links to interactive True/False questions with comments  
- Links to computer exercises that utilize interactive software available on the author's website, stressing guessing and making conjectures  
- Many applications from scientific and computing fields, as well as some from everyday life  
Numerous historical notes and biographies that spotlight the people and events behind the mathematics  
Motivational and humorous quotations  
- Hundreds of figures, photographs, and tables

Changes to the eleventh edition include new exercises, examples, biographies, and quotes, and an enrichment of the discussion portions. These changes accentuate and enhance the hallmark features that have made previous editions of the book a comprehensive, lively, and engaging introduction to the subject.

While many partial solutions and sketches for the odd-numbered exercises appear in the book, an Instructor's Solutions Manual offers solutions for all the exercises. A Student's Solution Manual has comprehensive solutions for all odd-numbered exercises, many even-numbered exercises, and numerous alternative solutions as well.

Joseph A. Gallian earned his PhD from Notre Dame. In addition to receiving numerous national awards for his teaching and exposition, he has served terms as the second vice president and president of the Mathematical Association of America, published more than 100 articles, and authored six books. Numerous articles about his work have appeared in national news outlets, including the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Boston Globe, and Newsweek, among many others.

# Preface

For those who have eyes to see—groups, rings, and fields are everywhere.

Hendrik W. Lenstra, Jr

Lenstra's observation encapsulates the content and purpose of this book. I want students to receive a solid introduction to the traditional topics. I want readers to come away with the view that abstract algebra is a contemporary subject—that its concepts and methodologies are being used by working mathematicians, computer scientists, physicists, and chemists. I want students to see the connections between abstract algebra and number theory and geometry. I want students to be able to do computations and to write proofs. I want students to enjoy reading the book. And I want to convey to the reader my enthusiasm for this beautiful subject.

Educational research has shown that an effective way of learning mathematics is to interweave worked-out examples and practice problems. Thus, I have made examples and exercises the heart of the book. The examples elucidate the definitions, theorems, and proof techniques. The exercises facilitate understanding, provide insight, and develop the ability of the students to do proofs. There is a large number of exercises ranging from straightforward to difficult and enough at each level so that instructors have plenty to choose from that are most appropriate for their students. The exercises often foreshadow definitions, concepts, and theorems to come. Many exercises focus on special cases and ask the reader to generalize. Generalizing is a skill that students should develop but rarely do. Even if an instructor chooses not to spend class time on the applications in the book, I feel that having them there demonstrates to students the utility of the theory.

Changes for the eleventh edition include new exercises, new examples, new biographies, new quotes, and an enrichment of the discussions. These changes accentuate and enhance the hallmark features that have made previous editions of the book a comprehensive, lively, and engaging introduction to the subject:

- Extensive coverage of groups, rings, and fields, plus a variety of non-traditional special topics  
- A good mixture of approximately 1900 computational and theoretical exercises appearing in each chapter that synthesize concepts from multiple chapters  
- Back-of-the-book skeleton solutions and hints to the odd-numbered exercises

Over 300 worked-out examples ranging from routine computations to quite challenging  
- Many applications from scientific and computing fields, as well as some from everyday life  
- Numerous historical notes and biographies that spotlight the people and events behind the mathematics  
Motivational and humorous quotations  
- Hundreds of figures, photographs, and tables

The Student Solutions Manual is available from CRC Press (ISBN: 9781032779577). It has detailed solutions for all odd-numbered exercises and every other even-numbered exercise. Instructor resources are available from CRC Press for qualified adopters. Please go to https://www.routledge.com/ Contemporary-Abstract-Algebra/Gallian/p/book/9781032778914.

# Properties of Integers

It should not come as a surprise that much of abstract algebra involves properties of integers and sets. In this chapter we collect the properties we need for future reference. An important property of the integers, which we will often use, is the so-called Well Ordering Principle. Since this property cannot be proved from the usual properties of arithmetic, we will take it as an axiom.

# Well Ordering Principle

Every nonempty set of positive integers contains a smallest member.

The concept of divisibility plays a fundamental role in the theory of numbers. We say a nonzero integer  $t$  is a divisor of an integer  $s$  if there is an integer  $u$  such that  $s = tu$ . In this case, we write  $t \mid s$  (read "  $t$  divides  $s$  ). When  $t$  is not a divisor of  $s$ , we write  $t \nmid s$ . A prime is a positive integer greater than 1 whose only positive divisors are 1 and itself. We say an integer  $s$  is a multiple of an integer  $t$  if there is an integer  $u$  such that  $s = tu$  or, equivalently, if  $t$  is a divisor of  $s$ .

As our first application of the Well Ordering Principle, we establish a fundamental property of integers that we will use often.

# Theorem 0.1 Division Algorithm

Let  $a$  and  $b$  be integers with  $b > 0$ . Then there exist unique integers  $q$  and  $r$  with the property that  $a = bq + r$ , where  $0 \leq r < b$ .

PROOF We begin with the existence portion of the theorem. Consider the set  $S = \{a - bk \mid k$  is an integer and  $a - bk \geq 0\}$ . If  $0 \in S$ , then  $b$  divides  $a$  and we may obtain the desired result with  $q = a / b$  and  $r = 0$ . Now assume  $0 \notin S$ . Since  $S$  is nonempty [if  $a > 0$ ,  $a - b \cdot 0 \in S$ ; if  $a < 0$ ,  $a - b(2a) = a(1 - 2b) \in S$ ;  $a \neq 0$  since  $0 \notin S$ ], we may apply the Well Ordering Principle to conclude that  $S$  has a smallest member, say  $r = a - bq$ . Then  $a = bq + r$  and  $r \geq 0$ , so all that remains to be proved is that  $r < b$ .

If  $r \geq b$ , then  $a - b(q + 1) = a - bq - b = r - b \geq 0$ , so that  $a - b(q + 1) \in S$ . But  $a - b(q + 1) < a - bq$ , and  $a - bq$  is the smallest member of  $S$ . So,  $r < b$ .

To establish the uniqueness of  $q$  and  $r$ , let us suppose that there are integers  $q, q', r$ , and  $r'$  such that

$$
a = b q + r, 0 \leq r <   b, \text {a n d} a = b q ^ {\prime} + r ^ {\prime}, \quad 0 \leq r ^ {\prime} <   b.
$$

For convenience, we may also suppose that  $r' \geq r$ . Then  $bq + r = bq' + r'$  and  $b(q - q') = r' - r$ . So,  $b$  divides  $r' - r$  and  $0 \leq r' - r \leq r' < b$ . It follows that  $r' - r = 0$ , and therefore  $r' = r$  and  $q = q'$ .

The integer  $q$  in the division algorithm is called the quotient upon dividing  $a$  by  $b$ ; the integer  $r$  is called the remainder upon dividing  $a$  by  $b$ .

EXAMPLE 1 For  $a = 17$  and  $b = 5$ , the division algorithm gives  $17 = 5 \cdot 3 + 2$ ; for  $a = -23$  and  $b = 6$ , the division algorithm gives  $-23 = 6(-4) + 1$ .

There are many instances in this book where there are integers  $a$  and  $b$  and we will want to show that  $a$  is divisible by  $b$ . In such cases it is usually best to proceed by writing  $a = bq + r$ , where  $0 \leq r < b$  and use properties of  $a$  and  $b$  to show that  $r = 0$ . The proof of Theorem 0.2 is one such instance.

# Definitions Greatest Common Divisor, Relatively Prime Integers

The greatest common divisor of two nonzero integers  $a$  and  $b$  is the largest of all common divisors of  $a$  and  $b$ . We denote this integer by  $\gcd(a, b)$ . When  $\gcd(a, b) = 1$ , we say  $a$  and  $b$  are relatively prime.

The following property of the greatest common divisor of two integers plays a critical role in abstract algebra. The proof provides an application of the division algorithm and our second application of the Well Ordering Principle.

# Theorem 0.2 GCD is a Linear Combination

For any nonzero integers  $a$  and  $b$ , there exist integers  $s$  and  $t$  such that  $\gcd(a, b) = as + bt$ . Moreover,  $\gcd(a, b)$  is the smallest positive integer of the form  $as + bt$ .

PROOF Consider the set  $S = \{am + bn \mid m, n$  are integers and  $am + bn > 0\}$ . Since  $S$  is obviously nonempty (if some choice of  $m$  and  $n$  makes  $am + bn < 0$ , then replace  $m$  and  $n$  by  $-m$  and  $-n$ ), the Well Ordering Principle asserts

that  $S$  has a smallest member, say,  $d = as + bt$ . We claim that  $d = \gcd(a, b)$ . To verify this claim, use the division algorithm to write  $a = dq + r$ , where  $0 \leq r < d$ . If  $r > 0$ , then  $r = a - dq = a - (as + bt)q = a - asq - btq = a(1 - sq) + b(-tq) \in S$ , contradicting the fact that  $d$  is the smallest member of  $S$ . So,  $r = 0$  and  $d$  divides  $a$ . Analogously (or, better yet, by symmetry),  $d$  divides  $b$  as well. This proves that  $d$  is a common divisor of  $a$  and  $b$ . Now suppose  $d'$  is another common divisor of  $a$  and  $b$  and write  $a = d'h$  and  $b = d'k$ . Then  $d = as + bt = (d'h)s + (d'k)t = d'(hs + kt)$ , so that  $d'$  is a divisor of  $d$ . Thus, among all common divisors of  $a$  and  $b$ ,  $d$  is the greatest.

The special case of Theorem 0.2 when  $a$  and  $b$  are relatively prime is so important in abstract algebra that we single it out as a corollary.

# Corollary

Integers  $a$  and  $b$  are relatively prime if and only if there exist integers  $s$  and  $t$  such that  $as + bt = 1$ .

EXAMPLE 2  $\gcd(4,15) = 1$ ;  $\gcd(4,10) = 2$ ;  $\gcd(2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5, 2 \cdot 3^3 \cdot 7^2) = 2 \cdot 3^2$ . Note that 4 and 15 are relatively prime, whereas 4 and 10 are not. Also,  $4 \cdot 4 + 15(-1) = 1$  and  $4(-2) + 10 \cdot 1 = 2$ .

The corollary of Theorem 0.2 provides a convenient method to show that two integers represented by polynomial expressions are relatively prime.

EXAMPLE 3 For any integer  $n$  the integers  $n + 1$  and  $n^2 + n + 1$  are relatively prime. To verify this we observe that  $n^2 + n + 1 - n(n + 1) = 1$ .

The next lemma is frequently used. It appeared in Euclid's Elements.

# Lemma 0.1 Euclid's Lemma  $p \mid ab$  implies  $p \mid a$  or  $p \mid b$

If  $p$  is a prime that divides  $ab$ , then  $p$  divides  $a$  or  $p$  divides  $b$ .

PROOF Suppose  $p$  is a prime that divides  $ab$  but does not divide  $a$ . We must show that  $p$  divides  $b$ . Since  $p$  does not divide  $a$ , there are integers  $s$  and  $t$  such that  $1 = as + pt$ . Then  $b = abs + ptb$ , and since  $p$  divides the right-hand side of this equation,  $p$  also divides  $b$ .

Note that Euclid's Lemma may fail when  $p$  is not a prime, since  $6 \mid (4 \cdot 3)$  but  $6 \nmid 4$  and  $6 \nmid 3$ .

Why are primes important? Our next property shows that the primes are the building blocks for all integers. We will often use this property without explicitly saying so.

# Theorem 0.3 Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic

Every integer greater than 1 is a prime or a product of primes. This product is unique, except for the order in which the factors appear. That is, if  $n = p_1p_2 \cdots p_r$  and  $n = q_1q_2 \cdots q_s$ , where the  $p$ 's and  $q$ 's are primes, then  $r = s$  and, after renumbering the  $q$ 's, we have  $p_i = q_i$  for all  $i$ .

We will prove the existence portion of Theorem 0.3 later in this chapter (Example 14). The uniqueness portion is a consequence of Euclid's Lemma (Exercise 31). Here is a fun application of Theorem 0.3.

EXAMPLE 4 Let  $n$  be any integer greater than 1,  $\sqrt[n]{2}$  is irrational. For if  $\sqrt[n]{2} = a / b$  where  $a$  and  $b$  are integers, and  $a / b$  is in lowest terms, then  $a^n = 2b^n$ . By Theorem 0.3 we know 2 divides  $a$ , say  $a = 2c$ . Then  $2^n c^n = 2b^n$  and therefore  $2^{n-1}c^n = b^n$ . But this implies that 2 divides  $b$ . This contradicts our assumption that  $a / b$  was in lowest terms.

Another concept that frequently arises is that of the least common multiple of two integers.

# Definition Least Common Multiple

The least common multiple of two nonzero integers  $a$  and  $b$  is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both  $a$  and  $b$ . We will denote this integer by  $\operatorname{lcm}(a, b)$ .

We leave it as an exercise (Exercise 12) to prove that every common multiple of  $a$  and  $b$  is a multiple of  $\operatorname{lcm}(a, b)$ .

EXAMPLE 5  $\operatorname{lcm}(4,6) = 12$ ;  $\operatorname{lcm}(4,8) = 8$ ;  $\operatorname{lcm}(10,12) = 60$ ;  $\operatorname{lcm}(6,5) = 30$ ;  $\operatorname{lcm}(2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5, 2 \cdot 3^3 \cdot 7^2) = 2^2 \cdot 3^3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7^2$ .

# Modular Arithmetic

Another application of the division algorithm that will be important to us is modular arithmetic. Modular arithmetic is an abstraction of a method of counting that you often use. For example, if it is now September, what month will it be 25 months from now? Of course, the answer is October, but the interesting fact is that you didn't arrive at the answer by starting with September and counting off 25 months. Instead, without even thinking about it, you simply observed that  $25 = 2 \cdot 12 + 1$ , and you added 1 month to September. Similarly, if it is now Wednesday, you know that in 23 days it will be Friday. This time, you arrived at your answer by noting that  $23 = 7 \cdot 3 + 2$ , so you added 2 days to Wednesday instead of counting off 23 days. If your electricity is off for 26 hours, you must advance your clock 2 hours, since  $26 = 2 \cdot 12 + 2$ . Surprisingly, this simple idea has numerous important applications in mathematics and computer science. You will see a few of them in this section. We shall see many more in later chapters.

The following notation is convenient. When  $a = qn + r$ , where  $q$  is the quotient and  $r$  is the remainder upon dividing  $a$  by  $n$ , we write  $a \bmod n = r$ . Thus,

$$
\begin{array}{l} 3 \bmod 2 = 1 \text {s i n c e} 3 = 1 \cdot 2 + 1, \\ 6 \bmod 2 = 0 \text {s i n c e} 6 = 3 \cdot 2 + 0, \\ 1 1 \bmod 3 = 2 \text {s i n c e} 1 1 = 3 \cdot 3 + 2, \\ 6 2 \bmod 8 5 = 6 2 \text {s i n c e} 6 2 = 0 \cdot 8 5 + 6 2, \\ - 2 \bmod 1 5 = 1 3 \text {s i n c e} - 2 = (- 1) 1 5 + 1 3. \\ \end{array}
$$

In general, if  $a$  and  $b$  are integers and  $n$  is a positive integer, then  $a \mod n = b \mod n$  if and only if  $n$  divides  $a - b$  (Exercise 9).

In our applications, we will use addition and multiplication mod  $n$ . When you wish to compute  $ab \mod n$  or  $(a + b) \mod n$ , and  $a$  or  $b$  is greater than  $n$ , it is easier to "mod first." For example, to compute  $(27 \cdot 36) \mod 11$ , we note that  $27 \mod 11 = 5$  and  $36 \mod 11 = 3$ , so  $(27 \cdot 36) \mod 11 = (5 \cdot 3) \mod 11 = 4$ . (See Exercise 11.)

Modular arithmetic is often used in assigning an extra digit to identification numbers for the purpose of detecting forgery or errors. We present two such applications.

EXAMPLE 6 The United States Postal Service money order shown in Figure 0.1 has an identification number consisting of 10 digits together with an extra digit called a check. The check digit is the 10-digit number modulo 9. Thus, the number 3953988164 has the check digit 2, since 3953988164 mod  $9 = 2$ . If the number 39539881642 were incorrectly entered into a computer (programmed to calculate the check digit) as, say, 39559881642 (an error in the fourth position), the machine would calculate the check digit as 4, whereas the entered check digit would be 2. Thus, the error would be detected.

The method used by the Postal Service does not detect all single-digit errors (see Exercise 41). However, detection of all single-digit errors, as well as nearly all errors involving the transposition of two adjacent digits, is easily achieved. One method that does this is the one used to assign the so-called Universal Product Code (UPC) to most retail items (see Figure 0.2). A UPC identification number has 12 digits. The first six digits identify the manufacturer, the next five identify the product, and the last is a check. (For many items, the 12th digit is not printed, but it is always bar-coded.) In Figure 0.2, the check digit is 8.

To explain how the check digit is calculated, it is convenient to introduce the dot product notation for two  $k$ -tuples:

$$
\left(a _ {1}, a _ {2}, \dots , a _ {k}\right) \cdot \left(w _ {1}, w _ {2}, \dots , w _ {k}\right) = a _ {1} w _ {1} + a _ {2} w _ {2} + \dots + a _ {k} w _ {k}.
$$

Figure 0.2 UPC bar code.

An item with the UPC identification number  $a_1a_2 \cdots a_{12}$  satisfies the condition

$$
\left(a _ {1}, a _ {2}, \dots , a _ {1 2}\right) \cdot \left(3, 1, 3, 1, \dots , 3, 1\right) \bmod 1 0 = 0.
$$

To verify that the number in Figure 0.2 satisfies this condition, we calculate

$$
\begin{array}{l} (0 \cdot 3 + 2 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 3 + 0 \cdot 1 + 0 \cdot 3 + 0 \cdot 1 + 6 \cdot 3 + 5 \cdot 1 \\ + 8 \cdot 3 + 9 \cdot 1 + 7 \cdot 3 + 8 \cdot 1) \mod 1 0 = 9 0 \mod 1 0 = 0. \\ \end{array}
$$

The fixed  $k$ -tuple used in the calculation of check digits is called the weighting vector.

Now suppose a single error is made in entering the number in Figure 0.2 into a computer. Say, for instance, that 021000958978 is entered (notice that the seventh digit is incorrect). Then the computer calculates

$$
\begin{array}{l} 0 \cdot 3 + 2 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 3 + 0 \cdot 1 + 0 \cdot 3 + 0 \cdot 1 + 9 \cdot 3 \\ + 5 \cdot 1 + 8 \cdot 3 + 9 \cdot 1 + 7 \cdot 3 + 8 \cdot 1 = 9 9. \\ \end{array}
$$

Since 99 mod  $10 \neq 0$ , the entered number cannot be correct.

In general, any single error will result in a sum that is not 0 modulo 10.

The advantage of the UPC scheme is that it will detect nearly all errors involving the transposition of two adjacent digits as well as all errors involving one digit. For doubters, let us say that the identification number given in

Figure 0.2 is entered as 021000658798. Notice that the last two digits preceding the check digit have been transposed. But by calculating the dot product, we obtain  $94 \mod 10 \neq 0$ , so we have detected an error. In fact, the only undetected transposition errors of adjacent digits  $a$  and  $b$  are those where  $|a - b| = 5$ . To verify this, we observe that a transposition error of the form

$$
a _ {1} a _ {2} \dots a _ {i} a _ {i + 1} \dots a _ {1 2} \rightarrow a _ {1} a _ {2} \dots a _ {i + 1} a _ {i} \dots a _ {1 2}
$$

is undetected if and only if

$$
\left(a _ {1}, a _ {2}, \dots , a _ {i + 1}, a _ {i}, \dots , a _ {1 2}\right) \cdot \left(3, 1, 3, 1, \dots , 3, 1\right) \bmod 1 0 = 0.
$$

That is, the error is undetected if and only if

$$
\begin{array}{l} (a _ {1}, a _ {2}, \dots , a _ {i + 1}, a _ {i}, \dots , a _ {1 2}) \cdot (3, 1, 3, 1, \dots , 3, 1) \mod 1 0 \\ = \left(a _ {1}, a _ {2}, \dots , a _ {i}, a _ {i + 1}, \dots , a _ {1 2}\right) \cdot \left(3, 1, 3, 1, \dots , 3, 1\right) \mod 1 0. \\ \end{array}
$$

This equality simplifies to either

$$
\left(3 a _ {i + 1} + a _ {i}\right) \mod 1 0 = \left(3 a _ {i} + a _ {i + 1}\right) \mod 1 0
$$

or

$$
\left(a _ {i + 1} + 3 a _ {i}\right) \bmod 1 0 = \left(a _ {i} + 3 a _ {i + 1}\right) \bmod 1 0,
$$

depending on whether  $i$  is even or odd. Both cases reduce to  $2(a_{i+1} - a_i) \mod 10 = 0$ . It follows that  $|a_{i+1} - a_i| = 5$ , if  $a_{i+1} \neq a_i$ .

In 2005, United States companies began to phase in the use of a 13th digit to be in conformance with the 13-digit product identification numbers used in Europe. The weighting vector for 13-digit numbers is  $(1,3,1,3,\ldots,3,1)$ .

Identification numbers printed on bank checks (on the bottom left between the two colons) consist of an eight-digit number  $a_1a_2 \cdots a_8$  and a check digit  $a_9$ , so that

$$
(a _ {1}, a _ {2}, \dots , a _ {9}) \cdot (7, 3, 9, 7, 3, 9, 7, 3, 9) \bmod 1 0 = 0.
$$

As is the case for the UPC scheme, this method detects all single-digit errors and all errors involving the transposition of adjacent digits  $a$  and  $b$  except when  $|a - b| = 5$ . But it also detects most errors of the form  $\dots abc \dots \rightarrow \dots cba \dots$ , whereas the UPC method detects no errors of this form.

In Chapter 5, we will examine more sophisticated means of assigning check digits to numbers.

Modular arithmetic is often used to verify the validity of statements about divisibility regarding all positive integers by checking only finitely many cases.

EXAMPLE 7 Consider the statement, "The sum of the cubes of any three consecutive integers is divisible by 9." This statement is equivalent to checking that the equation  $(n^3 + (n + 1)^3 + (n + 2)^3) \mod 9 = 0$  is true for all integers  $n$ . Because of properties of modular arithmetic, to prove this, all we need to do is check the validity of the equation for  $n = 0, 1, \ldots, 8$ . You do the math.

Modular arithmetic is occasionally used to show that certain equations have no rational number solutions.

EXAMPLE 8 We use mod 4 arithmetic to show that there are no integers  $x$  and  $y$  such that  $x^2 - y^2 = 1002$ . To see this, suppose that there are such integers. Then, taking both sides modulo 4, there is an integer solution to  $x^2 - y^2 \mod 4 = 2$ . Note that for any integer  $n$ , if  $n \mod 4 = 0$  or 2, then  $n^2 \mod 4 = 0$  and if  $n \mod 4 = 1$  or 3 mod 4, then  $n^2 \mod 4 = 1$ . But then the only differences of squares of integers modulo 4 are 0, 1, and  $-1 = 3$ , which gives a contradiction.

At the dawn of the 20th century no one would have thought that strings of 0s and 1s added modulo 2 would provide the underpinning for a revolution in business, industry, technology, and science. The next example is an application of mod 2 arithmetic to circuit design. More applications of mod 2 arithmetic are given in later chapters.

EXAMPLE 9 Logic Gates In electronics a logic gate is a device that accepts as inputs two possible states (on or off) and produces one output (on or off). This can be conveniently modeled using 0 and 1 and modulo 2 arithmetic. The AND gate outputs 1 if and only if both inputs are 1; the OR (inclusive or) gate outputs 1 if at least one input is 1; the XOR (exclusive or) outputs 1 if and only if exactly one input is 1; MAJ (majority) takes three inputs and outputs 1 if and only if at least two inputs are 1. These and others can be conveniently modeled as functions using 0 and 1 and modulo 2 arithmetic as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{l} x \text {A N D} y \quad x y \\ x \text {O R} y \quad x + y + x y \\ x \text {X O R} y \quad x + y \\ \operatorname {M A J} (x, y, z) \quad x z + x y + y z. \\ \end{array}
$$

# Complex Numbers

Recall that complex numbers  $\mathbf{C}$  are expressions of the form  $a + b\sqrt{-1}$ , where  $a$  and  $b$  are real numbers. The number  $\sqrt{-1}$  is defined to have the property  $\sqrt{-1^2} = -1$ . It is customary to use  $i$  to denote  $\sqrt{-1}$ . Then,  $i^2 = -1$ . Complex numbers written in the form  $a + bi$  are said to be in standard form. In some instances it is convenient to write a complex number  $a + bi$  in another form. To do this we represent  $a + bi$  as the point  $(a, b)$  in a plane coordinatized by a horizontal axis called the real axis and a vertical  $i$  axis called the imaginary axis. The distance from the point  $a + bi$  to the origin is  $r = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$  and is often denoted by  $|a + bi|$  and called the norm of  $a + bi$ . If we draw the line segment from the origin to  $a + bi$  and denote the angle formed by the line segment and the positive real axis by  $\theta$ , we can write  $a + bi$  as  $r(\cos \theta + i\sin \theta)$ .

This form of  $a + bi$  is called the polar form. An advantage of the polar form is demonstrated in parts 5 and 6 of Theorem 0.4.

# Theorem 0.4 Properties of Complex Numbers

1. Closure under addition:  $(a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (b + d)i$

2. Closure under multiplication:  $(a + bi)(c + di) = (ac) + (ad)i + (bc)i + (bd)i^2 = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i$

3. Closure under division:  $(c + di \neq 0): \frac{(a + bi)}{(c + di)}$

$$
\begin{array}{l} = \frac {(a + b i)}{(c + d i)} \frac {(c - d i)}{(c - d i)} = \frac {(a c + b d) + (b c - a d) i}{c ^ {2} + d ^ {2}} = \frac {(a c + b d)}{c ^ {2} + d ^ {2}} + \\ \frac {(b c - a d)}{c ^ {2} + d ^ {2}} i \\ \end{array}
$$

4. Complex conjugation:  $(a + bi)(a - bi) = a^2 + b^2$  
5. Inverses: For every nonzero complex number  $a + bi$  there is a complex number  $c + di$  such that  $(a + bi)(c + di) = 1$  (i.e.,  $(a + bi)^{-1}$  exists in  $\mathbf{C}$ ).  
6. Powers: For every complex number  $a + bi = r(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta)$  and every positive integer  $n$ , we have  $(a + bi)^n = (r(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta))^n = r^n (\cos n\theta + i \sin n\theta)$ .  
7.  $n^{th}$ -roots of  $a + bi$ : For any positive integer  $n$  the  $n$  distinct  $n^{th}$  roots of  $a + bi = r(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta)$  are  $\sqrt[n]{r} (\cos \frac{\theta + 2\pi k}{n} + i \sin \frac{\theta + 2\pi k}{n})$  for  $k = 0, 1, \ldots, n - 1$ .

PROOF Parts 1 and 2 are definitions. Part 4 follows from part 2. Part 6 is proved in Example 15 in the next section of this chapter. Part 7 follows from part 6.

The next two examples illustrate properties of complex numbers.

EXAMPLE 10  $(3 + 5i) + (-5 + 2i) = -2 + 7i$ ;

$$
\begin{array}{l} (3 + 5 i) (- 5 + 2 i) = - 2 5 + (- 1 9) i = - 2 5 - 1 9 i; \\ \frac {3 + 5 i}{- 2 + 7 i} = \frac {3 + 5 i}{- 2 + 7 i} \frac {- 2 - 7 i}{- 2 - 7 i} = \frac {2 9 - 3 1 i}{5 3} = \frac {2 9}{5 3} + \frac {- 3 1}{5 3} i; \\ (3 + 5 i) (3 - 5 i) = 9 + 2 5 = 3 4; \\ (3 + 5 i) ^ {- 1} = \frac {3}{3 4} - \frac {5}{3 4} i. \\ \end{array}
$$

EXAMPLE 11  $(-1 + i)^{4} = \left(\sqrt{2}\left(\cos \frac{3\pi}{4} +i\sin \frac{3\pi}{4}\right)\right)^{4} =$

$$
\sqrt {2 ^ {4}} \left(\cos \frac {4 \cdot 3 \pi}{4} + i \sin \frac {4 \cdot 3 \pi}{4}\right) = 4 (\cos 3 \pi + i \sin 3 \pi) = - 4.
$$

The three cube roots of  $i = \cos \frac{\pi}{2} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{2}$  are

$$
\begin{array}{l} \cos \frac {\pi}{6} + i \sin \frac {\pi}{6} = \frac {\sqrt {3}}{2} + \frac {1}{2} i \\ \cos \left(\frac {\pi}{6} + \frac {2 \pi}{3}\right) + i \sin \left(\frac {\pi}{6} + \frac {2 \pi}{3}\right) = - \frac {\sqrt {3}}{2} + \frac {1}{2} i \\ \cos \left(\frac {\pi}{6} + \frac {4 \pi}{3}\right) + i \sin \left(\frac {\pi}{6} + \frac {4 \pi}{3}\right) = - i. \\ \end{array}
$$

# Mathematical Induction

There are two forms of proof by mathematical induction that we will use. Both are equivalent to the Well Ordering Principle. The explicit formulation of the method of mathematical induction came in the 16th century. Francisco Maurolico (1494-1575), a teacher of Galileo, used it in 1575 to prove that  $1 + 3 + 5 + \dots + (2n - 1) = n^2$ , and Blaise Pascal (1623-1662) used it when he presented what we now call Pascal's triangle for the coefficients of the binomial expansion. The term mathematical induction was coined by Augustus De Morgan.

# Theorem 0.5 First Principle of Mathematical Induction

Let  $S$  be a set of integers containing  $a$ . Suppose  $S$  has the property that whenever some integer  $n \geq a$  belongs to  $S$ , then the integer  $n + 1$  also belongs to  $S$ . Then,  $S$  contains every integer greater than or equal to  $a$ .

PROOF The proof is left as an exercise (Exercise 33).

So, to use induction to prove that a statement involving positive integers is true for every positive integer, we must first verify that the statement is true for the integer 1. We then assume the statement is true for the integer  $n$  and use this assumption to prove that the statement is true for the integer  $n + 1$ .

Our next example uses some facts about plane geometry. Recall that given a straightedge and compass, we can construct a right angle.

EXAMPLE 12 We use induction to prove that given a straightedge, a compass, and a unit length, we can construct a line segment of length  $\sqrt{n}$  for every positive integer  $n$ . The case when  $n = 1$  is given. Now we assume that we can construct a line segment of length  $\sqrt{n}$ . Then use the straightedge and compass to construct a right triangle with height 1 and base  $\sqrt{n}$ . The hypotenuse of the triangle has length  $\sqrt{n + 1}$ . So, by induction, we can construct a line segment of length  $\sqrt{n}$  for every positive integer  $n$ .

EXAMPLE 13 DeMoivre's Theorem We use induction to prove that for every positive integer  $n$  and every real number  $\theta$ ,  $(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta)^n = \cos n\theta + i \sin n\theta$ , where  $i$  is the complex number  $\sqrt{-1}$ . Obviously, the statement is true for  $n = 1$ . Now assume it is true for  $n$ . We must prove that  $(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta)^{n+1} = \cos (n+1)\theta + i \sin (n+1)\theta$ . Observe that

$$
\begin{array}{l} \left(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta\right) ^ {n + 1} = \left(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta\right) ^ {n} \left(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta\right) \\ = (\cos n \theta + i \sin n \theta) (\cos \theta + i \sin \theta) \\ = \cos n \theta \cos \theta + i (\sin n \theta \cos \theta \\ + \sin \theta \cos n \theta) - \sin n \theta \sin \theta . \\ \end{array}
$$

Now, using trigonometric identities for  $\cos (\alpha +\beta)$  and  $\sin (\alpha +\beta)$ , we see that this last term is  $\cos (n + 1)\theta +i\sin (n + 1)\theta$ . So, by induction, the statement is true for all positive integers.

In many instances, the assumption that a statement is true for an integer  $n$  does not readily lend itself to a proof that the statement is true for the integer  $n + 1$ . In such cases, the following equivalent form of induction may be more convenient. Some authors call this formulation the strong form of induction.

# Theorem 0.6 Second Principle of Mathematical Induction

Let  $S$  be a set of integers containing  $a$ . Suppose  $S$  has the property that  $n$  belongs to  $S$  whenever every integer less than  $n$  and greater than or equal to  $a$  belongs to  $S$ . Then,  $S$  contains every integer greater than or equal to  $a$ .

# PROOF The proof is left to the reader.

To use this form of induction, we first show that the statement is true for the integer  $a$ . We then assume that the statement is true for all integers that are greater than or equal to  $a$  and less than  $n$ , and use this assumption to prove that the statement is true for  $n$ .

EXAMPLE 14 We will use the Second Principle of Mathematical Induction with  $a = 2$  to prove the existence portion of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Let  $S$  be the set of integers greater than 1 that are primes or products of primes. Clearly,  $2 \in S$ . Now we assume that for some integer  $n$ ,  $S$  contains all integers  $k$  with  $2 \leq k < n$ . We must show that  $n \in S$ . If  $n$  is a prime, then  $n \in S$  by definition. If  $n$  is not a prime, then  $n$  can be written in the form  $ab$ , where  $1 < a < n$  and  $1 < b < n$ .

Since we are assuming that both  $a$  and  $b$  belong to  $S$ , we know that each of them is a prime or a product of primes. Thus,  $n$  is also a product of primes. This completes the proof.

Notice that it is more natural to prove the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic with the Second Principle of Mathematical Induction than with the First Principle. Knowing that a particular integer factors as a product of primes does not tell you anything about factoring the next larger integer. (Does knowing that 5280 is a product of primes help you to factor 5281 as a product of primes?)

The following problem appeared in the "Brain Boggler" section of the January 1988 issue of the science magazine *Discovery.*<sup>2</sup> Problems like this one are often called chicken McNugget problems, postage stamp problems, or Frobenius coin problems. Originally, McDonald's sold its chicken nuggets in packs of 9 and 20. The largest number of nuggets that could not have been bought with these packs is 151.

■ EXAMPLE 15 The Quakertown Poker Club plays with blue chips worth  $5.00 and red chips worth$ 8.00. What is the largest bet that cannot be made?

To gain insight into this problem, we try various combinations of blue and red chips and obtain 5, 8, 10, 13, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40. It appears that the answer is 27. But how can we be sure? Well, we need only prove that every integer greater than 27 can be written in the form  $a \cdot 5 + b \cdot 8$ , where  $a$  and  $b$  are nonnegative integers. This will solve the problem, since  $a$  represents the number of blue chips and  $b$  the number of red chips needed to make a bet of  $a \cdot 5 + b \cdot 8$ . For the purpose of contrast, we will give two proofs—one using the First Principle of Mathematical Induction and one using the Second Principle.

Let  $S$  be the set of all integers greater than or equal to 28 of the form  $a \cdot 5 + b \cdot 8$ , where  $a$  and  $b$  are nonnegative. Obviously,  $28 \in S$ . Now assume that some integer  $n \in S$ , say,  $n = a \cdot 5 + b \cdot 8$ . We must show that  $n + 1 \in S$ . First, note that since  $n \geq 28$ , we cannot have both  $a$  and  $b$  less than 3. If  $a \geq 3$ , then

$$
\begin{array}{l} n + 1 = (a \cdot 5 + b \cdot 8) + (- 3 \cdot 5 + 2 \cdot 8) \\ = (a - 3) \cdot 5 + (b + 2) \cdot 8. \\ \end{array}
$$

(Regarding chips, this last equation says that we may increase a bet from  $n$  to  $n + 1$  by removing three blue chips from the pot and adding two red chips.) If  $b \geq 3$ , then

$$
\begin{array}{l} n + 1 = (a \cdot 5 + b \cdot 8) + (5 \cdot 5 - 3 \cdot 8) \\ = (a + 5) \cdot 5 + (b - 3) \cdot 8. \\ \end{array}
$$

(The bet can be increased by 1 by removing three red chips and adding five blue chips.) This completes the proof.

To prove the same statement by the Second Principle, we note that each of the integers 28, 29, 30, 31, and 32 is in  $S$ . Now assume that for some integer  $n > 32$ ,  $S$  contains all integers  $k$  with  $28 \leq k < n$ . We must show that  $n \in S$ . Since  $n - 5 \in S$ , there are nonnegative integers  $a$  and  $b$  such that  $n - 5 = a \cdot 5 + b \cdot 8$ . But then  $n = (a + 1) \cdot 5 + b \cdot 8$ . Thus  $n$  is in  $S$ .

# Equivalence Relations

In mathematics, things that are considered different in one context may be viewed as equivalent in another context. We have already seen one such example. Indeed, the sums  $2 + 1$  and  $4 + 4$  are certainly different in ordinary arithmetic, but are the same under modulo 5 arithmetic. Congruent triangles that are situated differently in the plane are not the same, but they are often considered to be the same in plane geometry. In physics, vectors of the same magnitude and direction can produce different effects—a 10-pound weight placed 2 feet from a fulcrum produces a different effect than a 10-pound weight placed 1 foot from a fulcrum. But in linear algebra, vectors of the same magnitude and direction are considered to be the same. What is needed to make these distinctions precise is an appropriate generalization of the notion of equality; that is, we need a formal mechanism for specifying whether or not two quantities are the same in a given setting. This mechanism is an equivalence relation.

# Definition Equivalence Relation

An equivalence relation on a set  $S$  is a set  $R$  of ordered pairs of elements of  $S$  such that

1.  $(a,a)\in R$  for all  $a\in S$  (reflexive property).  
2.  $(a,b)\in R$  implies  $(b,a)\in R$  (symmetric property).  
3.  $(a,b) \in R$  and  $(b,c) \in R$  imply  $(a,c) \in R$  (transitive property).

When  $R$  is an equivalence relation on a set  $S$ , it is customary to write  $aRb$  instead of  $(a, b) \in R$ . Also, since an equivalence relation is just a generalization of equality, a suggestive symbol such as  $\approx, \equiv$ , or  $\sim$  is usually used to denote the relation. Using this notation, the three conditions for an equivalence relation become  $a \sim a$ ;  $a \sim b$  implies  $b \sim a$ ; and  $a \sim b$  and  $b \sim c$  imply  $a \sim c$ . If  $\sim$  is an equivalence relation on a set  $S$  and  $a \in S$ , then the set  $[a] = \{x \in S \mid x \sim a\}$  is called the equivalence class of  $S$  containing  $a$ .

EXAMPLE 16 Let  $S$  be the set of all triangles in a plane. If  $a, b \in S$ , define  $a \sim b$  if  $a$  and  $b$  are similar—that is, if  $a$  and  $b$  have corresponding angles that are the same. Then  $\sim$  is an equivalence relation on  $S$ .

EXAMPLE 17 Let  $S$  be the set of all polynomials with real coefficients. If  $f, g \in S$ , define  $f \sim g$  if  $f' = g'$ , where  $f'$  is the derivative of  $f$ . Then  $\sim$  is an equivalence relation on  $S$ . Since two polynomials with equal derivatives differ by a constant, we see that for any  $f$  in  $S$ ,  $[f] = \{f + c \mid c \text{ is real}\}$ .

EXAMPLE 18 Let  $S$  be the set of integers and let  $n$  be a positive integer. If  $a, b \in S$ , define  $a \equiv b$  if  $a \mod n = b \mod n$  (i.e., if  $a - b$  is divisible by  $n$ ). Then  $\equiv$  is an equivalence relation on  $S$  and  $[a] = \{a + kn \mid k \in S\}$ . Since this particular relation is important in abstract algebra, we will take the trouble to verify that it is indeed an equivalence relation. Certainly,  $a - a$  is divisible by  $n$ , so that  $a \equiv a$  for all  $a$  in  $S$ . Next, assume that  $a \equiv b$ , say,  $a - b = rn$ . Then,  $b - a = (-r)n$ , and therefore  $b \equiv a$ . Finally, assume that  $a \equiv b$  and  $b \equiv c$ , say,  $a - b = rn$  and  $b - c = sn$ . Then, we have  $a - c = (a - b) + (b - c) = rn + sn = (r + s)n$ , so that  $a \equiv c$ .

EXAMPLE 19 Let  $\equiv$  be as in Example 18 and let  $n = 7$ . Then we have  $16 \equiv 2; 9 \equiv -5$ ; and  $24 \equiv 3$ . Also,  $[1] = \{...$ ,  $-20, -13, -6, 1, 8, 15, \ldots\}$  and  $[4] = \{...$ ,  $-17, -10, -3, 4, 11, 18, \ldots\}$ .

EXAMPLE 20 Let  $S = \{(a, b) \mid a, b \text{ are integers}, b \neq 0\}$ . If  $(a, b), (c, d) \in S$ , define  $(a, b) \approx (c, d)$  if  $ad = bc$ . Then  $\approx$  is an equivalence relation on  $S$ . [The motivation for this example comes from fractions. In fact, the pairs  $(a, b)$  and  $(c, d)$  are equivalent if the fractions  $a / b$  and  $c / d$  are equal.]

To verify that  $\approx$  is an equivalence relation on  $S$ , note that  $(a, b) \approx (a, b)$  requires that  $ab = ba$ , which is true. Next, we assume that  $(a, b) \approx (c, d)$ , so that  $ad = bc$ . We have  $(c, d) \approx (a, b)$  provided that  $cb = da$ , which is true from commutativity of multiplication. Finally, we assume that  $(a, b) \approx (c, d)$  and  $(c, d) \approx (e, f)$  and prove that  $(a, b) \approx (e, f)$ . This amounts to using  $ad = bc$

and  $cf = de$  to show that  $af = be$ . Multiplying both sides of  $ad = bc$  by  $f$  and replacing  $cf$  by  $de$ , we obtain  $ADF = bcf = bde$ . Since  $d \neq 0$ , we can cancel  $d$  from the first and last terms.

# Definition Partition

A partition of a set  $S$  is a collection of nonempty disjoint subsets of  $S$  whose union is  $S$ .

Figure 0.3 illustrates a partition of a set into four subsets.

EXAMPLE 21 The sets  $\{0\}, \{1, 2, 3, \ldots\}$ , and  $\{\dots, -3, -2, -1\}$  constitute a partition of the set of integers.  
EXAMPLE 22 The set of nonnegative integers and the set of nonpositive integers do not partition the integers, since both contain 0.

The next theorem reveals that equivalence relations and partitions are intimately intertwined.

# Theorem 0.7 Equivalence Classes Partition

The equivalence classes of an equivalence relation on a set  $S$  constitute a partition of  $S$ . Conversely, for any partition  $P$  of  $S$ , there is an equivalence relation on  $S$  whose equivalence classes are the elements of  $P$ .

PROOF Let  $\sim$  be an equivalence relation on a set  $S$ . For any  $a \in S$ , the reflexive property shows that  $a \in [a]$ . So,  $[a]$  is nonempty and the union of all equivalence classes is  $S$ . Now, suppose that  $[a]$  and  $[b]$  are distinct equivalence classes. We must show that  $[a] \cap [b] = \emptyset$ . On the contrary, assume  $c \in [a] \cap [b]$ . We will show that  $[a] \subseteq [b]$ . To this end, let  $x \in [a]$ . We then have  $c \sim a, c \sim b$ , and  $x \sim a$ . By the symmetric property, we also have  $a \sim c$ . Thus, by transitivity,  $x \sim c$ , and by transitivity again,  $x \sim b$ . This proves  $[a] \subseteq [b]$ . Analogously,  $[b] \subseteq [a]$ . Thus,  $[a] = [b]$ , in contradiction to our assumption that  $[a]$  and  $[b]$  are distinct equivalence classes.

To prove the converse, let  $P$  be a collection of nonempty disjoint subsets of  $S$  whose union is  $S$ . Define  $a \sim b$  if  $a$  and  $b$  belong to the same subset

in the collection. We leave it to the reader to show that  $\sim$  is an equivalence relation on  $S$  (Exercise 51).

# Functions (Mappings)

Although the concept of a function plays a central role in nearly every branch of mathematics, the terminology and notation associated with functions vary quite a bit. In this section, we establish ours.

# Definitions Function (Mapping)

A function (or mapping)  $\phi$  from a set  $A$  to a set  $B$  is a rule that assigns to each element  $a$  of  $A$  exactly one element  $b$  of  $B$ . The set  $A$  is called the domain of  $\phi$ , and  $B$  is called the range of  $\phi$ . If  $\phi$  assigns  $b$  to  $a$ , then  $b$  is called the image of  $a$  under  $\phi$ . The subset of  $B$  comprising all the images of elements of  $A$  is called the image of  $A$  under  $\phi$ .

We use the shorthand  $\phi : A \to B$  to mean that  $\phi$  is a mapping from  $A$  to  $B$ . We will write  $\phi(a) = b$  or  $\phi : a \to b$  to indicate that  $\phi$  carries  $a$  to  $b$ .

There are often different ways to denote the same element of a set. In defining a function in such cases one must verify that the function values assigned to the elements depend not on the way the elements are expressed but on only the elements themselves. For example, the correspondence  $\phi$  from the rational numbers to the integers given by  $\phi(a/b) = a + b$  does not define a function since  $1/2 = 2/4$ , but  $\phi(1/2) \neq \phi(2/4)$ . To verify that a correspondence is a function, you assume that  $x_1 = x_2$  and prove that  $\phi(x_1) = \phi(x_2)$ .

# Definition Composition of Functions

Let  $\phi : A \to B$  and  $\psi : B \to C$ . The composition  $\psi \phi$  is the mapping from  $A$  to  $C$  defined by  $(\psi \phi)(a) = \psi(\phi(a))$  for all  $a$  in  $A$ .

In calculus courses, the composition of  $f$  with  $g$  is written  $(f \circ g)(x)$  and is defined by  $(f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x))$ . When we compose functions, we omit the "circle."

EXAMPLE 23 Let  $f(x) = 2x + 3$  and  $g(x) = x^2 + 1$ . Then  $(fg)(5) = f(g(5)) = f(26) = 55$ ;  $(gf)(5) = g(f(5)) = g(13) = 170$ . More generally,  $(fg)(x) = f(g(x)) = f(x^2 + 1) = 2(x^2 + 1) + 3 = 2x^2 + 5$  and  $(gf)(x) = g(f(x)) = g(2x + 3) = (2x + 3)^2 + 1 = 4x^2 + 12x + 9 + 1 = 4x^2 + 12x + 10$ . Note that the function  $fg$  is not the same as the function  $gf$ .

There are several kinds of functions that occur often enough to be given names.

# Definition One-to-One Function

A function  $\phi$  from a set  $A$  is called one-to-one if for every  $a_1, a_2 \in A$ ,  $\phi(a_1) = \phi(a_2)$  implies  $a_1 = a_2$ .

The term one-to-one is suggestive, since the definition ensures that one element of  $B$  can be the image of only one element of  $A$ . Alternatively,  $\phi$  is one-to-one if  $a_1 \neq a_2$  implies  $\phi(a_1) \neq \phi(a_2)$ . That is, different elements of  $A$  map to different elements of  $B$ . See Figure 0.4.

$\psi$  is not one-to-one

# Definition Function from A onto B

A function  $\phi$  from a set  $A$  to a set  $B$  is said to be onto  $B$  if each element of  $B$  is the image of at least one element of  $A$ . In symbols,  $\phi : A \to B$  is onto if for each  $b$  in  $B$  there is at least one  $a$  in  $A$  such that  $\phi(a) = b$ . See Figure 0.5.

![](images/f42e584e3502f88d6e4ad9dfc1aae6ab97f15e12f674a0b13359569a9160a317.jpg)

The next theorem summarizes the facts about functions we will need.

# Theorem 0.8 Properties of Functions

Given functions  $\alpha : A \to B, \beta : B \to C$ , and  $\gamma : C \to D$ , then

1.  $\gamma (\beta \alpha) = (\gamma \beta)\alpha$  (associativity).  
2. If  $\alpha$  and  $\beta$  are one-to-one, then  $\beta \alpha$  is one-to-one.  
3. If  $\alpha$  and  $\beta$  are onto, then  $\beta \alpha$  is onto.  
4. If  $\alpha$  is one-to-one and onto, then there is a function  $\alpha^{-1}$  from  $B$  onto  $A$  such that  $(\alpha^{-1}\alpha)(a) = a$  for all  $a$  in  $A$  and  $(\alpha \alpha^{-1})(b) = b$  for all  $b$  in  $B$ .

PROOF We prove only part 1. The remaining parts are left as exercises (Exercise 55). Let  $a \in A$ . Then  $(\gamma(\beta\alpha))(a) = \gamma((\beta\alpha)(a)) = \gamma(\beta(\alpha(a)))$ . On the other hand,  $((\gamma\beta)\alpha)(a) = (\gamma\beta)(\alpha(a)) = \gamma(\beta(\alpha(a)))$ . So,  $\gamma(\beta\alpha) = (\gamma\beta)\alpha$ .

It is useful to note that if  $\alpha$  is one-to-one and onto, the function  $\alpha^{-1}$  described in part 4 of Theorem 0.8 has the property that if  $\alpha(s) = t$ , then  $\alpha^{-1}(t) = s$ . That is, the image of  $t$  under  $\alpha^{-1}$  is the unique element  $s$  that maps to  $t$  under  $\alpha$ . In effect,  $\alpha^{-1}$  "undoes" what  $\alpha$  does.

EXAMPLE 24 Let  $\mathbf{Z}$  denote the set of integers,  $\mathbf{R}$  the set of real numbers, and  $\mathbf{N}$  the set of nonnegative integers. The following table illustrates the properties of one-to-one and onto.

<table><tr><td>Domain</td><td>Range</td><td>Rule</td><td>One-to-One</td><td>Onto</td></tr><tr><td>Z</td><td>Z</td><td>x → x3</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>R</td><td>R</td><td>x → x3</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Z</td><td>N</td><td>x → |x|</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Z</td><td>Z</td><td>x → x2</td><td>No</td><td>No</td></tr></table>

To verify that  $x \to x^3$  is one-to-one in the first two cases, notice that if  $x^3 = y^3$ , we may take the cube roots of both sides of the equation to obtain  $x = y$ . Clearly, the mapping from  $\mathbf{Z}$  to  $\mathbf{Z}$  given by  $x \to x^3$  is not onto, since 2 is the cube of no integer. However,  $x \to x^3$  defines an onto function from  $\mathbf{R}$  to  $\mathbf{R}$ , since every real number is the cube of its cube root (i.e.,  $\sqrt[3]{b} \to b$ ). The remaining verifications are left to the reader.

# 1 Introduction to Groups

And symmetry is a powerful guiding principle that has been used in creating these models [for quantum physics]. The more symmetrical a model is, the easier it is to analyze.

Edward Frenkel, Love and Math

Symmetry is a vast subject, significant in art and nature. Mathematics lies at its root, and it would be hard to find a better one on which to demonstrate the working of the mathematical intellect.

Hermann Weyl, Symmetry

# Symmetries of a Square

Suppose we remove a square region from a plane, move it in some way, then put the square back into the space it originally occupied. Our goal in this chapter is to describe all possible ways in which this can be done. More specifically, we want to describe the possible relationships between the starting position of the square and its final position in terms of motions. However, we are interested in the net effect of a motion, rather than in the motion itself. Thus, for example, we consider a  $90^{\circ}$  rotation and a  $450^{\circ}$  rotation as equal, since they have the same net effect on every point. With this simplifying convention, it is an easy matter to achieve our goal.

To begin, we can think of the square region as being transparent (glass, say), with the corners marked on one side with the colors blue, white, pink, and green. This makes it easy to distinguish between motions that have different effects. With this marking scheme, we are now in a position to describe, in simple fashion, all possible ways in which a square object can be repositioned. See Figure 1.1. We now claim that any motion—no matter how complicated—is equivalent to one of these eight. To verify this claim, observe that the final position of the square is completely determined by the location and orientation (i.e., face up or face down) of any particular corner. But, clearly, there are only four locations and two orientations for a given corner, so there are exactly eight distinct final positions for the corner.

Let's investigate some consequences of the fact that every motion is equal to one of the eight listed in Figure 1.1. Suppose a square is repositioned by a rotation of  $90^{\circ}$  followed by a flip about the horizontal axis of symmetry.

$$
R _ {0} = \text {R o t a t i o n} 0 ^ {\circ} (\text {n o c h a n g e i n p o s i t i o n})
$$

$$
R _ {9 0} = \text {R o t a t i o n} 9 0 ^ {\circ} (\text {c o u n t e r c l o w k w i s e})
$$

$$
R _ {1 8 0} = \text {R o t a t i o n} 1 8 0 ^ {\circ}
$$

$$
R _ {2 7 0} = \text {R o t a t i o n} 2 7 0 ^ {\circ}
$$

$$
H = \text {F l i p a b o u t a h o r i z o n t a l a x i s}
$$

$$
V = \text {F l i p a b o u t a v e r t i c a l a x i s}
$$

$$
D = \text {F l i p}
$$

$$
D ^ {\prime} = \text {F l i p a b o u t t h e o t h e r d i a g o n a l}

Figure 1.1 Symmetries of a square.

Thus, we see that this pair of motions—taken together—is equal to the single motion  $D$ . This observation suggests that we can compose two motions to obtain a single motion. And indeed we can, since the eight motions may be viewed as functions from the square region to itself, and as such we can combine them using function composition.

With this in mind, we write  $HR_{90} = D$  because in lower-level math courses function composition  $f \circ g$  means "  $g$  followed by  $f$ ". The eight motions  $R_0, R_{90}, R_{180}, R_{270}, H, V, D,$  and  $D'$ , together with the operation composition, form a mathematical system called the dihedral group of order 8 (the order of a group is the number of elements it contains). It is denoted by  $D_4$ . Rather than introduce the formal definition of a group here, let's look at some properties of groups by way of the example  $D_4$ .

To facilitate future computations, we construct an operation table, the Cayley table (so named in honor of the prolific English mathematician Arthur Cayley, who first introduced them in 1854) for  $D_4$  below. The circled entry represents the fact that  $D = HR_{90}$ . (In general,  $ab$  denotes the entry at the intersection of the row with  $a$  at the left and the column with  $b$  at the top.)

Notice how orderly this table looks! This is no accident. Perhaps the most important feature of this table is that it has been completely filled in without introducing any new motions. Of course, this is because, as we have already pointed out, any sequence of motions turns out to be the same as one of these eight. Algebraically, this says that if  $A$  and  $B$  are in  $D_4$ , then so is  $AB$ . This property is called closure, and it is one of the requirements for a mathematical system to be a group. Next, notice that if  $A$  is any element of  $D_4$ , then  $AR_0 = R_0A = A$ . Thus, combining any element  $A$  on either side with  $R_0$  yields  $A$  back again. An element  $R_0$  with this property is called an identity, and every group must have one. Moreover, we see that for each element  $A$  in  $D_4$ , there is exactly one element  $B$  in  $D_4$  such that  $AB = BA = R_0$ . In this case,  $B$  is said to be the inverse of  $A$  and vice versa. For example,  $R_{90}$  and  $R_{270}$  are inverses of each other, and  $H$  is its own inverse. The term inverse is a descriptive one, for if  $A$  and  $B$  are inverses of each other, then  $B$  "undoes" whatever  $A$  "does," in the sense that  $A$  and  $B$  taken together in either order produce  $R_0$ , representing no change. Another striking feature of the table is that every element of  $D_4$  appears exactly once in each row and column. This feature is something that all groups must have, and, indeed, it is quite useful to keep this fact in mind when constructing the table in the first place.

Another property of  $D_4$  deserves special comment. Observe that  $HD \neq DH$  but  $R_{90}R_{180} = R_{180}R_{90}$ . Thus, in a group,  $ab$  may or may not be the same as  $ba$ . If it happens that  $ab = ba$  for all choices of group elements  $a$  and  $b$ , we say the group is commutative or—better yet—Abelian (in honor of the great Norwegian mathematician Niels Abel). Otherwise, we say the group is non-Abelian.

Thus far, we have illustrated, by way of  $D_4$ , three of the four conditions that define a group—namely, closure, existence of an identity, and existence of inverses. The remaining condition required for a group is associativity; that is,  $(ab)c = a(bc)$  for all  $a, b, c$  in the set. To be sure that  $D_4$  is indeed a group, we should check this equation for each of the  $8^3 = 512$  possible choices of  $a, b,$  and  $c$  in  $D_4$ . In practice, however, this is rarely done! Here, for example, we simply observe that the eight motions are functions and the operation is function composition. Then, since function composition is associative, we do not have to check the equations.

# The Dihedral Groups

The analysis carried out above for a square can similarly be done for an equilateral triangle or regular pentagon or, indeed, any regular  $n$ -gon ( $n \geq 3$ ). The corresponding group is denoted by  $D_{n}$  and is called the dihedral group of order  $2n$ .

The dihedral groups arise frequently in art and nature. Many of the decorative designs used on floor coverings, pottery, and buildings have one of the dihedral groups as a group of symmetry. Corporation logos are rich sources of dihedral symmetry. Chrysler's logo has  $D_{5}$  as a symmetry group, and that of Mercedes-Benz has  $D_{3}$ . The ubiquitous five-pointed star has symmetry group  $D_{5}$ . The phylum Echinodermata contains many sea animals (such as starfish, sea cucumbers, feather stars, and sand dollars) that exhibit patterns with  $D_{5}$  symmetry. Snowflakes have  $D_{6}$  symmetry (see Exercise 19).

Chemists classify molecules according to their symmetry. Moreover, symmetry considerations are applied in orbital calculations, in determining energy levels of atoms and molecules, and in the study of molecular vibrations. The symmetry group of a pyramidal molecule such as ammonia  $\mathrm{(NH_3)}$ , depicted in Figure 1.2, is  $D_{3}$ .

Mineralogists determine the internal structures of crystals (i.e., rigid bodies in which the particles are arranged in three-dimensional discrete patterns—table salt and table sugar are two examples) by studying two-dimensional x-ray projections of the atomic makeup of the crystals. The symmetry present in the projections reveals the internal symmetry of the crystals themselves. Commonly occurring symmetry patterns are  $D_4$  and  $D_6$  (see Figure 1.3). Interestingly, it is mathematically impossible for a crystal to possess a  $D_n$  repeating symmetry pattern with  $n = 5$  or  $n > 6$ .

The dihedral group of order  $2n$  is often called the group of symmetries of a regular  $n$ -gon. A plane symmetry of a figure  $F$  in a plane is a function from the plane to itself that carries  $F$  onto  $F$  and preserves distances; that is, for any points  $p$  and  $q$  in the plane, the distance from the image of  $p$  to the image of  $q$  is the same as the distance from  $p$  to  $q$ . (The term symmetry is from the Greek word symmetros, meaning "of like measure.") The symmetry group of a plane figure is the set of all symmetries of the figure.

Symmetries in three dimensions are defined analogously. Obviously, a rotation of a plane about a point in the plane is a symmetry of the plane, and a rotation about a line in three dimensions is a symmetry in three-dimensional space. Similarly, any translation of a plane or of three-dimensional space is a symmetry. A reflection across a line  $L$  is that function which leaves every point of  $L$  fixed and takes any point  $Q$ , not on  $L$ , to the point  $Q'$  so that  $L$  is the perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining  $Q$  and  $Q'$  (see Figure 1.4). Figure 1.4 illustrates the characteristic that distinguishes a reflection from a rotation. The reflected image of a clockwise spiral is a counterclockwise spiral and vice versa. In particular, rotations preserve orientation and reflections reverse orientation. We will use this fact often. Also note that reflections reverse handedness, which is an important fact in chemistry.

A reflection across a plane in three dimensions is defined analogously. Notice that the restriction of a  $180^{\circ}$  rotation about a line  $L$  in three dimensions to a plane containing  $L$  is a reflection across  $L$  in the plane. Thus, in the dihedral groups, the motions that we described as flips about axes of symmetry in three dimensions (e.g.,  $H$ ,  $V$ ,  $D$ ,  $D'$ ) are reflections across lines in two dimensions. Just as a reflection across a line is a plane symmetry that cannot be achieved by a physical motion of the plane in two dimensions, a reflection across a plane is a three-dimensional symmetry that cannot be achieved by a physical motion of three-dimensional space. A cup, for instance, has reflective symmetry across the plane bisecting the cup, but this symmetry cannot be duplicated with a physical motion in three dimensions.

Many objects and figures have rotational symmetry but not reflective symmetry. A symmetry group consisting of the rotational symmetries of  $0^{\circ}$ ,  $360^{\circ} / n$ ,  $2(360^{\circ}) / n, \ldots$ ,  $(n - 1)360^{\circ} / n$ , and no other symmetries, is called a cyclic rotation group of order  $n$  and is denoted by  $\langle R_{360 / n} \rangle$ . Cyclic rotation groups, along with dihedral groups, are favorites of artists, designers, and nature. Figure 1.5 illustrates with corporate logos the cyclic rotation groups of orders 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 16, and 20.

A study of symmetry in greater depth is given in Chapter 26.

# Niels Abel

He [Abel] has left mathematicians something to keep them busy for five hundred years.

CHARLES HERMITE

A 500-kroner bank note first issued by Norway in 1948.

NIELS HENRIK ABEL, one of the foremost mathematicians of the 19th century, was born in Norway on August 5, 1802. At the age of 16, he began reading the classic mathematical works of Newton, Euler, Lagrange, and Gauss. When Abel was 18 years old, his father died, and the burden of supporting the family fell upon him. He took in private pupils and did odd jobs, while continuing to do mathematical research. At the age of 19, Abel solved a problem that had vexed leading mathematicians for hundreds of years. He proved that, unlike the situation for equations of

degree 4 or less, there is no finite (closed) formula for the solution of the general fifth-degree equation. Although Abel died long before the advent of the subjects that now make up abstract algebra, his solution to the quintic problem laid the groundwork for many of these subjects. Just when his work was beginning to receive the attention it deserved, Abel contracted tuberculosis. He died on April 6, 1829, at the age of 26.

In recognition of the fact that there is no Nobel Prize for mathematics, in 2002 Norway established the Abel Prize as the "Nobel Prize in mathematics" in honor of its native son. At approximately the $1,000,000 level, the Abel Prize is now seen as an award equivalent to a Nobel Prize.

Abel prize winners John Thompson and Andrew Wiles are profiled in this book.

# Groups

Whenever groups disclose themselves, or could be introduced, simplicity crystallized out of comparative chaos.

E. T. Bell, Mathematics: Queen and Servant of Science

The world of groups is immense: There are groups of matrices (arrays of numbers) and groups of symmetry transformations, groups that keep track of the number of holes inside a shape or the different arrangements of a deck of cards, and groups that arise in physics and cryptography and a host of other domains.

Erica Klarreich

# Definition and Examples of Groups

The term group was used by Galois around 1830 to describe sets of one-to-one functions on finite sets that could be grouped together to form a set closed under composition. As is the case with most fundamental concepts in mathematics, the modern definition of a group that follows is the result of a long evolutionary process. Although this definition was given by both Heinrich Weber and Walther von Dyck in 1882, it did not gain universal acceptance until the 20th century.

# Definition Binary Operation

Let  $G$  be a set. A binary operation on  $G$  is a function that assigns each ordered pair of elements of  $G$  an element of  $G$ .

A binary operation on a set  $G$ , then, is simply a method (or formula) by which the members of an ordered pair from  $G$  combine to yield a new member of  $G$ . This condition is called closure. The most familiar binary operations are ordinary addition, subtraction, and multiplication of integers. Division of integers is not a binary operation on the integers because an integer divided by an integer need not be an integer.

The binary operations addition modulo  $n$  and multiplication modulo  $n$  on the set  $\{0, 1, 2, \ldots, n - 1\}$ , which we denote by  $Z_{n}$ , play an extremely important role in abstract algebra. In certain situations we will want to combine the elements of  $Z_{n}$  by addition modulo  $n$  only; in other situations we will want to use both addition modulo  $n$  and multiplication modulo  $n$  to combine the elements. It will be clear from the context whether we are using addition only or addition and multiplication. For example, when multiplying matrices

with entries from  $Z_{n}$ , we will need both addition modulo  $n$  and multiplication modulo  $n$ .

# Definition Group

Let  $G$  be a set together with a binary operation (usually called multiplication) that assigns to each ordered pair  $(a, b)$  of elements of  $G$  an element in  $G$  denoted by  $ab$ . We say  $G$  is a group under this operation if the following three properties are satisfied.

1. Associativity. The operation is associative; that is,  $(ab)c = a(bc)$  for all  $a, b, c$  in  $G$ .  
2. Identity. There is an element  $e$  (called the identity) in  $G$  such that  $ae = ea = a$  for all  $a$  in  $G$ .  
3. Inverses. For each element  $a$  in  $G$ , there is an element  $b$  in  $G$  (called an inverse of  $a$ ) such that  $ab = ba = e$ .

In words, then, a group is a set together with an associative operation such that there is an identity, every element has an inverse, and any pair of elements can be combined without going outside the set. Be sure to verify closure when testing for a group (see Example 5). Notice that if  $a$  is the inverse of  $b$ , then  $b$  is the inverse of  $a$ .

If a group has the property that  $ab = ba$  for every pair of elements  $a$  and  $b$ , we say the group is Abelian. A group is non-Abelian if there is some pair of elements  $a$  and  $b$  for which  $ab \neq ba$ . When encountering a particular group for the first time, one should determine whether or not it is Abelian.

Now that we have the formal definition of a group, our first keystone in learning about them is to build a good stock of examples. These examples will be used throughout the text to illustrate the theorems. (The best way to grasp the meat of a theorem is to see what it says in specific cases.) As we progress, the reader is bound to have hunches and conjectures that can be tested against the stock of examples. To develop a better understanding of the following examples, the reader should supply the missing details.

EXAMPLE 1 The set of integers  $Z$  (so denoted because the German word for numbers is Zahlen), the set of rational numbers  $Q$  (for quotient), and the set of real numbers  $\mathbf{R}$  are all groups under ordinary addition. In each case, the identity is 0 and the inverse of  $a$  is  $-a$ .  
EXAMPLE 2 The set of integers under ordinary multiplication is not a group. Since the number 1 is the identity, property 3 fails. For example, there is no integer  $b$  such that  $5b = 1$ .  
EXAMPLE 3 The subset  $\{1, -1, i, -i\}$  of the complex numbers is a group under complex multiplication. Note that  $-1$  is its own inverse, whereas the inverse of  $i$  is  $-i$ , and vice versa.  
EXAMPLE 4 The set  $Q^{+}$  of positive rationals is a group under ordinary multiplication. The inverse of any  $a$  is  $1 / a = a^{-1}$ .

EXAMPLE 5 The set  $S$  of positive irrational numbers together with 1 under multiplication satisfies the three properties given in the definition of a group but is not a group. Indeed,  $\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2} = 2$ , so  $S$  is not closed under multiplication.

EXAMPLE 6 A rectangular array of the form  $\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix}$  is called a  $2 \times 2$  matrix. The set of all  $2 \times 2$  matrices with real entries is a group under componentwise addition. That is,

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{c c} a _ {1} & b _ {1} \\ c _ {1} & d _ {1} \end{array} \right] + \left[ \begin{array}{c c} a _ {2} & b _ {2} \\ c _ {2} & d _ {2} \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c c} a _ {1} + a _ {2} & b _ {1} + b _ {2} \\ c _ {1} + c _ {2} & d _ {1} + d _ {2} \end{array} \right]
$$

The identity is  $\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ , and the inverse of  $\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix}$  is  $\begin{bmatrix} -a & -b \\ -c & -d \end{bmatrix}$ .

EXAMPLE 7 The set  $Z_{n} = \{0,1,\dots ,n - 1\}$  for  $n\geq 1$  is a group under addition modulo  $n$ . For any  $j > 0$  in  $Z_{n}$ , the inverse of  $j$  is  $n - j$ . This group is usually referred to as the group of integers modulo  $n$ .

As we have seen, the real numbers, the  $2 \times 2$  matrices with real entries, and the integers modulo  $n$  are all groups under the appropriate addition. But what about multiplication? In each case, the existence of some elements that do not have inverses prevents the set from being a group under the usual multiplication. However, we can form a group in each case by simply throwing out the rascals. Examples 8, 9, and 11 illustrate this.

EXAMPLE 8 The set  $\mathbf{R}^*$  of nonzero real numbers is a group under ordinary multiplication. The identity is 1. The inverse of  $a$  is  $1 / a$ .

EXAMPLE 9 The determinant of the  $2 \times 2$  matrix  $\left[ \begin{array}{cc}a & b\\ c & d \end{array} \right]$  is the number  $ad - bc$ . If  $A$  is a  $2 \times 2$  matrix,  $\det A$  denotes the determinant of  $A$ . The set

$$
G L (2, \mathbf {R}) = \left\{\left[ \begin{array}{c c} a & b \\ c & d \end{array} \right] \Big | a, b, c, d \in \mathbf {R}, a d - b c \neq 0 \right\}
$$

of  $2 \times 2$  matrices with real entries and nonzero determinants is a non-Abelian group under the operation

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{c c} a _ {1} & b _ {1} \\ c _ {1} & d _ {1} \end{array} \right] \left[ \begin{array}{c c} a _ {2} & b _ {2} \\ c _ {2} & d _ {2} \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c c} a _ {1} a _ {2} + b _ {1} c _ {2} & a _ {1} b _ {2} + b _ {1} d _ {2} \\ c _ {1} a _ {2} + d _ {1} c _ {2} & c _ {1} b _ {2} + d _ {1} d _ {2} \end{array} \right].
$$

The first step in verifying that this set is a group is to show that the product of two matrices with nonzero determinants also has a nonzero determinant. This follows from the fact that for any pair of  $2 \times 2$  matrices  $A$  and  $B$ ,  $\det(AB) = (\det A)(\det B)$ .

Associativity can be verified by direct (but cumbersome) calculations. The identity is  $\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$ ; the inverse of  $\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix}$  is

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{c c} d & - b \\ \hline a d - b c & \overline {{a d - b c}} \\ \hline - c & a \\ \hline a d - b c & \overline {{a d - b c}} \end{array} \right]
$$

(explaining the requirement in the definition of  $GL(2, \mathbf{R})$  that  $ad - bc \neq 0$ ). In particular, the determinant of a matrix determines if it has an inverse. Another useful fact about determinants is  $\det A^{-1} = (\det A)^{-1}$ .

This very important non-Abelian group is called the general linear group of  $2 \times 2$  matrices over  $\mathbf{R}$ .

EXAMPLE 10 The set of all  $2 \times 2$  matrices with real entries is not a group under the operation defined in Example 9. Inverses do not exist when the determinant is 0.

In Chapter 1 we introduced the dihedral groups by designating the four reflections in  $D_4$  with the intuitive notions of horizontal, vertical and diagonals axes and used a Cayley table to perform multiplication. For integers greater than 4 there is no natural analog for describing the reflections and a Cayley table is too cumbersome. Moreover, performing operations on regular  $n$ -gon for large  $n$  is impractical. The following example demonstrates properties of the dihedral groups that allows us to algebraically describe all dihedral groups and perform multiplication in a simple way.

EXAMPLE 11 Algebraic approach to the dihedral groups

In  $D_{n}$  let  $R$  denote  $R_{360 / n}$  and let  $F$  be any reflection. Then

$$
D _ {n} = \left\{R _ {0}, R, R ^ {2}, \dots , R ^ {n - 1}, F, R F, R ^ {2} F, \dots , R ^ {n - 1} F \right\}.
$$

To do the multiplication observe that because every reflection is its own inverse we know  $FF = R_0$  and  $R^i FR^i F = R_0$ . Rearranging we have  $R^i F = F^{-1}R^{-i} = FR^{-i}$ . This tells us that we can always "switch"  $R^i$  and  $F$  provided we change the sign of the exponent of  $R$ . In particular, this relationship serves as a commutativity-like property that allows us to rearrange the product of rotations and reflections. For instance, if  $n = 10$ , we have  $R^{10} = R_0$  and  $R^3 FR^7 F = R^3 FFR^{-7} = R^3 R^{-7} = R^{-4} = R^6$ ;  $FR^4 = R^{-4}F = R^6 F$ ; and  $FR^{-3}F = R^3 FF = R^3$ .

For real numbers  $a$  and  $b$  with  $a \neq 0$  the equation  $ax = b$  has the unique solution  $x = a^{-1}b$ . In contrast, for  $a$  and  $b$  with  $a \neq b$  in  $Z_{n}$  the equation  $ax = b$  can have no solution, a unique solution, or multiple solutions. The next example shows that elements  $a$  in  $Z_{n}$  for which  $ax = 1$  have special significance.

EXAMPLE 12 (L. EULER, 1761) By Exercise 13 in Chapter 0, an integer  $a$  has a multiplicative inverse modulo  $n$  if and only if  $a$  and  $n$  are relatively prime. So, for any positive integer  $n$ , we define  $U(n)$  to be the set of all positive integers less than  $n$  and relatively prime to  $n$ . Then  $U(n)$  is a group under multiplication modulo  $n$ . (We leave it to the reader to check that this set is closed under this operation.)

For  $n = 10$ , we have  $U(10) = \{1,3,7,9\}$ . The Cayley table for  $U(10)$  is

<table><tr><td>mod 10</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>7</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>7</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>9</td><td>1</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>7</td><td>1</td><td>9</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>9</td><td>7</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr></table>

(Recall that  $ab$  mod  $n$  is the unique integer  $r$  with the property  $a \cdot b = nq + r$ , where  $0 \leq r < n$  and  $a \cdot b$  is ordinary multiplication.) In the case that  $n$  is a prime,  $U(n) = \{1, 2, \ldots, n - 1\}$ .

In his classic book *Lehrbuch der Algebra*, published in 1895, Heinrich Weber gave an extensive treatment of the groups  $U(n)$  and described them as the most important examples of finite Abelian groups.

EXAMPLE 13 The set  $\{0, 1, 2, 3\}$  is not a group under multiplication modulo 4. Although 1 and 3 have inverses, the elements 0 and 2 do not.

EXAMPLE 14 The set of integers under subtraction is not a group, since the operation is not associative.

With the examples given thus far as a guide, it is wise for the reader to pause here and think of his or her own examples. Study actively! Don't just read along and be spoon-fed by the book.

EXAMPLE 15 The complex numbers  $\mathbf{C} = \{a + bi \mid a, b \in \mathbf{R}, i^2 = -1\}$  are a group under the operation  $(a + bi) + (c + di) = (a + c) + (b + d)i$ . The inverse of  $a + bi$  is  $-a - bi$ . The nonzero complex numbers  $\mathbf{C}^*$  are a group under the operation  $(a + bi)(c + di) = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i$ . The inverse of

$$
a + b i \text {i s} \frac {1}{a + b i} = \frac {1}{a + b i} \frac {a - b i}{a - b i} = \frac {1}{a ^ {2} + b ^ {2}} a - \frac {1}{a ^ {2} + b ^ {2}} b i.
$$

EXAMPLE 16 For all integers  $n \geq 1$ , the set of complex  $n$ th roots of unity

$$
\left\{\cos \frac {k \cdot 3 6 0 ^ {\circ}}{n} + i \sin \frac {k \cdot 3 6 0 ^ {\circ}}{n} \Big | k = 0, 1, 2, \dots , n - 1 \right\}
$$

(i.e., complex zeros of  $x^n - 1$ ) is a group under multiplication. (See DeMoivre's Theorem—Example 13 in Chapter 0.) Compare this group with the one in Example 3.

Recall from Chapter 0 that the complex number  $\cos \theta + i\sin \theta$  can be represented geometrically as the point  $(\cos \theta, \sin \theta)$  in a plane coordinatized by a real horizontal axis and a vertical imaginary axis, where  $\theta$  is the angle formed by the line segment joining the origin and the point  $(\cos \theta, \sin \theta)$  and the positive real axis. Thus, the six complex zeros of  $x^6 = 1$  are located at points around the circle of radius  $1$ ,  $60^\circ$  apart, as shown in Figure 2.1.

EXAMPLE 17 The set  $\mathbf{R}^n = \{(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n) | a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \in \mathbf{R}\}$  is a group under componentwise addition [i.e.,  $(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n) + (b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n) = (a_1 + b_1, a_2 + b_2, \ldots, a_n + b_n)]$ .

EXAMPLE 18 The set of all  $2 \times 2$  matrices with determinant 1 with entries from  $Q$  (rationals),  $\mathbf{R}$  (reals),  $\mathbf{C}$  (complex numbers), or  $Z_p$  ( $p$  a prime) is

a non-Abelian group under matrix multiplication. This group is called the special linear group of  $2 \times 2$  matrices over  $Q, \mathbf{R}, \mathbf{C}$ , or  $Z_p$ , respectively. If the entries are from  $F$ , where  $F$  is any of the above, we denote this group by  $SL(2, F)$ . For the group  $SL(2, F)$ , the formula given in Example 9 for the inverse of  $\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix}$  simplifies to  $\begin{bmatrix} d & -b \\ -c & a \end{bmatrix}$ . When the matrix entries are from  $Z_p$ , we use modulo  $p$  arithmetic to compute determinants, matrix products, and inverses. To illustrate the case  $SL(2, Z_5)$ , consider the element  $A = \begin{bmatrix} 3 & 4 \\ 4 & 4 \end{bmatrix}$ . Then  $\det A = (3 \cdot 4 - 4 \cdot 4) \mod 5 = -4 \mod 5 = 1$ , and the inverse of  $A$  is  $\begin{bmatrix} 4 & -4 \\ -4 & 3 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 4 & 1 \\ 1 & 3 \end{bmatrix}$ . Note that  $\begin{bmatrix} 3 & 4 \\ 4 & 4 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 4 & 1 \\ 1 & 3 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$  when the arithmetic is done modulo 5.

Example 9 is a special case of the following general construction.

EXAMPLE 19 Let  $F$  be any of  $Q, \mathbf{R}, \mathbf{C}$ , or  $Z_{p}$  ( $p$  a prime). The set  $GL(2, F)$  of all  $2 \times 2$  matrices with nonzero determinants and entries from  $F$  is a non-Abelian group under matrix multiplication. As in Example 18, when  $F$  is  $Z_{p}$ , modulo  $p$  arithmetic is used to calculate determinants, matrix products, and inverses. The formula given in Example 9 for the inverse of  $\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix}$  remains valid for elements from  $GL(2, Z_{p})$ , provided we interpret division by  $ad - bc$  as multiplication by the inverse of  $(ad - bc)$  modulo  $p$ . For example, in  $GL(2, Z_{7})$ , consider  $\begin{bmatrix} 4 & 5 \\ 6 & 3 \end{bmatrix}$ . Then the determinant  $(ad - bc)$  mod 7 is  $(12 - 30) \mod 7 = -18 \mod 7 = 3$  and the inverse of 3 is 5 [since  $(3 \cdot 5) \mod 7 = 1$ ]. So, the inverse of  $\begin{bmatrix} 4 & 5 \\ 6 & 3 \end{bmatrix}$  is  $\begin{bmatrix} 3 \cdot 5 & 2 \cdot 5 \\ 1 \cdot 5 & 4 \cdot 5 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 \\ 5 & 6 \end{bmatrix}$ . [The reader should check that  $\begin{bmatrix} 4 & 5 \\ 6 & 3 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 3 \\ 5 & 6 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$  in  $GL(2, Z_{7})$ ].

The group  $GL(n,F)$  is called the general linear group of  $n \times n$  matrices over  $F$ .

EXAMPLE 20 The set  $\{1, 2, \dots, n - 1\}$  is a group under multiplication modulo  $n$  if and only if  $n$  is prime.

Table 2.1 summarizes many of the specific groups that we have presented thus far.

As the previous examples demonstrate, the notion of a group is a very broad one indeed. The goal of the axiomatic approach is to find properties general enough to permit many diverse examples having these properties and specific enough to allow one to deduce many interesting consequences.

The goal of abstract algebra is to discover truths about algebraic systems (i.e., sets with one or more binary operations) that are independent of the specific nature of the operations. All one knows or needs to know is that these operations, whatever they may be, have certain properties. We then seek to deduce consequences of these properties. This is why this branch of mathematics is called abstract algebra. It must be remembered, however, that when a specific group is being discussed, a specific operation must be given (at least implicitly).

# Elementary Properties of Groups

Now that we have seen many diverse examples of groups, we wish to deduce some properties that they share. The definition itself raises some fundamental questions. Every group has an identity. Could a group have more than one? Every group element has an inverse. Could an element have more than one?

The examples suggest not. But examples can only suggest. One cannot prove that every group has a unique identity by looking at examples, because each example inherently has properties that may not be shared by all groups. We are forced to restrict ourselves to the properties that all groups have; that is, we must view groups as abstract entities rather than argue by example. The next three theorems illustrate the abstract approach.

# Theorem 2.1 Uniqueness of the Identity

In a group  $G$ , there is only one identity element.

PROOF Suppose both  $e$  and  $e'$  are identities of  $G$ . Then,

1.  $ae = a$  for all  $a$  in  $G$ , and  
2.  $e^{\prime}a = a$  for all  $a$  in  $G$

The choices of  $a = e'$  in (part 1) and  $a = e$  in (part 2) yield  $e'e = e'$  and  $e'e = e$ . Thus,  $e$  and  $e'$  are both equal to  $e'e$  and so are equal to each other.

Because of this theorem, we may unambiguously speak of "the identity" of a group and denote it by  $e$  (because the German word for identity is Einheit).

# Theorem 2.2 Cancellation

In a group  $G$ , the right and left cancellation laws hold; that is,  $ba = ca$  implies  $b = c$ , and  $ab = ac$  implies  $b = c$ .

PROOF Suppose  $ba = ca$ . Let  $a'$  be an inverse of  $a$ . Then multiplying on the right by  $a'$  yields  $(ba)a' = (ca)a'$ . Associativity yields  $b(aa') = c(aa')$ . Then  $be = ce$  and, therefore,  $b = c$  as desired. Similarly, one can prove that  $ab = ac$  implies  $b = c$  by multiplying by  $a'$  on the left.

A consequence of the cancellation property is the fact that in a Cayley table for a group, each group element occurs exactly once in each row and column (see Exercise 33). Another consequence of the cancellation property is the uniqueness of inverses.

# Theorem 2.3 Uniqueness of Inverses

For each element  $a$  in a group  $G$ , there is a unique element  $b$  in  $G$  such that  $ab = ba = e$ .

PROOF Suppose  $b$  and  $c$  are both inverses of  $a$ . Then  $ab = e$  and  $ac = e$ , so that  $ab = ac$ . Canceling the  $a$  on both sides gives  $b = c$ , as desired.

As was the case with the identity element, it is reasonable, in view of Theorem 2.3, to speak of "the inverse" of an element  $g$  of a group; in fact, we may

Table 2.2  

<table><tr><td></td><td colspan="2">Multiplicative Group</td><td>Additive Group</td></tr><tr><td>a·b or ab</td><td>Multiplication</td><td>a+b</td><td>Addition</td></tr><tr><td>e or 1</td><td>Identity or one</td><td>0</td><td>Zero</td></tr><tr><td>a-1</td><td>Multiplicative inverse of a</td><td>-a</td><td>Additive inverse of a</td></tr><tr><td>an</td><td>Power of a</td><td>na</td><td>Multiple of a</td></tr><tr><td>ab-1</td><td>Quotient</td><td>a-b</td><td>difference</td></tr></table>

unambiguously denote it by  $g^{-1}$ . This notation is suggested by that used for ordinary real numbers under multiplication. Similarly, when  $n$  is a positive integer, the associative law allows us to use  $g^{n}$  to denote the unambiguous product:

![](images/ef59400b27a472c1b376dbb982389491b9a2d967b7762fd7ad6f20a42aaa76d8.jpg)  
$n$  factors

We define  $g^0 = e$ . When  $n$  is negative, we define  $g^n = (g^{-1})^{|n|}$  [e.g.,  $g^{-3} = (g^{-1})^3$ ]. Unlike for real numbers, in an abstract group we do not permit noninteger exponents such as  $g^{1/2}$ . With this notation, the familiar laws of exponents hold for groups; that is, for all integers  $m$  and  $n$  and any group element  $g$ , we have  $g^m g^n = g^{m+n}$  and  $(g^m)^n = g^{mn}$ . Although the way one manipulates the group expressions  $g^m g^n$  and  $(g^m)^n$  coincides with the laws of exponents for real numbers, the laws of exponents fail to hold for expressions involving two group elements. Thus, for groups in general,  $(ab)^2 = abab$  rather than  $a^2 b^2$ . To remove parentheses in the expression  $(ab)^{-2}$  we have  $(ab)^{-2} = ((ab)^{-1})^2 = (b^{-1}a^{-1})^2 = b^{-1}a^{-1}b^{-1}a^{-1} (ab)^n \neq a^n b^n$ . (See Exercises 25 and 36.)

The important thing about the existence of a unique inverse for each group element  $a$  is that for every element  $b$  in the group there is a unique solution in the group of the equations  $ax = b$  and  $xa = b$ . Namely,  $x = a^{-1}b$  in the first case and  $x = ba^{-1}$  in the second case. In contrast, in the set  $\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$ , the equation  $2x = 4$  has the solutions  $x = 2$  and  $x = 5$  under the operation multiplication mod 6. However, this set is not a group under multiplication mod 6.

Also, one must be careful with this notation when dealing with a specific group whose binary operation is addition and is denoted by  $+$ . In this case, the definitions and group properties expressed in multiplicative notation must be translated to additive notation. For example, the inverse of  $g$  is written as  $-g$ . Likewise, for example,  $g^3$  means  $g + g + g$  and is usually written as  $3g$ , whereas  $g^{-3}$  means  $(-g) + (-g) + (-g)$  and is written as  $-3g$ . When additive notation is used, do not interpret "ng" as combining  $n$  and  $g$  under the group operation;  $n$  may not even be an element of the group! Table 2.2 shows the common notation and corresponding terminology for groups under multiplication and groups under addition. As is the case for real numbers, we use  $a - b$  as an abbreviation for  $a + (-b)$ .

Because of the associative property, we may unambiguously write the expression  $abc$ , for this can be reasonably interpreted as only  $(ab)c$  or  $a(bc)$ , which are equal. In fact, by using induction and repeated application of the associative property, one can prove a general associative property that

essentially means that parentheses can be inserted or deleted at will without affecting the value of a product involving any number of group elements. Thus,

$$
a ^ {2} (b c d b ^ {2}) = a ^ {2} b (c d) b ^ {2} = \left(a ^ {2} b\right) (c d) b ^ {2} = a (a b c d b) b,
$$

and so on.

Although groups do not have the property that  $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$ , there is a simple relationship between  $(ab)^{-1}$  and  $a^{-1}$  and  $b^{-1}$ .

# Theorem 2.4 Socks-Shoes Property

For group elements  $a$  and  $b$ ,  $(ab)^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1}$ .

PROOF Since  $(ab)(ab)^{-1} = e$  and  $(ab)(b^{-1}a^{-1}) = a(bb^{-1})a^{-1} = ae a^{-1} = aa^{-1} = e$ , we have by Theorem 2.3 that  $(ab)^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1}$ .

# Historical Note

We conclude this chapter with a bit of history concerning the noncommutativity of matrix multiplication. In 1925, quantum theory was replete with annoying and puzzling ambiguities. It was Werner Heisenberg who recognized the cause. He observed that the product of the quantum-theoretical analogs of the classical Fourier series did not necessarily commute. For all his boldness, this shook Heisenberg. As he later recalled [2, p. 94]:

In my paper the fact that  $XY$  was not equal to  $YX$  was very disagreeable to me. I felt this was the only point of difficulty in the whole scheme, otherwise I would be perfectly happy. But this difficulty had worried me and I was not able to solve it.

Heisenberg asked his teacher, Max Born, if his ideas were worth publishing. Born was fascinated and deeply impressed by Heisenberg's new approach. Born wrote [1, p. 217]:

After having sent off Heisenberg's paper to the Zeitschrift für Physik for publication, I began to ponder over his symbolic multiplication, and was soon so involved in it that I thought about it for the whole day and could hardly sleep at night. For I felt there was something fundamental behind it, the consummation of our endeavors of many years. And one morning, about the 10 July 1925, I suddenly saw light: Heisenberg's symbolic multiplication was nothing but the matrix calculus, well-known to me since my student days from Rosanes' lectures in Breslau.

Born and his student, Pascual Jordan, reformulated Heisenberg's ideas in terms of matrices, but it was Heisenberg who was credited with the formulation. In his autobiography, Born lamented [1, p. 219]:

Nowadays the textbooks speak without exception of Heisenberg's matrices, Heisenberg's commutation law, and Dirac's field quantization.

In fact, Heisenberg knew at that time very little of matrices and had to study them.

Upon learning in 1933 that he was to receive the Nobel Prize with Dirac and Schrödinger for this work, Heisenberg wrote to Born [1, p. 220]:

If I have not written to you for such a long time, and have not thanked you for your congratulations, it was partly because of my rather bad conscience with respect to you. The fact that I am to receive the Nobel Prize alone, for work done in Göttingen in collaboration—you, Jordan, and I—this fact depresses me and I hardly know what to write to you. I am, of course, glad that our common efforts are now appreciated, and I enjoy the recollection of the beautiful time of collaboration. I also believe that all good physicists know how great was your and Jordan's contribution to the structure of quantum mechanics—and this remains unchanged by a wrong decision from outside. Yet I myself can do nothing but thank you again for all the fine collaboration, and feel a little ashamed.

The story has a happy ending, however, because Born received the Nobel Prize in 1954 for his fundamental work in quantum mechanics.

# 3 Finite Groups; Subgroups

In our own time, in the period 1960-1980, we have seen particle physics emerge as the playground of group theory.

Freeman Dyson

What brought order and logic to the building blocks of matter ... was something called a "symmetry group"—a mathematical beast that Frenkel had never encountered in school. "This was a moment of epiphany," he recalls, a vision of "an entirely different world."

Jim Holt in The New York Review of Books December 5, 2013

# Terminology and Notation

As we will soon discover, finite groups—that is, groups with finitely many elements—have interesting arithmetic properties. To facilitate the study of finite groups, it is convenient to introduce some terminology and notation.

# Definition Order of a Group

The number of elements of a group (finite or infinite) is called its order. We will use  $|G|$  to denote the order of  $G$ .

Thus, the group  $Z$  of integers under addition has infinite order, whereas the group  $U(10) = \{1, 3, 7, 9\}$  under multiplication modulo 10 has order 4.

# Definition Order of an Element

The order of an element  $g$  in a group  $G$  is the smallest positive integer  $n$  such that  $g^n = e$ . (In additive notation, this would be  $ng = 0$ .) If no such integer exists, we say that  $g$  has infinite order. The order of an element  $g$  is denoted by  $|g|$ .

So, to find the order of a group element  $g$ , you need only compute the sequence of products  $g, g^2, g^3, \ldots$ , until you reach the identity for the first time. The exponent of this product (or coefficient if the operation is addition) is the order of  $g$ . If the identity never appears in the sequence, then  $g$  has infinite order.

EXAMPLE 1 Consider  $U(15) = \{1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14\}$  under multiplication modulo 15. This group has order 8. To find the order of the element 7, say, we compute the sequence  $7^1 = 7$ ,  $7^2 = 4$ ,  $7^3 = 13$ ,  $7^4 = 1$ , so  $|7| = 4$ . To find the order of 11, we compute  $11^1 = 11$ ,  $11^2 = 1$ , so  $|11| = 2$ . Similar

computations show that  $|1| = 1$ ,  $|2| = 4$ ,  $|4| = 2$ ,  $|8| = 4$ ,  $|13| = 4$ ,  $|14| = 2$ . [Here is a trick that makes these calculations easier. Rather than compute the sequence  $13^1, 13^2, 13^3, 13^4$ , we may observe that  $13 = -2 \mod 15$ , so that  $13^2 = (-2)^2 = 4$ ,  $13^3 = -2 \cdot 4 = -8$ ,  $13^4 = (-2)(-8) = 1$ .]

EXAMPLE 2 Consider  $Z_{10}$  under addition modulo 10. Since  $1 \cdot 2 = 2$ ,  $2 \cdot 2 = 4, 3 \cdot 2 = 6, 4 \cdot 2 = 8, 5 \cdot 2 = 0$ , we know that  $|2| = 5$ . Similar computations show that  $|0| = 1$ ,  $|7| = 10$ ,  $|5| = 2$ ,  $|6| = 5$ . (Here  $2 \cdot 2$  is an abbreviation for  $2 + 2, 3 \cdot 2$  is an abbreviation for  $2 + 2 + 2$ , etc.)

EXAMPLE 3 Consider  $Z$  under ordinary addition. Here every nonzero element has infinite order, since the sequence  $a, 2a, 3a, \ldots$  never includes 0 when  $a \neq 0$ .

The perceptive reader may have noticed among our examples of groups in Chapter 2 that some are subsets of others with the same binary operation. The group  $SL(2, \mathbf{R})$  in Example 18, for instance, is a subset of the group  $GL(2, \mathbf{R})$  in Example 9. Similarly, the group of complex numbers  $\{1, -1, i, -i\}$  under multiplication is a subset of the group described in Example 16 for  $n$  equal to any multiple of 4. This situation arises so often that we introduce a special term to describe it.

# Definition Subgroup

If a subset  $H$  of a group  $G$  is itself a group under the operation of  $G$ , we say that  $H$  is a subgroup of  $G$ .

We use the notation  $H \leq G$  to mean that  $H$  is a subgroup of  $G$ . If we want to indicate that  $H$  is a subgroup of  $G$  but is not equal to  $G$  itself, we write  $H < G$ . Such a subgroup is called a proper subgroup. The subgroup  $\{e\}$  is called the trivial subgroup of  $G$ ; a subgroup that is not  $\{e\}$  is called a nontrivial subgroup of  $G$ .

Notice that  $Z_{n}$  under addition modulo  $n$  is not a subgroup of  $Z$  under addition, since addition modulo  $n$  is not the operation of  $Z$ .

# Subgroup Tests

When determining whether or not a subset  $H$  of a group  $G$  is a subgroup of  $G$ , one need not directly verify the group axioms. The next three results provide simple tests that suffice to show that a subset of a group is a subgroup.

# Theorem 3.1 One-Step Subgroup Test

Let  $G$  be a group and  $H$  a nonempty subset of  $G$ . If  $ab^{-1}$  is in  $H$  whenever  $a$  and  $b$  are in  $H$ , then  $H$  is a subgroup of  $G$ . (In additive notation, if  $a - b$  is in  $H$  whenever  $a$  and  $b$  are in  $H$ , then  $H$  is a subgroup of  $G$ .)

PROOF Since the operation of  $H$  is the same as that of  $G$ , it is clear that this operation is associative. Next, we show that  $e$  is in  $H$ . Since  $H$  is nonempty, we may pick some  $x$  in  $H$ . Then, letting  $a = x$  and  $b = x$  in the hypothesis, we have  $e = xx^{-1} = ab^{-1}$  is in  $H$ . To verify that  $x^{-1}$  is in  $H$  whenever  $x$  is in  $H$ , all we need to do is to choose  $a = e$  and  $b = x$  in the statement of the theorem. Finally, the proof will be complete when we show that  $H$  is closed; that is, if  $x, y$  belong to  $H$ , we must show that  $xy$  is in  $H$  also. Well, we have already shown that  $y^{-1}$  is in  $H$  whenever  $y$  is; so, letting  $a = x$  and  $b = y^{-1}$ , we have  $xy = x(y^{-1})^{-1} = ab^{-1}$  is in  $H$ .

Although we have dubbed Theorem 3.1 the One-Step Subgroup Test, there are actually four steps involved in applying the theorem. (After you gain some experience, the first three steps will be routine.) Notice the similarity between the last three steps listed below and the three steps involved in the Second Principle of Mathematical Induction.

1. Identify the property  $P$  that distinguishes the elements of  $H$ ; that is, identify a defining condition.  
2. Prove that the identity has property  $P$ . (This verifies that  $H$  is nonempty.)  
3. Assume that two elements  $a$  and  $b$  have property  $P$ .  
4. Use the assumption that  $a$  and  $b$  have property  $P$  to show that  $ab^{-1}$  has property  $P$ .

The procedure is illustrated in Examples 4 and 5.

EXAMPLE 4 Let  $G$  be an Abelian group with identity  $e$ . Then  $H = \{x \in G \mid x^2 = e\}$  is a subgroup of  $G$ . Here, the defining property of  $H$  is the condition  $x^2 = e$ . So, we first note that  $e^2 = e$ , so that  $H$  is nonempty. Now we assume that  $a$  and  $b$  belong to  $H$ . This means that  $a^2 = e$  and  $b^2 = e$ . Finally, we must show that  $(ab^{-1})^2 = e$ . Since  $G$  is Abelian,  $(ab^{-1})^2 = ab^{-1}ab^{-1} = a^2(b^{-1})^2 = a^2(b^2)^{-1} = ee^{-1} = e$ . Therefore,  $ab^{-1}$  belongs to  $H$  and, by the One-Step Subgroup Test,  $H$  is a subgroup of  $G$ .

In many instances, a subgroup will consist of all elements that have a particular form. Then the property  $P$  is that the elements have that particular form. This is illustrated in the following example.

EXAMPLE 5 Let  $G$  be an Abelian group under multiplication with identity  $e$ . Then  $H = \{x^2 \mid x \in G\}$  is a subgroup of  $G$ . (In words,  $H$  is the set of all "squares.") Since  $e^2 = e$ , the identity has the correct form. Next, we write two elements of  $H$  in the correct form, say,  $a^2$  and  $b^2$ . We must show that  $a^2 (b^2)^{-1}$  also has the correct form; that is,  $a^2 (b^2)^{-1}$  is the square of some element. Since  $G$  is Abelian, we may write  $a^2 (b^2)^{-1}$  as  $(ab^{-1})^2$ , which is the correct form. Thus,  $H$  is a subgroup of  $G$ .

Beginning students often prefer to use the next theorem instead of Theorem 3.1.

# Theorem 3.2 Two-Step Subgroup Test

Let  $G$  be a group and let  $H$  be a nonempty subset of  $G$ . If  $ab$  is in  $H$  whenever  $a$  and  $b$  are in  $H$  ( $H$  is closed under the operation), and  $a^{-1}$  is in  $H$  whenever  $a$  is in  $H$  ( $H$  is closed under taking inverses), then  $H$  is a subgroup of  $G$ .

PROOF Since  $H$  is nonempty, the operation of  $H$  is associative,  $H$  is closed, and every element of  $H$  has an inverse in  $H$ , all that remains to show is that  $e$  is in  $H$ . To this end, let  $a$  belong to  $H$ . Then  $a^{-1}$  and  $aa^{-1} = e$  are in  $H$ .

When applying the Two-Step Subgroup Test, we proceed exactly as in the case of the One-Step Subgroup Test, except we use the assumption that  $a$  and  $b$  have property  $P$  to prove that  $ab$  has property  $P$  and that  $a^{-1}$  has property  $P$ .

EXAMPLE 6 Let  $G$  be an Abelian group. Then  $H = \{x \in G \mid |x|$  is finite\} is a subgroup of  $G$ . Since  $e^1 = e, H \neq \emptyset$ . To apply the Two-Step Subgroup Test we assume that  $a$  and  $b$  belong to  $H$  and prove that  $ab$  and  $a^{-1}$  belong to  $H$ . Let  $|a| = m$  and  $|b| = n$ . Then, because  $G$  is Abelian, we have  $(ab)^{mn} = (a^m)^n (b^n)^m = e^n e^m = e$ . Thus,  $ab$  has finite order (this does not show that  $|ab| = mn$ ). Moreover,  $(a^{-1})^m = (a^m)^{-1} = e^{-1} = e$  shows that  $a^{-1}$  has finite order.

We next illustrate how to use the Two-Step Subgroup Test by introducing an important technique for creating new subgroups of Abelian groups from existing ones. It is a preview of a method that will be extended to certain subgroups of non-Abelian groups in later chapters.

EXAMPLE 7 Let  $G$  be an Abelian group and  $H$  and  $K$  be subgroups of  $G$ . Then  $HK = \{hk \mid h \in H, k \in K\}$  is a subgroup of  $G$ . First note that  $e = ee$  belongs to  $HK$  because  $e$  is in both  $H$  and  $K$ . Now suppose that  $a$  and  $b$  are in  $HK$ . Then by definition of  $HK$  there are elements  $h_1, h_2 \in H$  and  $k_1, k_2 \in K$  such that  $a = h_1k_1$  and  $b = h_2k_2$ . We must prove that  $ab \in HK$  and  $a^{-1} \in HK$ . Observe that because  $G$  is Abelian and  $H$  and  $K$  are subgroups of  $G$ , we have  $ab = h_1k_1h_2k_2 = (h_1h_2)(k_1k_2) \in HK$ . Likewise,  $a^{-1} = (h_1k_1)^{-1} = k_1^{-1}h_1^{-1} = h_1^{-1}k_1^{-1} \in HK$ .

How do you prove that a subset of a group is not a subgroup? Here are three possible ways, any one of which guarantees that the subset is not a subgroup:

1. Show that the identity is not in the set.  
2. Exhibit an element of the set whose inverse is not in the set.  
3. Exhibit two elements of the set whose product is not in the set.

EXAMPLE 8 Let  $G$  be the group of nonzero real numbers under multiplication,  $H = \{x \in G \mid x = 1 \text{ or } x \text{ is irrational}\}$  and  $K = \{x \in G \mid x \geq 1\}$ . Then  $H$  is not a subgroup of  $G$ , since  $\sqrt{2} \in H$  but  $\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2} = 2 \notin H$ . Also,  $K$  is not a subgroup, since  $2 \in K$  but  $2^{-1} \notin K$ .

When dealing with finite groups, it is easier to use the following subgroup test.

# Theorem 3.3 Finite Subgroup Test

Let  $H$  be a nonempty finite subset of a group  $G$ . If  $H$  is closed under the operation of  $G$ , then  $H$  is a subgroup of  $G$ .

PROOF In view of Theorem 3.2, we need only prove that  $a^{-1} \in H$  whenever  $a \in H$ . If  $a = e$ , then  $a^{-1} = a$  and we are done. If  $a \neq e$ , consider the sequence  $a, a^2, \ldots$ . By closure, all of these elements belong to  $H$ . Since  $H$  is finite, not all of these elements are distinct. Say  $a^i = a^j$  and  $i > j$ . Then,  $a^{i - j} = e$ ; and since  $a \neq e, i - j > 1$ . Thus,  $aa^{i - j - 1} = a^{i - j} = e$  and, therefore,  $a^{i - j - 1} = a^{-1}$ . But  $i - j - 1 \geq 0$  implies  $a^{i - j - 1} \in H$  and we are done.

# Examples of Subgroups

The proofs of the next few theorems show how our subgroup tests work. We first introduce an important notation. For any element  $a$  from a group, we let  $\langle a \rangle$  denote the set  $\{a^n \mid n \in Z\}$ . In particular, observe that the exponents of  $a$  include all negative integers as well as 0 and the positive integers  $(a^0$  is defined to be the identity).

# Theorem 3.4  $\langle a\rangle$  Is a Subgroup

Let  $G$  be a group, and let  $a$  be any element of  $G$ . Then,  $\langle a \rangle$  is a subgroup of  $G$ .

PROOF Since  $a \in \langle a \rangle$ ,  $\langle a \rangle$  is not empty. Let  $a^n$ ,  $a^m \in \langle a \rangle$ . Then,  $a^n (a^m)^{-1} = a^{n - m} \in \langle a \rangle$ ; so, by Theorem 3.1,  $\langle a \rangle$  is a subgroup of  $G$ .

The subgroup  $\langle a\rangle$  is called the cyclic subgroup of  $G$  generated by  $a$ . In the case that  $G = \langle a\rangle$ , we say that  $G$  is cyclic and  $a$  is a generator of  $G$ . (A cyclic group may have many generators.) Notice that although the list  $\ldots, a^{-2}, a^{-1}, a^0, a^1, a^2, \ldots$  has infinitely many entries, the set  $\{a^n \mid n \in Z\}$  might have only finitely many elements. Also note that, since  $a^i a^j = a^{i+j} = a^{j+i} = a^j a^i$ , every cyclic group is Abelian.

EXAMPLE 9 In  $U(10), \langle 3 \rangle = \{3, 9, 7, 1\} = U(10)$ , for  $3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 7, 3^4 = 1, 3^5 = 3^4 \cdot 3 = 1 \cdot 3, 3^6 = 3^4 \cdot 3^2 = 9, \ldots; 3^{-1} = 7$  (since  $3 \cdot 7 = 1$ ),  $3^{-2} = 9, 3^{-3} = 3, 3^{-4} = 1, 3^{-5} = 3^{-4} \cdot 3^{-1} = 1 \cdot 7, 3^{-6} = 3^{-4} \cdot 3^{-2} = 1 \cdot 9 = 9, \ldots$ ).

EXAMPLE 10 In  $Z_{10}, \langle 2 \rangle = \{2, 4, 6, 8, 0\}$ . Remember,  $a^n$  means  $na$  when the operation is addition.

EXAMPLE 11 In  $Z, \langle -1 \rangle = Z$ . Here each entry in the list ...,  $-2(-1), -1(-1), 0(-1), 1(-1), 2(-1), \ldots$  represents a distinct group element.

EXAMPLE 12 In  $D_{n}$ , the dihedral group of order  $2n$ , let  $R$  denote a rotation of  $360 / n$  degrees. Then,

$$
R ^ {n} = R _ {3 6 0 ^ {\circ}} = e, \quad R ^ {n + 1} = R, \quad R ^ {n + 2} = R ^ {2}, \dots .
$$

Similarly,  $R^{-1} = R^{n - 1}, R^{-2} = R^{n - 2}, \ldots$ , so that  $\langle R \rangle = \{e, R, \ldots, R^{n - 1}\}$ . We see, then, that the powers of  $R$  "cycle back" periodically with period  $n$ . Visually, raising  $R$  to successive positive powers is the same as moving counterclockwise around the following circle one node at a time, whereas raising  $R$  to successive negative powers is the same as moving around the circle clockwise one node at a time.

# EXAMPLE 13  $D_{3}$  is a Subgroup of  $D_{6}$

Consider the equilateral triangle inscribed in the regular hexagon as shown in the figure below. Let  $F$  be a reflection that passes through one vertex of the triangle to the opposite vertex of the hexagon. Then  $K = \{R_0, R_{120}, R_{240}, F, R_{120}F, R_{240}F\}$  is a subgroup of  $D_6$ .

In Chapter 4 we will show that  $|\langle a\rangle | = |a|$ ; that is, the order of the subgroup generated by  $a$  is the order of  $a$  itself. (Actually, the definition of  $|a|$  was chosen to ensure the validity of this equation.)

For any element  $a$  of a group  $G$ , it is useful to think of  $\langle a \rangle$  as the smallest subgroup of  $G$  containing  $a$ . This notion can be extended to any collection  $S$  of elements from a group  $G$  by defining  $\langle S \rangle$  as the subgroup of  $G$  with the property that  $\langle S \rangle$  contains  $S$  and if  $H$  is any subgroup of  $G$  containing  $S$ , then  $H$  also contains  $\langle S \rangle$ . Thus,  $\langle S \rangle$  is the smallest subgroup of  $G$  that contains  $S$ . The set  $\langle S \rangle$  is called the subgroup generated by  $S$ . We illustrate this concept in the next example.

EXAMPLE 14 In  $Z_{20}$ ,  $\langle 8, 14 \rangle = \{0, 2, 4, \dots, 18\} = \langle 2 \rangle$ .

In  $Z$ ,  $\langle 8,13\rangle = Z$

In  $D_4$ ,  $\langle H, V \rangle = \{H, H^2, V, HV\} = \{R_0, R_{180}, H, V\}$ .

In  $D_4, \langle R_{90}, V \rangle = \{R_{90}, R_{90}^2, R_{90}^3, R_{90}^4, V, R_{90}V, R_{90}^2V, R_{90}^3V\} = D_4$

In  $\mathbf{R}$ , the group of real numbers under addition,  $\langle 2,\pi ,\sqrt{2}\rangle = \{2a + b\pi + c\sqrt{2} \mid a,b,c \in Z\}$ .

In  $\mathbf{C}$ , the group of complex numbers under addition,  $\langle 1,i\rangle = \{a + bi\mid a,b\in Z\}$ .

(This group is called the "Gaussian integers.")

In  $\mathbf{C}^*$ , the group of nonzero complex numbers under multiplication,  $\langle 1,i\rangle = \{1, -1,i, -i\} = \langle i\rangle$ .

We next consider one of the most important subgroups.

# Definition Center of a Group

The center,  $Z(G)$ , of a group  $G$  is the subset of elements in  $G$  that commute with every element of  $G$ . In symbols,

$$
Z (G) = \{a \in G \mid a x = x a \text {f o r a l l} x \text {i n} G \}.
$$

The notation  $Z(G)$  comes from the fact that the German word for center is Zentrum. The term was coined by J. A. de Séguier in 1904.

# Theorem 3.5 Center Is a Subgroup

# The center of a group  $G$  is a subgroup of  $G$ .

PROOF For variety, we shall use Theorem 3.2 to prove this result. Clearly,  $e \in Z(G)$ , so  $Z(G)$  is nonempty. Now, suppose  $a, b \in Z(G)$ . Then  $(ab)x = a(bx) = a(xb) = (ax)b = (xa)b = x(ab)$  for all  $x$  in  $G$ ; and, therefore,  $ab \in Z(G)$ .

Next, assume that  $a \in Z(G)$ . Then we have  $ax = xa$  for all  $x$  in  $G$ . What we want is  $a^{-1}x = xa^{-1}$  for all  $x$  in  $G$ . The desired equation can be obtained from the original one by multiplying it on the left and right by  $a^{-1}$ , like so:

$$
\begin{array}{l} a ^ {- 1} (a x) a ^ {- 1} = a ^ {- 1} (x a) a ^ {- 1}, \\ (a ^ {- 1} a) x a ^ {- 1} = a ^ {- 1} x \left(a a ^ {- 1}\right), \\ e x a ^ {- 1} = a ^ {- 1} x e, \\ \begin{array}{r c l} x a ^ {- 1} & = & a ^ {- 1} x. \end{array} \\ \end{array}
$$

This shows that  $a^{-1} \in Z(G)$  whenever  $a$  is.

For practice, let's determine the centers of the dihedral groups.

EXAMPLE 15 For  $n \geq 3$ ,

$$
Z (D _ {n}) = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l} \{R _ {0}, R _ {1 8 0} \} & \text {w h e n n i s e v e n ,} \\ \{R _ {0} \} & \text {w h e n n i s o d d .} \end{array} \right.
$$

To verify this, first observe that since every rotation in  $D_{n}$  is a power of  $R_{360 / n}$ , rotations commute with rotations. We now investigate when a rotation commutes with a reflection. Let  $R$  be any rotation in  $D_{n}$  and let  $F$  be any reflection in  $D_{n}$ . Observe that since  $RF$  is a reflection we have  $RF = (RF)^{-1} = F^{-1}R^{-1} = FR^{-1}$ . Thus, it follows that  $R$  and  $F$  commute if and only if  $FR = RF = FR^{-1}$ . By cancellation, this holds if and only if

$R = R^{-1}$ . But  $R = R^{-1}$  only when  $R = R_0$  or  $R = R_{180}$ , and  $R_{180}$  is in  $D_{n}$  only when  $n$  is even. So, we have proved that  $Z(D_{n}) = \{R_{0}\}$  when  $n$  is odd and  $Z(D_{n}) = \{R_{0},R_{180}\}$  when  $n$  is even.

Although an element from a non-Abelian group does not necessarily commute with every element of the group, there are always some elements with which it will commute. For example, every element  $a$  commutes with all powers of  $a$ . This observation prompts the next definition and theorem.

# Definition Centralizer of  $a$  in  $G$

Let  $a$  be a fixed element of a group  $G$ . The centralizer of  $a$  in  $G$ ,  $C(a)$ , is the set of all elements in  $G$  that commute with  $a$ . In symbols,  $C(a) = \{g \in G \mid ga = ag\}$ .

EXAMPLE 16 In  $D_4$ , we have the following centralizers:

$$
\begin{array}{l} C (R _ {0}) = D _ {4} = C (R _ {1 8 0}), \\ C (R _ {9 0}) = \{R _ {0}, R _ {9 0}, R _ {1 8 0}, R _ {2 7 0} \} = C (R _ {2 7 0}), \\ C (H) = \{R _ {0}, H, R _ {1 8 0}, V \} = C (V), \\ C (D) = \{R _ {0}, D, R _ {1 8 0}, D ^ {\prime} \} = C (D ^ {\prime}). \\ \end{array}
$$

Notice that each of the centralizers in Example 16 is actually a subgroup of  $D_4$ . The next theorem shows that this was not a coincidence.

# Theorem 3.6  $C(a)$  Is a Subgroup

For each  $a$  in a group  $G$ , the centralizer of  $a$  is a subgroup of  $G$ .

PROOF A proof similar to that of Theorem 3.5 is left to the reader to supply (Exercise 47).

Notice that for every element  $a$  of a group  $G$ ,  $Z(G) \subseteq C(a)$ . Also, observe that  $G$  is Abelian if and only if  $C(a) = G$  for all  $a$  in  $G$ .

# 4 Cyclic Groups

The notion of a "group," viewed only 30 years ago as the epitome of sophistication, is today one of the mathematical concepts most widely used in physics, chemistry, biochemistry, and mathematics itself.

AlexeySosinsky,1991

Indeed, group theory achieved precisely that—a unity and indivisibility of the patterns underlying a wide range of seemingly unrelated disciplines.

# Properties of Cyclic Groups

Recall from Chapter 3 that a group  $G$  is called cyclic if there is an element  $a$  in  $G$  such that  $G = \{a^n \mid n \in Z\}$ . Such an element  $a$  is called a generator of  $G$ . In view of the notation introduced in the preceding chapter, we may indicate that  $G$  is a cyclic group generated by  $a$  by writing  $G = \langle a \rangle$ .

In this chapter, we examine cyclic groups in detail and determine their important characteristics. We begin with a few examples.

EXAMPLE 1 The set of integers  $Z$  under ordinary addition is cyclic. Both 1 and -1 are generators. (Recall that, when the operation is addition,  $1^n$  is interpreted as

$$
\underbrace {1 + 1 + \cdots + 1} _ {n \text {t e r m s}}
$$

when  $n$  is positive and as

$$
\underbrace {(- 1) + (- 1) + \cdots + (- 1)} _ {| n | \text {t e r m s}}
$$

when  $n$  is negative.)

EXAMPLE 2 The set  $Z_{n} = \{0,1,\dots,n - 1\}$  for  $n\geq 1$  is a cyclic group under addition modulo  $n$ . Again, 1 and  $-1 = n - 1$  are generators.

Unlike  $Z$ , which has only two generators,  $Z_{n}$  may have many generators (depending on which  $n$  we are given).

EXAMPLE 3  $Z_{8} = \langle 1 \rangle = \langle 3 \rangle = \langle 5 \rangle = \langle 7 \rangle$ . To verify, for instance, that  $Z_{8} = \langle 3 \rangle$ , we note that  $\langle 3 \rangle = \{3, 3 + 3, 3 + 3 + 3, \ldots\}$  is the set  $\{3, 6, 1, 4, 7, 2, 5, 0\} = Z_{8}$ . Thus, 3 is a generator of  $Z_{8}$ . On the other hand, 2 is not a generator, since  $\langle 2 \rangle = \{0, 2, 4, 6\} \neq Z_{8}$ .

EXAMPLE 4 (See Example 12 in Chapter 2.)

$$
\begin{array}{l} U (1 0) = \{1, 3, 7, 9 \} = \{3 ^ {0}, 3 ^ {1}, 3 ^ {3}, 3 ^ {2} \} = \langle 3 \rangle . \text {A l s o ,} \{1, 3, 7, 9 \} = \\ \{7 ^ {0}, 7 ^ {3}, 7 ^ {1}, 7 ^ {2} \} = \langle 7 \rangle . \text {S o b o t h 3 a n d 7 a r e g e n e r a t o r s f o r} U (1 0). \end{array}
$$

Quite often in mathematics, a "nonexample" is as helpful in understanding a concept as an example. With regard to cyclic groups,  $U(8)$  serves this purpose; that is,  $U(8)$  is not a cyclic group. How can we verify this? Well, note that  $U(8) = \{1, 3, 5, 7\}$ . But

$$
\langle 1 \rangle = \langle 1 \rangle , \langle 3 \rangle = \{3, 1 \}, \langle 5 \rangle = \{5, 1 \}, \langle 7 \rangle = \{7, 1 \},
$$

so  $U(8)\neq \langle a\rangle$  for any  $a$  in  $U(8)$

With these examples under our belts, we are now ready to tackle cyclic groups in an abstract way and state their key properties.

# Theorem 4.1 Criterion for  $a^i = a^j$

Let  $G$  be a group, and let  $a$  belong to  $G$ . If  $a$  has infinite order, then  $a^i = a^j$  if and only if  $i = j$ . If  $a$  has finite order, say,  $n$ , then  $\langle a \rangle = \{e, a, a^2, \ldots, a^{n-1}\}$  and  $a^i = a^j$  if and only if  $n$  divides  $i - j$ .

PROOF If  $a$  has infinite order, there is no nonzero  $n$  such that  $a^n$  is the identity. Since  $a^i = a^j$  implies  $a^{i - j} = e$ , we must have  $i - j = 0$ , and the first statement of the theorem is proved.

Now assume that  $|a| = n$ . We will prove that  $\langle a \rangle = \{e, a, \ldots, a^{n-1}\}$ . Certainly, the elements  $e, a, \ldots, a^{n-1}$  are in  $\langle a \rangle$ .

Next suppose that  $a^k$  is an arbitrary member of  $\langle a \rangle$ . By the division algorithm, there exist integers  $q$  and  $r$  such that

$$
k = n q + r \quad \text {w i t h} \quad 0 \leq r <   n.
$$

Then  $a^k = a^{nq + r} = a^{nq}a^r = (a^n)^q a^r = ea^r = a^r$ , so that  $a^k \in \{e, a, a^2, \ldots, a^{n-1}\}$ . This proves that  $\langle a \rangle = \{e, a, a^2, \ldots, a^{n-1}\}$ .

Next, we assume that  $a^i = a^j$  and prove that  $n$  divides  $i - j$ . We begin by observing that  $a^i = a^j$  implies  $a^{i - j} = e$ . Again, by the division algorithm, there are integers  $q$  and  $r$  such that

$$
i - j = n q + r \quad \text {w i t h} \quad 0 \leq r <   n.
$$

Then  $a^{i - j} = a^{nq + r}$ , and therefore  $e = a^{i - j} = a^{nq + r} = (a^n)^q a^r = e^q a^r = ea^r = a^r$ . Since  $n$  is the least positive integer such that  $a^n$  is the identity, we must have  $r = 0$ , so that  $n$  divides  $i - j$ .

Conversely, if  $i - j = nq$ , then  $a^{i - j} = a^{nq} = e^q = e$ , so that  $a^i = a^j$ .

Theorem 4.1 reveals the reason for the dual use of the notation and terminology for the order of an element and the order of a group.

Corollary 1  $|a| = |\langle a \rangle|$

For any group element  $a, |a| = |\langle a\rangle|$ .

One special case of Theorem 4.1 occurs so often that it deserves singling out.

Corollary 2  $a^k = e$  If and Only If  $|a|$  Divides  $k$

For any group element  $a, a^k = e$  if and only if  $|a|$  divides  $k$ .

PROOF We know from Theorem 4.1 that  $a^k = e$  if and only if  $n$  divides  $k - 0 = k$ .

In many situations the following reformulation of Corollary 2 is helpful.

■ Corollary 3  $a^k = e$  If and Only if  $k$  is a Multiple of  $|a|$

For any group element  $a, a^k = e$  if and only if  $k$  is a multiple of  $|a|$ .

Exercises 52 and 54 of Chapter 3 demonstrate that, in general, there is no relationship between  $|ab|$  and  $|a|$  and  $|b|$ . Let me say this in a slightly different way. Believe it or not, knowing only  $|a|$  and  $|b|$  tells us nothing about  $|ab|$ .

However we have the following useful fact. (See Exercise 23 for a stronger statement.)

Corollary 4 Relationship between  $|ab|$  and  $|a||b|$

If  $a$  and  $b$  belong to a finite group and  $ab = ba$ , then  $|ab|$  divides  $|a||b|$ .

PROOF Let  $|a| = m$  and  $|b| = n$ . Then  $(ab)^{mn} = (a^m)^n (b^n)^m = e^n e^m = e$ . So, by Corollary 2 of Theorem 4.1 we have that  $|ab|$  divides  $mn$ .

Theorem 4.1 and its corollaries for the case  $|a| = 6$  are illustrated in Figure 4.1.

What is important about Theorem 4.1 in the finite case is that it says that multiplication in  $\langle a\rangle$  is essentially done by addition modulo  $n$ . That is, if  $(i + j)$  mod  $n = k$ , then  $a^i a^j = a^k$ . Thus, no matter what group  $G$  is, or how the element  $a$  is chosen, multiplication in  $\langle a\rangle$  works the same as addition in  $Z_{n}$  whenever  $|a| = n$ . Similarly, if  $a$  has infinite order, then multiplication in  $\langle a\rangle$  works the same as addition in  $Z$ , since  $a^i a^j = a^{i + j}$  and no modular arithmetic is done.

For these reasons, the cyclic groups  $Z_{n}$  and  $Z$  serve as prototypes for all cyclic groups, and algebraists say that there is essentially only one cyclic

Figure 4.1 Powers of a for  $|a| = 6$ .

group of each order. What is meant by this is that, although there may be many different sets of the form  $\{a^n \mid n \in Z\}$ , there is essentially only one way to operate on these sets. Algebraists do not really care what the elements of a set are; they care only about the algebraic properties of the set—that is, the ways in which the elements of a set can be combined. We will return to this theme in the chapter on isomorphisms (Chapter 6).

The next theorem provides a simple method for computing  $|a^k|$  knowing only  $|a|$ , and its first corollary provides a simple way to tell when  $\langle a^i\rangle = \langle a^j\rangle$ .

Theorem 4.2  $\langle a^k\rangle = \langle a^{\gcd (n,k)}\rangle$  and  $|a^{k}| = n / \gcd (n,k)$

Let  $a$  be an element of order  $n$  in a group and let  $k$  be a positive integer. Then  $\langle a^k \rangle = \langle a^{\gcd(n, k)} \rangle$  and  $|a^k| = n / \gcd(n, k)$ .

PROOF To simplify the notation, let  $d = \gcd(n, k)$  and let  $k = dr$ . Since  $a^k = (a^d)^r$ , we have by closure that  $\langle a^k \rangle \subseteq \langle a^d \rangle$ . By Theorem 0.2 (the gcd theorem), there are integers  $s$  and  $t$  such that  $d = ns + kt$ . So,

$$
a ^ {d} = a ^ {n s + k t} = a ^ {n s} a ^ {k t} = (a ^ {n}) ^ {s} (a ^ {k}) ^ {t} = e (a ^ {k}) ^ {t} = \left(a ^ {k}\right) ^ {t} \in \langle a ^ {k} \rangle .
$$

This proves  $\langle a^d\rangle \subseteq \langle a^k\rangle$ . So, we have verified that  $\langle a^k\rangle = \langle a^{\gcd (n,k)}\rangle$

We prove the second part of the theorem by showing first that  $|a^d| = n / d$  for any divisor  $d$  of  $n$ . Clearly,  $(a^d)^{n / d} = a^n = e$ , so that  $|a^d| \leq n / d$ . On the other hand, if  $i$  is a positive integer less than  $n / d$ , then  $(a^d)^i \neq e$  by definition of  $|a|$ . We now apply this fact with  $d = \gcd(n, k)$  to obtain  $|a^k| = |\langle a^k\rangle| = |\langle a^{\gcd(n, k)}\rangle| = |\langle a^{\gcd(n, k)}\rangle| = n / \gcd(n, k)$ .

By doing simple arithmetic the next two examples illustrate how Theorem 4.2 allows us to easily list the elements of cyclic subgroups and compute the orders of elements of a cyclic group in cases where the elements are inconvenient to work with.

EXAMPLE 5 For  $|a| = 30$  we find  $\langle a^{26} \rangle, \langle a^{17} \rangle, \langle a^{18} \rangle$  and  $|a^{26}|, |a^{17}|$ , and  $|a^{18}|$ . Since  $\gcd(30,26) = 2$ , we have  $\langle a^{26} \rangle = \langle a^2 \rangle = \{e, a^2, a^4, a^6, \ldots, a^{28}\}$  and  $|a^{26}| = |a^2| = 30/2 = 15$ . Since  $\gcd(30,17) = 1$ , we have  $\langle a^{17} \rangle = \langle a^1 \rangle = \{e, a, a^2, a^3, \ldots, a^{29}\}$  and  $|a^{17}| = |a^1| = 30/1 = 30$ . Since  $\gcd(30,18) = 6$ , we have  $\langle a^{18} \rangle = \langle a^6 \rangle = \{e, a^6, a^{12}, a^{18}, a^{24}\}$  and  $|a^{18}| = |a^6| = 30/6 = 5$ .

For large values of  $n$  and  $k$  we find  $\gcd(n, k)$  by using the prime-power factorization of  $n$  and  $k$ .

EXAMPLE 6 For  $|a| = 1000$  we find  $\langle a^{140} \rangle, \langle a^{400} \rangle, \langle a^{62} \rangle$  and  $|a^{140}|, |a^{400}|$ , and  $|a^{62}|$ . Since  $\gcd(1000, 140) = \gcd(2^35^3, 2^25 \cdot 7) = 2^25 = 20$  we have  $\langle a^{140} \rangle = \langle a^{20} \rangle = \{e, a^{20}, a^{40}, a^{60}, \ldots, a^{980}\}$  and  $|a^{140}| = |a^{20}| = 1000 / 20 = 50$ . Since  $\gcd(1000, 400) = \gcd(2^35^3, 2^45^2) = 2^35^2 = 200$  we have  $\langle a^{400} \rangle = \langle a^{200} \rangle = \{e, a^{200}, a^{400}, a^{600}, a^{800}\}$  and  $|a^{400}| = |a^{200}| = 1000 / 200 = 5$ . Since  $\gcd(1000, 62) = (2^35^3, 2 \cdot 31) = 2$  we have  $\langle a^{62} \rangle = \langle a^2 \rangle = \{e, a^2, a^4, a^6, \ldots, a^{998}\}$  and  $|a^{62}| = |a^2| = 1000 / 2 = 500$ .

Theorem 4.2 establishes an important relationship between the order of an element in a finite cyclic group and the order of the group.

# ■ Corollary 1 Orders of Elements in Finite Cyclic Groups

In a finite cyclic group, the order of an element divides the order of the group.

# Corollary 2 Criterion for  $\langle a^i\rangle = \langle a^j\rangle$  and  $|a^i | = |a^j |$

Let  $|a| = n$ . Then  $\langle a^i\rangle = \langle a^j\rangle$  if and only if  $\gcd (n,i) = \gcd (n,j)$ , and  $|a^i| = |a^j|$  if and only if  $\gcd (n,i) = \gcd (n,j)$ .

PROOF Theorem 4.2 shows that  $\langle a^i\rangle = \langle a^{\gcd (n,i)}\rangle$  and  $\langle a^{j}\rangle = \langle a^{\gcd (n,j)}\rangle$  so that the proof reduces to proving that  $\langle a^{\gcd (n,i)}\rangle = \langle a^{\gcd (n,j)}\rangle$  if and only if  $\gcd (n,i) = \gcd (n,j)$ . Certainly,  $\gcd (n,i) = \gcd (n,j)$  implies that  $\langle a^{\gcd (n,i)}\rangle = \langle a^{\gcd (n,j)}\rangle$ . On the other hand,  $\langle a^{\gcd (n,i)}\rangle = \langle a^{\gcd (n,j)}\rangle$  implies that  $|a^{\gcd (n,i)}| = |a^{\gcd (n,j)}|$ , so that by the second conclusion of Theorem 4.2, we have  $n / \gcd (n,i) = n / \gcd (n,j)$ , and therefore  $\gcd (n,i)) = \gcd (n,j)$ .

The second part of the corollary follows from the first part and Corollary 1 of Theorem 4.1.

The next two corollaries are important special cases of the preceding corollary.

# ■ Corollary 3 Generators of Finite Cyclic Groups

Let  $|a| = n$ . Then  $\langle a \rangle = \langle a^j \rangle$  if and only if  $\gcd(n, j) = 1$ , and  $|a| = |\langle a^j \rangle|$  if and only if  $\gcd(n, j) = 1$ .

# Corollary 4 Generators of  $Z_{n}$

An integer  $k$  in  $Z_{n}$  is a generator of  $Z_{n}$  if and only if  $\gcd(n, k) = 1$ .

The value of Corollary 3 is that once one generator of a cyclic group has been found, all generators of the cyclic group can easily be determined. For example, consider the subgroup of all rotations in  $D_6$ . Clearly, one generator is  $R_{60}$ . And, since  $|R_{60}| = 6$ , we see by Corollary 3 that the only other generator is  $(R_{60})^5 = R_{300}$ . Of course, we could have readily deduced this information without the aid of Corollary 3 by direct calculations. So, to illustrate the real power of Corollary 3, let us use it to find all generators of the cyclic group  $U(50)$ . First, note that direct computations show that  $|U(50)| = 20$  and that 3 is one of its generators. Thus, in view of Corollary 3, the complete list of generators for  $U(50)$  is

3 mod  $50 = 3$ $3^{11}$  mod  $50 = 47$  
$3^{3}$  mod  $50 = 27$ $3^{13}$  mod  $50 = 23$  
$3^{7}$  mod  $50 = 37$ $3^{17}$  mod  $50 = 13$  
$3^{9}$  mod  $50 = 33$ $3^{19}$  mod  $50 = 17$

Admittedly, we had to do some arithmetic here, but it certainly entailed much less work than finding all the generators by simply determining the order of each element of  $U(50)$  one by one.

The reader should keep in mind that Theorem 4.2 and its corollaries apply only to elements of finite order.

# Classification of Subgroups of Cyclic Groups

The next theorem tells us how many subgroups a finite cyclic group has and how to find them.

# Theorem 4.3 Fundamental Theorem of Cyclic Groups

Every subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic. Moreover, if  $|\langle a \rangle| = n$ , then the order of any subgroup of  $\langle a \rangle$  is a divisor of  $n$ ; and, for each positive divisor  $k$  of  $n$ , the group  $\langle a \rangle$  has exactly one subgroup of order  $k$ —namely,  $\langle a^{n / k} \rangle$ .

Before we prove this theorem, let's see what it means. Understanding what a theorem means is a prerequisite to understanding its proof. Suppose  $G = \langle a \rangle$  and  $G$  has order 30. The first and second parts of the theorem say that if  $H$  is any subgroup of  $G$ , then  $H$  has the form  $\langle a^{30/k} \rangle$  for some  $k$  that is a divisor of 30. The third part of the theorem says that  $G$  has one subgroup of each of the orders 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30—and no others. The proof will also show how to find these subgroups.

PROOF Let  $G = \langle a \rangle$  and suppose that  $H$  is a subgroup of  $G$ . We must show that  $H$  is cyclic. If it consists of the identity alone, then clearly  $H$  is cyclic. So we may assume that  $H \neq \{e\}$ . We now claim that  $H$  contains an element of the form  $a^t$ , where  $t$  is positive. Since  $G = \langle a \rangle$ , every element of  $H$  has the form  $a^t$ ; and when  $a^t$  belongs to  $H$  with  $t < 0$ , then  $a^{-t}$  belongs to  $H$ .

also and  $-t$  is positive. Thus, our claim is verified. Now let  $m$  be the least positive integer such that  $a^m \in H$ . By closure,  $\langle a^m \rangle \subseteq H$ . We next claim that  $H = \langle a^m \rangle$ . To prove this claim, it suffices to let  $b$  be an arbitrary member of  $H$  and show that  $b$  is in  $\langle a^m \rangle$ . Since  $b \in G = \langle a \rangle$ , we have  $b = a^k$  for some  $k$ . Now, apply the division algorithm to  $k$  and  $m$  to obtain integers  $q$  and  $r$  such that  $k = mq + r$  where  $0 \leq r < m$ . Then  $a^k = a^{mq + r} = a^{mq}a^r$ , so that  $a^r = a^{-mq}a^k$ . Since  $a^k = b \in H$  and  $a^{-mq} = (a^m)^{-q}$  is in  $H$  also,  $a^r \in H$ . But,  $m$  is the least positive integer such that  $a^m \in H$ , and  $0 \leq r < m$ , so  $r$  must be 0. Therefore,  $b = a^k = a^{mq} = (a^m)^q \in \langle a^m \rangle$ . This proves the assertion of the theorem that every subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic.

To prove the next part of the theorem, suppose that  $|\langle a\rangle| = n$  and  $H$  is any subgroup of  $\langle a\rangle$ . By the argument in the preceding paragraph and Theorem 4.2 we know that  $H$  is cyclic and has the form  $\langle a^m\rangle$  where  $m$  divides  $n$  and  $|a^m| = n / m$ . Finally, observe that if  $k$  is any positive divisor of  $n$  then  $|\langle a^{n / k}\rangle| = k$  and if  $K$  is any subgroup of  $\langle a\rangle$  of order  $k$  then  $K$  has the form  $\langle a^s\rangle$  where  $s$  divides  $n$  and  $|\langle a^s\rangle| = n / s = k$ . So,  $s = n / k$ .

Returning for a moment to our discussion of the cyclic group  $\langle a\rangle$ , where  $a$  has order 30, we may conclude from Theorem 4.3 that the subgroups of  $\langle a\rangle$  are precisely those of the form  $\langle a^m\rangle$ , where  $m$  is a divisor of 30. Moreover, if  $k$  is a divisor of 30, the subgroup of order  $k$  is  $\langle a^{30 / k}\rangle$ . So the list of subgroups of  $\langle a\rangle$  is:

$$
\langle a \rangle = \{e, a, a ^ {2}, \dots , a ^ {2 9} \} \quad \text {o r d e r} 3 0,
$$

$$
\langle a ^ {2} \rangle = \{e, a ^ {2}, a ^ {4}, \dots , a ^ {2 8} \} \quad \text {o r d e r} 1 5,
$$

$$
\langle a ^ {3} \rangle = \{e, a ^ {3}, a ^ {6}, \dots , a ^ {2 7} \} \quad \text {o r d e r} 1 0,
$$

$$
\langle a ^ {5} \rangle = \{e, a ^ {5}, a ^ {1 0}, a ^ {1 5}, a ^ {2 0}, a ^ {2 5} \} \quad \text {o r d e r} 6,
$$

$$
\langle a ^ {6} \rangle = \{e, a ^ {6}, a ^ {1 2}, a ^ {1 8}, a ^ {2 4} \} \quad \text {o r d e r} 5,
$$

$$
\langle a ^ {1 0} \rangle = \{e, a ^ {1 0}, a ^ {2 0} \} \quad \text {o r d e r} 3,
$$

$$
\langle a ^ {1 5} \rangle = \{e, a ^ {1 5} \} \quad \text {o r d e r} 2,
$$

$$
\langle a ^ {3 0} \rangle = \{e \} \quad \text {o r d e r} 1.
$$

In general, if  $\langle a\rangle$  has order  $n$  and  $k$  divides  $n$ , then  $\langle a^{n / k}\rangle$  is the unique subgroup of order  $k$ .

Taking the group in Theorem 4.3 to be  $Z_{n}$  and  $a$  to be 1, we obtain the following important special case.

# Corollary Subgroups of  $Z_{n}$

For each positive divisor  $k$  of  $n$ , the set  $\langle n / k \rangle$  is the unique subgroup of  $Z_{n}$  of order  $k$ ; moreover, these are the only subgroups of  $Z_{n}$ .

EXAMPLE 7 The list of subgroups of  $Z_{30}$  is

$\langle 1\rangle$ $\{0,1,2,\ldots ,29\}$  order30,  
$\langle 2\rangle$ $\{0,2,4,\ldots ,28\}$  order 15,  
$\langle 3\rangle$ $\{0,3,6,\ldots ,27\}$  order 10,  
$\langle 5\rangle$ $\{0,5,10,15,20,25\}$  order6,  
$\langle 6\rangle$ $\{0,6,12,18,24\}$  order 5,  
$\langle 10\rangle$ $\begin{array}{rl}{=}&{\{0,10,20\}}\end{array}$  order3,  
$\langle 15\rangle$ $\equiv \{0,15\}$  order2,  
$\langle 30\rangle$ $\begin{array}{rlr}{=}&{\{0\}}&{}\\{}&{}&{\mathrm{order}~1.}\end{array}$

Theorems 4.2 and 4.3 provide a simple way to find all the generators of the subgroups of a finite cyclic group.

EXAMPLE 8 To find the generators of the subgroup of order 9 in  $Z_{36}$ , we observe that  $36 / 9 = 4$  is one generator. To find the others, we have from Corollary 3 of Theorem 4.2 that they are all elements of  $Z_{36}$  of the form  $4j$ , where  $\gcd(9, j) = 1$ . Thus,

$$
\langle 4 \cdot 1 \rangle = \langle 4 \cdot 2 \rangle = \langle 4 \cdot 4 \rangle = \langle 4 \cdot 5 \rangle = \langle 4 \cdot 7 \rangle = \langle 4 \cdot 8 \rangle .
$$

In the generic case, to find all the subgroups of  $\langle a\rangle$  of order 9 where  $|a| = 36$ , we have

$$
\langle (a ^ {4}) ^ {1} \rangle = \langle (a ^ {4}) ^ {2} \rangle = \langle (a ^ {4}) ^ {4} \rangle = \langle (a ^ {4}) ^ {5} \rangle = \langle (a ^ {4}) ^ {7} \rangle = \langle (a ^ {4}) ^ {8} \rangle .
$$

In particular, note that once you have the generator  $a^{n / d}$  for the subgroup of order  $d$  where  $d$  is a divisor of  $|a| = n$ , all the generators of  $\langle a^d \rangle$  have the form  $(a^d)^j$  where  $j \in U(d)$ .

By combining Theorems 4.2 and 4.3, we can easily count the number of elements of each order in a finite cyclic group. For convenience, we introduce an important number-theoretic function called the Euler phi function. Let  $\phi(1) = 1$ , and for any integer  $n > 1$ , let  $\phi(n)$  denote the number of positive integers less than  $n$  and relatively prime to  $n$ . Notice that by definition of the group  $U(n)$ ,  $|U(n)| = \phi(n)$ . The first 12 values of  $\phi(n)$  are given in Table 4.1.

# Theorem 4.4 Number of Elements of Each Order in a Cyclic Group

If  $d$  is a positive divisor of  $n$ , the number of elements of order  $d$  in a cyclic group of order  $n$  is  $\phi(d)$ .

PROOF By Theorem 4.3, the group has exactly one subgroup of order  $d$  — call it  $\langle a \rangle$ . Then every element of order  $d$  also generates the subgroup  $\langle a \rangle$  and, by Corollary 3 of Theorem 4.2, an element  $a^k$  generates  $\langle a \rangle$  if and only if  $\gcd(k, d) = 1$ . The number of such elements is precisely  $\phi(d)$ .

Notice that for a finite cyclic group of order  $n$ , the number of elements of order  $d$  for any divisor  $d$  of  $n$  depends only on  $d$ . Thus,  $Z_{8}, Z_{640}$ , and  $Z_{80000}$  each have  $\phi(8) = 4$  elements of order 8.

Although there is no formula for the number of elements of each order for arbitrary finite groups, we still can say something important in this regard.

# Corollary 4.1 Number of Elements of Order  $d$  in a Finite Group

In a finite group, the number of elements of order  $d$  is a multiple of  $\phi(d)$ .

PROOF If a finite group has no elements of order  $d$ , the statement is true, since  $\phi(d)$  divides 0. Now suppose that  $a \in G$  and  $|a| = d$ . By Theorem 4.4, we know that  $\langle a \rangle$  has  $\phi(d)$  elements of order  $d$ . If all elements of order  $d$  in  $G$  are in  $\langle a \rangle$ , we are done. So, suppose that there is an element  $b$  in  $G$  of order  $d$  that is not in  $\langle a \rangle$ . Then,  $\langle b \rangle$  also has  $\phi(d)$  elements of order  $d$ . This means that we have found  $2\phi(d)$  elements of order  $d$  in  $G$  provided that  $\langle a \rangle$  and  $\langle b \rangle$  have no elements of order  $d$  in common. If there is an element  $c$  of order  $d$  that belongs to both  $\langle a \rangle$  and  $\langle b \rangle$ , then we have  $\langle a \rangle = \langle c \rangle = \langle b \rangle$ , so that  $b \in \langle a \rangle$ , which is a contradiction. Continuing in this fashion, we see that the number of elements of order  $d$  in a finite group is a multiple of  $\phi(d)$ .

Theorem 4.4 together with the two number theory properties that for any prime  $p$ ,  $\phi(p^n) = p^n - p^{n-1}$  (see Exercise 85), and  $\phi(p_1^{k_1}p_2^{k_2}\dots p_m^{k_m}) = \phi(p_1^{k_1})\phi(p_2^{k_2})\dots \phi(p_m^{k_m})$  for distinct primes  $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_m$ , greatly simplify the task of determining orders of element in  $U(n)$  and whether or not  $U(n)$  is cyclic.

Say we wanted to determine if  $U(25)$  is cyclic. Since  $\phi(25) = \phi(5^2)$ , we know that  $|U(25)| = (5^2 - 5) = 20$ . So, the definition of a cyclic group requires that we show that some element  $a$  in  $U(25)$  has the two properties:  $a^{20} = e$  and  $a^k \neq e$  for all integers  $k$  between 1 and 19. The next example shows that we need only check that  $a^{20} = e$  and  $a^k \neq e$  for some integers  $k$  between 1 and 19. See Exercise 7 for the general case.

EXAMPLE 9 Consider the element 2 in  $U(25)$  as a possible element of order 20. From  $2^5 = 7 \mod 25$ , we have  $2^{10} = 7 \cdot 7 = 24 = -1 \mod 25$ , and therefore  $2^{20} = 1 \mod 25$ . So, by Corollary 2 of Theorem 4.1, we have that  $|2|$  is a divisor of 20. By observation, 1, 2, and 4 are not possible orders. Moreover,  $2^{10} = -1 \mod 25$  rules out 5 and 10 as possible orders. Thus,  $|2| = 20$  and  $U(25) = \langle 2 \rangle$ .

Likewise, to find  $|2|$  in  $U(13)$ , which has order 12, we note that  $2^6 = 64 = 12 = -1 \mod 13$  implies that  $|2|$  divides 12. So, by Corollary 2 of Theorem 4.1 once again, the possible orders of 2 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. But  $2^6 = 12$  excludes 1, 2, 3, and 6, whereas  $2^4 = 3$  excludes 4. So,  $U(13) = \langle 2 \rangle$  and is cyclic.

On the other hand, for  $U(n)$  ( $n > 2$ ) to be cyclic, we have from Theorem 4.3 that  $n - 1 = -1 \mod n$  must be the unique element of order 2 in  $U(n)$ . But, because  $9^2 = 1$  in  $U(80)$ , and  $11^2 = 1$  in  $U(120)$ , neither is cyclic. Notice that we did not even have to know the orders of  $U(80)$  and  $U(120)$  to determine that they weren't cyclic.

In Chapter 8 we will give a complete classification of  $U$ -groups which are cyclic.

The relationships among the various subgroups of a group can be illustrated with a subgroup lattice of the group. This is a diagram that includes all the subgroups of the group and connects a subgroup  $H$  at one level to a subgroup  $K$  at a higher level with a sequence of line segments if and only if  $H$  is a proper subgroup of  $K$ . Although there are many ways to draw such a diagram, the connections between the subgroups must be the same. Typically, one attempts to present the diagram in an eye-pleasing fashion. The lattice diagram for  $Z_{30}$  is shown in Figure 4.2. Notice that  $\langle 10 \rangle$  is a subgroup of both  $\langle 2 \rangle$  and  $\langle 5 \rangle$ , but  $\langle 6 \rangle$  is not a subgroup of  $\langle 10 \rangle$ .

Figure 4.2 Subgroup lattice of  $Z_{30}$ .

The precision of Theorem 4.3 can be appreciated by comparing the ease with which we are able to identify the subgroups of  $Z_{30}$  with that of doing the same for, say,  $U(30)$  or  $D_{30}$ . And these groups have relatively simple structures among noncyclic groups.

We will prove in Chapter 7 that a certain portion of Theorem 4.3 extends to arbitrary finite groups; namely, the order of a subgroup divides the order of the group itself. We will also see, however, that a finite group need not have exactly one subgroup corresponding to each divisor of the order of the group. For some divisors, there may be none at all, whereas for other divisors, there may be many. Indeed,  $D_4$ , the dihedral group of order 8, has five subgroups of order 2 and three of order 4.

One final remark about the importance of cyclic groups is appropriate. Although cyclic groups constitute a very narrow class of finite groups, we will see in Chapter 11 that they play the role of building blocks for all finite Abelian

groups in much the same way that primes are the building blocks for the integers and that chemical elements are the building blocks for the chemical compounds.

JAMES JOSEPH SYLVESTER was the most influential mathematician in America in the 19th century. Sylvester was born on September 3, 1814, in London and showed his mathematical genius early. At the age of 14, he studied under De Morgan and won several prizes for his mathematics, and at the unusually young age of 25, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society.

After receiving B.A. and M.A. degrees from Trinity College in Dublin in 1841, Sylvester began a professional life that was to include academics, law, and actuarial careers. In 1876, at the age of 62, he was appointed to a prestigious position at the newly founded Johns Hopkins University. During his seven years at Johns Hopkins, Sylvester pursued research in pure mathematics with tremendous vigor and enthusiasm.

He also founded the American Journal of Mathematics, the first journal in America devoted to mathematical research. Sylvester returned to England in 1884 to a professorship at Oxford, a position he held until his death on March 15, 1897. Sylvester's major contributions to mathematics were in the theory of equations, matrix theory, determinant theory, and invariant theory (which he founded with Cayley. His writings and lectures—flowery and eloquent, pervaded with poetic flights, emotional expressions, bizarre utterances, and paradoxes—reflected the personality of this sensitive, excitable, and enthusiastic man.

# Definitions and Notation

At this point we know two families of finite Abelian groups,  $Z_{n}$  and  $U(n)$ , and two families of infinite non-Abelian groups, dihedral groups and matrix groups. In this chapter we introduce a family of non-Abelian groups of certain functions called permutation groups from a set  $A$  to itself. In the early and mid-19th century, groups of permutations were the only groups investigated by mathematicians. It was not until around 1850 that the notion of an abstract group was introduced by Cayley, and it took another quarter century before the idea firmly took hold. Permutation groups are important in the theory of groups and in computer science, physics, and chemistry.

# Definitions Permutation of  $A$ , Permutation Group of  $A$

A permutation of a set  $A$  is a function from  $A$  to  $A$  that is both one-to-one and onto. A permutation group of a set  $A$  is a set of permutations of  $A$  that forms a group under function composition.

Although groups of permutations of any nonempty set  $A$  of objects exist, we will focus on the case where  $A$  is finite. Furthermore, it is customary, as well as convenient, to take  $A$  to be a set of the form  $\{1,2,3,\dots,n\}$  for some positive integer  $n$ . Unlike in calculus, where most functions are defined on infinite sets and are given by formulas, in algebra, permutations of finite sets are usually given by an explicit listing of each element of the domain and its corresponding functional value. For example, we define a permutation  $\alpha$  of the set  $\{1,2,3,4\}$  by specifying

$$
\alpha (1) = 2, \quad \alpha (2) = 3, \quad \alpha (3) = 1, \quad \alpha (4) = 4.
$$

A more convenient way to express this correspondence is to write  $\alpha$  in array form as

$$
\alpha = \left[ \begin{array}{c c c c} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ 2 & 3 & 1 & 4 \end{array} \right].
$$

Here  $\alpha(j)$  is placed directly below  $j$  for each  $j$ . Similarly, the permutation  $\beta$  of the set  $\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$  given by

$$
\beta (1) = 5, \quad \beta (2) = 3, \quad \beta (3) = 1, \quad \beta (4) = 6, \quad \beta (5) = 2, \quad \beta (6) = 4
$$

is expressed in array form as

$$
\beta = \left[ \begin{array}{c c c c c c} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\ 5 & 3 & 1 & 6 & 2 & 4 \end{array} \right].
$$

Composition of permutations expressed in array notation is carried out from right to left by going from top to bottom, then again from top to bottom. For example, let

$$
\sigma = \left[ \begin{array}{c c c c c} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\ 2 & 4 & 3 & 5 & 1 \end{array} \right]
$$

and

$$
\gamma = \left[ \begin{array}{c c c c c} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\ 5 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 3 \end{array} \right],
$$

then

$$
\gamma \sigma = \left[ \begin{array}{c c c c c} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\ & \downarrow & & & \\ 5 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 3 \end{array} \right] \cdot \left[ \begin{array}{c c c c c} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\ & \downarrow & & & \\ 2 & 4 & 3 & 5 & 1 \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c c c c c} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\ 4 & 2 & 1 & 3 & 5 \end{array} \right]
$$

On the right we have 4 under 1, since  $(\gamma \sigma)(1) = \gamma (\sigma (1)) = \gamma (2) = 4$  so  $\gamma \sigma$  sends 1 to 4. The remainder of the bottom row  $\gamma \sigma$  is obtained in a similar fashion.

We are now ready to give some examples of permutation groups.

EXAMPLE 1 Symmetric Group  $S_{3}$  Let  $S_{3}$  denote the set of all one-to-one functions from  $\{1,2,3\}$  to itself. Then  $S_{3}$ , under function composition, is a group with six elements. The six elements are

$$
\varepsilon = \left[ \begin{array}{c c c} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \end{array} \right], \quad \alpha = \left[ \begin{array}{c c c} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 2 & 3 & 1 \end{array} \right], \quad \alpha^ {2} = \left[ \begin{array}{c c c} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 3 & 1 & 2 \end{array} \right],
$$

$$
\beta = \left[ \begin{array}{c c c} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 1 & 3 & 2 \end{array} \right], \quad \alpha \beta = \left[ \begin{array}{c c c} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 2 & 1 & 3 \end{array} \right], \quad \alpha^ {2} \beta = \left[ \begin{array}{c c c} 1 & 2 & 3 \\ 3 & 2 & 1 \end{array} \right].
$$

Note that  $\beta \alpha = \left[ \begin{array}{lll}1 & 2 & 3\\ 3 & 2 & 1 \end{array} \right] = \alpha^2\beta \neq \alpha \beta$  so that  $S_{3}$  is non-Abelian.

The relation  $\beta \alpha = \alpha^2\beta$  can be used to compute other products in  $S_{3}$  without resorting to the arrays. For example,  $\beta \alpha^{2} = (\beta \alpha)\alpha = (\alpha^{2}\beta)\alpha = \alpha^{2}(\beta \alpha) = \alpha^{2}(\alpha^{2}\beta) = \alpha^{4}\beta = \alpha \beta$ .

Example 1 can be generalized as follows.

EXAMPLE 2 Symmetric Group  $S_{n}$  Let  $A = \{1,2,\dots,n\}$ . The set of all permutations of  $A$  is called the symmetric group of degree  $n$  and is denoted by  $S_{n}$ . Elements of  $S_{n}$  have the form

$$
\alpha = \left[ \begin{array}{c c c c} 1 & 2 & \dots & n \\ \alpha (1) & \alpha (2) & \dots & \alpha (n) \end{array} \right].
$$

It is easy to compute the order of  $S_{n}$ . There are  $n$  choices of  $\alpha(1)$ . Once  $\alpha(1)$  has been determined, there are  $n - 1$  possibilities for  $\alpha(2)$  [since  $\alpha$  is one-to-one, we must have  $\alpha(1) \neq \alpha(2)$ ]. After choosing  $\alpha(2)$ , there are exactly  $n - 2$  possibilities for  $\alpha(3)$ . Continuing along in this fashion, we see that  $S_{n}$  has  $n(n - 1) \cdots 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = n!$  elements. We leave it to the reader to prove that  $S_{n}$  is non-Abelian when  $n \geq 3$  (Exercise 51).

The symmetric groups are rich in subgroups. The group  $S_4$  has 30 subgroups, and  $S_5$  has well over 100 subgroups.

EXAMPLE 3 Symmetries of a Square As a third example, we associate each motion in  $D_4$  with the permutation of the locations of each of the four corners of a square. For example, if we label the four corner positions as in the figure below and keep these labels fixed for reference, we may describe a  $90^\circ$  counterclockwise rotation by the permutation

![](images/033c06028a3c1ea2f755b909d3ddf70117a25a108618072eb5acbcf5621e222f.jpg)

$$
\rho = \left[ \begin{array}{c c c c} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ 2 & 3 & 4 & 1 \end{array} \right],
$$

whereas a reflection across a horizontal axis yields

$$
\phi = \left[ \begin{array}{c c c c} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ 2 & 1 & 4 & 3 \end{array} \right].
$$

These two elements generate the entire group (i.e., every element is some combination of the  $\rho$ 's and  $\phi$ 's).

When  $D_4$  is represented in this way, we see that it is a subgroup of  $S_4$ .

# Cycle Notation

There is another notation commonly used to specify permutations. It is called cycle notation and was first introduced by the great French mathematician Cauchy in 1815. Cycle notation has theoretical advantages in that certain important properties of the permutation can be readily determined when cycle notation is used.

As an illustration of cycle notation, let us consider the permutation

$$
\alpha = \left[ \begin{array}{c c c c c c} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\ 2 & 1 & 4 & 6 & 5 & 3 \end{array} \right].
$$

This assignment of values could be presented schematically as follows.

![](images/1fcf285397bb1d1628abbb8b8a88d2d17668b22ea6997f5f44406a6dfad88c6b.jpg)

![](images/a02b716c798b4d78d32aa873b97dfa6232eb2de06ef6594d9115d2357134af9e.jpg)

Although mathematically satisfactory, such diagrams are cumbersome. Instead, we leave out the arrows and simply write  $\alpha = (1,2)(3,4,6)(5)$ . As a second example, consider

$$
\beta = \left[ \begin{array}{c c c c c c} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\ 5 & 3 & 1 & 6 & 2 & 4 \end{array} \right].
$$

In cycle notation,  $\beta$  can be written (2, 3, 1, 5)(6, 4) or (4, 6)(3, 1, 5, 2), since both of these unambiguously specify the function  $\beta$ . An expression of the form  $(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{m})$  is called a cycle of length  $m$  or an  $m$ -cycle.

A multiplication of cycles can be introduced by thinking of a cycle as a permutation that fixes any symbol not appearing in the cycle. Thus, the cycle (4, 6) can be thought of as representing the permutation  $\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\ 1 & 2 & 3 & 6 & 5 & 4 \end{bmatrix}$ .

In this way, we can multiply cycles by thinking of them as permutations given in array form. Consider the following example from  $S_8$ . Let  $\alpha = (13)(27)(456)(8)$  and  $\beta = (1237)(648)(5)$ . (When the domain consists of single-digit integers, it is common practice to omit the commas between the digits.) What is the cycle form of  $\alpha \beta$ ? Of course, one could say that  $\alpha \beta = (13)(27)(456)(8)(1237)(648)(5)$ , but it is usually more desirable to express a permutation in a disjoint cycle form (i.e., the various cycles have no number in common). We proceed by treating each of the seven cycles of  $\alpha \beta$  as a function from the set  $\{1, 2, \ldots, 8\}$  to itself and use function composition, keeping in mind that function composition is done from right to left and that each cycle that does not contain a symbol fixes that symbol. So let's see what we get for  $(\alpha \beta)(1)$ . We observe that (5) fixes 1, then (648) fixes 1, then (1237) sends 1 to 2, then (8) fixes 2, then (456) fixes 2, then (27) sends 2 to 7, and, lastly, (13) fixes 7. So the net effect of  $\alpha \beta$  is to send 1 to 7. Thus, we begin with  $\alpha \beta = (17 \cdots) \cdots$ . Pictorially, we see

$$
1 \xrightarrow {(5)} 1 \xrightarrow {(6 4 8)} 1 \xrightarrow {(1 2 3 7)} 2 \xrightarrow {(8)} 2 \xrightarrow {(4 5 6)} 2 \xrightarrow {(2 7)} 7 \xrightarrow {(1 3)} 7.
$$

Now, repeating the entire process beginning with 7, we have, cycle by cycle, right to left,

$$
7 \xrightarrow {(5)} 7 \xrightarrow {(6 4 8)} 7 \xrightarrow {(1 2 3 7)} 1 \xrightarrow {(8)} 1 \xrightarrow {(4 5 6)} 1 \xrightarrow {(2 7)} 1 \xrightarrow {(1 3)} 3,
$$

so that  $\alpha \beta = (173\cdots)\cdots$ . Ultimately, we have  $\alpha \beta = (1732)(48)(56)$ . The important thing to bear in mind when multiplying cycles is to "keep moving" from one cycle to the next from right to left. (Warning: Some authors compose cycles from left to right. When reading another text, be sure to determine which convention is being used.)

To be sure you understand how to switch from one notation to the other and how to multiply permutations, we will do one more example of each.

If array notations for  $\alpha$  and  $\beta$ , respectively, are

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{c c c c c} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\ 2 & 1 & 3 & 5 & 4 \end{array} \right] \quad \text {a n d} \quad \left[ \begin{array}{c c c c c} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\ 5 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 3 \end{array} \right],
$$

then, in cycle notation,  $\alpha = (12)(3)(45),\beta = (153)(24)$  , and  $\alpha \beta =$  (12)(3)(45)(153)(24).

To put  $\alpha \beta$  in disjoint cycle form, observe that (24) fixes 1; (153) sends 1 to 5; (45) sends 5 to 4; and (3) and (12) both fix 4. So,  $\alpha \beta$  sends 1 to 4. Continuing in this way we obtain  $\alpha \beta = (14)(253)$ .

One can convert  $\alpha \beta$  back to array form without converting each cycle of  $\alpha \beta$  into array form by simply observing that (14) means 1 goes to 4 and 4 goes to 1; (253) means  $2 \rightarrow 5, 5 \rightarrow 3, 3 \rightarrow 2$ .

One final remark about cycle notation: Mathematicians prefer not to write cycles that have only one entry. In this case, it is understood that any missing element is mapped to itself. With this convention, the permutation  $\alpha$  above can be written as (12)(45). Similarly,

$$
\alpha = \left[ \begin{array}{c c c c c} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\ 3 & 2 & 4 & 1 & 5 \end{array} \right]
$$

can be written  $\alpha = (134)$ . Of course, the identity permutation consists only of cycles with one entry, so we cannot omit all of these! In this case, one usually writes just one cycle. For example,

$$
\varepsilon = \left[ \begin{array}{c c c c c} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\ 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \end{array} \right]
$$

can be written as  $\varepsilon = (5)$  or  $\varepsilon = (1)$ . Just remember that missing elements are mapped to themselves.

# Properties of Permutations

We are now ready to state several theorems about permutations and cycles. The proof of the first theorem is implicit in our discussion of writing permutations in cycle form.

# Theorem 5.1 Products of Disjoint Cycles

Every permutation of a finite set can be written as a cycle or as a product of disjoint cycles.

PROOF Let  $\alpha$  be a permutation on  $A = \{1,2,\ldots ,n\}$ . To write  $\alpha$  in disjoint cycle form, we start by choosing any member of  $A$ , say  $a_1$ , and let

$$
a _ {2} = \alpha (a _ {1}), \quad a _ {3} = \alpha (\alpha (a _ {1})) = \alpha^ {2} (a _ {1}),
$$

and so on, until we arrive at  $a_1 = \alpha^m(a_1)$  for some  $m$ . We know that such an  $m$  exists because the sequence  $a_1, \alpha(a_1), \alpha^2(a_1), \ldots$  must be finite; so there must eventually be a repetition, say  $\alpha^i(a_1) = \alpha^j(a_1)$  for some  $i$  and  $j$  with  $i < j$ . Then  $a_1 = \alpha^m(a_1)$ , where  $m = j - i$ . We express this relationship among  $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_m$  as

$$
\alpha = \left(a _ {1}, a _ {2}, \dots , a _ {m}\right) \dots .
$$

The three dots at the end indicate the possibility that we may not have exhausted the set  $A$  in this process. In such a case, we merely choose any element  $b_{1}$  of  $A$  not appearing in the first cycle and proceed to create a new cycle as before. That is, we let  $b_{2} = \alpha(b_{1}), b_{3} = \alpha^{2}(b_{1})$ , and so on, until we reach  $b_{1} = \alpha^{k}(b_{1})$  for some  $k$ . This new cycle will have no elements in common with the previously constructed cycle. For, if so, then  $\alpha^{i}(a_{1}) = \alpha^{j}(b_{1})$  for some  $i$  and  $j$ . But then  $\alpha^{i-j}(a_{1}) = b_{1}$ , and therefore  $b_{1} = a_{t}$  for some  $t$ . This contradicts the way  $b_{1}$  was chosen. Continuing this process until we run out of elements of  $A$ , our permutation will appear as

$$
\alpha = \left(a _ {1}, a _ {2}, \dots , a _ {m}\right) \left(b _ {1}, b _ {2}, \dots , b _ {k}\right) \dots \left(c _ {1}, c _ {2}, \dots , c _ {s}\right).
$$

In this way, we see that every permutation can be written as a product of disjoint cycles.

# Theorem 5.2 Disjoint Cycles Commute

$$
\begin{array}{l} \text {I f t h e p a i r o f c y c l e s} \alpha = (a _ {1}, a _ {2}, \dots , a _ {m}) \text {a n d} \beta = \\ (b _ {1}, b _ {2}, \dots , b _ {n}) \text {h a v e n o e n t r i e s i n c o m m o n , t h e n} \alpha \beta = \beta \alpha . \end{array}
$$

PROOF For definiteness, let us say that  $\alpha$  and  $\beta$  are permutations of the set

$$
S = \left\{a _ {1}, a _ {2}, \dots , a _ {m}, b _ {1}, b _ {2}, \dots , b _ {n}, c _ {1}, c _ {2}, \dots , c _ {k} \right\},
$$

where the  $c$ 's are the members of  $S$  left fixed by both  $\alpha$  and  $\beta$  (there may not be any  $c$ 's). To prove that  $\alpha \beta = \beta \alpha$ , we must show that  $(\alpha \beta)(x) = (\beta \alpha)(x)$  for all  $x$  in  $S$ . If  $x$  is one of the  $a$  elements, say  $a_i$ , then

$$
(\alpha \beta) (a _ {i}) = \alpha (\beta (a _ {i})) = \alpha (a _ {i}) = a _ {i + 1},
$$

since  $\beta$  fixes all  $a$  elements. (We interpret  $a_{i+1}$  as  $a_1$  if  $i = m$ .) For the same reason,

$$
(\beta \alpha) (a _ {i}) = \beta (\alpha (a _ {i})) = \beta (a _ {i + 1}) = a _ {i + 1}.
$$

Hence, the functions of  $\alpha \beta$  and  $\beta \alpha$  agree on the  $a$  elements. A similar argument shows that  $\alpha \beta$  and  $\beta \alpha$  agree on the  $b$  elements as well. Finally, suppose

that  $x$  is a  $c$  element, say  $c_{i}$ . Then, since both  $\alpha$  and  $\beta$  fix  $c$  elements, we have

$$
(\alpha \beta) (c _ {i}) = \alpha (\beta (c _ {i})) = \alpha (c _ {i}) = c _ {i}
$$

and

$$
(\beta \alpha) (c _ {i}) = \beta (\alpha (c _ {i})) = \beta (c _ {i}) = c _ {i}.
$$

This completes the proof.

In demonstrating how to multiply cycles, we showed that the product (13)(27)(456)(8) (1237)(648)(5) can be written in disjoint cycle form as (1732)(48)(56). Is economy in expression the only advantage to writing a permutation in disjoint cycle form? No. The next theorem shows that the disjoint cycle form has the enormous advantage of allowing us to "eyeball" the order of the permutation.

# Theorem 5.3 Order of a Permutation (Ruffini, 1799)

The order of a permutation of a finite set written in disjoint cycle form is the least common multiple of the lengths of the cycles.

PROOF First, observe that a cycle of length  $n$  has order  $n$ . (Verify this yourself.) Next, suppose that  $\alpha$  and  $\beta$  are disjoint cycles of lengths  $m$  and  $n$ , and let  $k$  be the least common multiple of  $m$  and  $n$ . It follows from Theorem 4.1 that both  $\alpha^k$  and  $\beta^k$  are the identity permutation  $\varepsilon$  and, since  $\alpha$  and  $\beta$  commute,  $(\alpha \beta)^k = \alpha^k\beta^k$  is also the identity. Thus, we know by Corollary 2 to Theorem 4.1  $(a^{k} = e$  implies that  $|a|$  divides  $k$ ) that the order of  $\alpha \beta$ —let us call it  $t$ —must divide  $k$ . But then  $(\alpha \beta)^{t} = \alpha^{t}\beta^{t} = \varepsilon$ . Since  $\alpha$  and  $\beta$  are disjoint we know that  $\alpha^t$  fixes the elements of  $\beta$  and  $\beta^t$  fixes the elements of  $\alpha$  and it follows that  $\alpha^t\beta^t$  fixes 1 through  $n$  only when both  $\alpha^t = \varepsilon$  and  $\beta^t = \varepsilon$ . But then  $t$  is a common multiple of  $m$  and  $n$ . Because  $k$  is the least common multiple of  $m$  and  $n$ , we then have  $k\leq t$ , which gives us that  $k = t$ .

Thus far, we have proved that the theorem is true in the cases where the permutation is a single cycle or a product of two disjoint cycles. The general case involving more than two cycles can be handled in an analogous way.

Theorem 5.3 is a powerful tool for calculating the orders of permutations and the number of permutations of a particular order. We demonstrate this in the next four examples.

# EXAMPLE 4

$|(132)(45)| = 6$  
$|(1432)(56)| = 4$  
$|(123)(456)(78)| = 6$  
$|(123)(145)| = |14523| = 5$

Arranging all possible disjoint cycle structures of elements of  $S_{n}$  according to the longest cycle lengths listed from left to right provides a systematic way of counting the number of elements in  $S_{n}$  of any particular order. There are

two cases: permutations where the lengths of the disjoint cycles (ignoring 1-cycles) are distinct and permutations where there are at least two disjoint cycles (ignoring 1-cycles) of the same length. The two cases are illustrated in Examples 5, 6, and 7.

EXAMPLE 5 To determine the orders of the  $7! = 5040$  elements of  $S_7$ , we need only consider the possible disjoint cycle structures of the elements of  $S_7$ . For convenience, we denote an  $n$ -cycle by  $(\underline{n})$ . Then, arranging all possible disjoint cycle structures of elements of  $S_7$  according to longest cycle lengths left to right, we have

(7)  
(6) (1)  
(5) (2)  
(5) (1) (1)  
(4) (3)  
(4) (2) (1)  
(4) (1) (1) (1)  
(3) (3) (1)  
(3) (2) (2)  
(3) (2) (1) (1)  
(3) (1) (1) (1) (1)  
(2) (2) (2) (1)  
(2) (2) (1) (1) (1)  
(2) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1)  
(1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).

Now, from Theorem 5.3 we see that the orders of the elements of  $S_7$  are 7, 6, 10, 5, 12, 4, 3, 2, and 1. To do the same for the  $10! = 3628800$  elements of  $S_{10}$  would be nearly as simple.

EXAMPLE 6 We determine the number of elements in  $S_7$  of order 12. By Theorems 5.2 and 5.3, we need only count the number of permutations with disjoint cycle form  $(a_1a_2a_3a_4)(a_5a_6a_7)$ . First consider the cycle  $(a_1a_2a_3a_4)$ . Although the number of ways to fill these slots is  $7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4$ , this product counts the cycle  $(a_1a_2a_3a_4)$  four times. For example, the 4-cycle (2741) can also be written as (7412), (4127), (1274) whereas the product  $7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4$  counts them as distinct. Likewise, the  $3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1$  expressions for  $(a_5a_6a_7)$  counts the cycles  $(a_5a_6a_7), (a_6a_7a_5)$  and  $(a_7a_5a_6)$  as distinct even though they are equal in  $S_7$ . Adjusting for these multiple countings, we have that there are  $(7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4)(3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1) / (4 \cdot 3) = 420$  elements of order 12 in  $S_7$ .

EXAMPLE 7 We determine the number of elements in  $S_7$  of order 3. By Theorem 5.3, we need only count the number of permutations of the form  $(a_1a_2a_3)$  and  $(a_1a_2a_3)(a_4a_5a_6)$ . As in Example 6, there are  $(7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5)/3 = 70$  elements of the form  $(a_1a_2a_3)$ . For elements of  $S_7$  of the form  $(a_1a_2a_3)(a_4a_5a_6)$  there are  $(7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5)/3$  ways to create the first cycle and  $(4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2)/3$  to create the second cycle but the product of  $(7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5)/3$  and  $(4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2)/3$  counts  $(a_1a_2a_3)(a_4a_5a_6)$  and  $(a_4a_5a_6)(a_3a_2a_1)$  as distinct when they are equal group elements. Thus, the number of elements in  $S_7$  of the form  $(a_1a_2a_3)(a_4a_5a_6)$  is  $(7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5)(4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2)/(3 \cdot 3 \cdot 2) = 280$ . This gives us 350 elements of order 3 in  $S_7$ .

To count the number of elements in  $S_7$  of the form  $(a_1a_2)(a_3a_4)(a_5a_6)$  say, we proceed as before to obtain  $(7 \cdot 6)(5 \cdot 4)(3 \cdot 2) / (2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 3!) = 105$ . The 3! term in the denominator appears because there are 3! ways the product of three 2-cycles can be written and each represents the same group element.

As we will soon see, it is often greatly advantageous to write a permutation as a product of cycles of length 2—that is, as permutations of the form  $(ab)$  where  $a \neq b$ . Many authors call these permutations transpositions, since the effect of  $(ab)$  is to interchange or transpose  $a$  and  $b$ .

Example 8 and Theorem 5.4 show how this can always be done.

# EXAMPLE 8

$$
(1 2 3 4 5) = (1 5) (1 4) (1 3) (1 2)
$$

$$
(1 6 3 2) (4 5 7) = (1 2) (1 3) (1 6) (4 7) (4 5)
$$

# Theorem 5.4 Product of 2-Cycles

Every permutation in  $S_{n}, n > 1$ , is a product of 2-cycles.

PROOF First, note that the identity can be expressed as (12)(12), and so it is a product of 2-cycles. By Theorem 5.1, we know that every permutation can be written in the form

$$
\left(a _ {1} a _ {2} \dots a _ {k}\right) \left(b _ {1} b _ {2} \dots b _ {t}\right) \dots \left(c _ {1} c _ {2} \dots c _ {s}\right).
$$

A direct computation shows that this is the same as

$$
(a _ {1} a _ {k}) (a _ {1} a _ {k - 1}) \dots (a _ {1} a _ {2}) (b _ {1} b _ {t}) (b _ {1} b _ {t - 1}) \dots (b _ {1} b _ {2})
$$

$$
\cdot \cdot \cdot (c _ {1} c _ {s}) (c _ {1} c _ {s - 1}) \cdot \cdot \cdot (c _ {1} c _ {2}).
$$

This completes the proof.

The decomposition of a permutation into a product of 2-cycles given in Example 8 and in the proof of Theorem 5.4 is not the only way a permutation can be written as a product of 2-cycles. Although the next example shows that even the number of 2-cycles may vary from one decomposition to another, we will prove in Theorem 5.5 (first proved by Cauchy) that there is one aspect of a decomposition that never varies.

# EXAMPLE 9

$$
(1 2 3 4 5) = (5 4) (5 3) (5 2) (5 1)
$$

$$
(1 2 3 4 5) = (5 4) (5 2) (2 1) (2 5) (2 3) (1 3)
$$

We isolate a special case of Theorem 5.5 as a lemma.

# Lemma

$$
I f \varepsilon = \beta_ {1} \beta_ {2} \dots \beta_ {r}, w h e r e \beta \text {s a r e 2 - c y c l e s , t h e n} r \text {i s e v e n}.
$$

PROOF Suppose that there is a product  $\beta_{1}\beta_{2}\dots \beta_{r}$  of an odd number of 2-cycles that is the identity. Clearly,  $r\neq 1$  since a 2-cycle is not the identity. Say  $\beta_{1} = (ab)$ . Now observe that there must a 2-cycle  $\beta_{i}$  with  $i > 1$  that contains  $a$ , for otherwise our product would take  $a$  to  $b$ . We may assume that our product  $\beta_{1}\beta_{2}\dots \beta_{r}$  is one for which such an  $i$  is minimum. We may further assume that among all such products our is one with the fewest number of  $a$ 's as an entry in any cycle. If  $i = 2$ , then  $\beta_{1}\beta_{2}$  has the form  $(ab)(ab)$  or  $(ab)(ac)$  where  $c\neq b$  (we can lead with  $a$  in the second cycle because  $(ca) = (ac)$ ). If  $\beta_{1}\beta_{2} = (ab)(ab) = \varepsilon$  then by deleting it we are left with a product with an odd number of 2-cycles that has fewer appearances of  $a$ 's, which contradicts our choice of the product. If  $\beta_{1}\beta_{2} = (ab)(ac)$  where  $c\neq b$  we observe that because  $(ab)(ac) = (ac)(bc)$  we can replace  $\beta_{1}\beta_{2} = (ab)(ac)$  with  $\beta_1^\prime \beta_2^\prime = (ac)(bc)$  to obtain a product of  $r$  2-cycles equal to the identity with an  $a$  in the first cycle and one fewer  $a$  entry in the product  $\beta_1^\prime \beta_2^\prime \dots \beta_r$  than is in  $\beta_{1}\beta_{2}\dots \beta_{r}$ . Since this gives us a contradiction, we may assume that  $i > 2$ . Next note that  $\beta_{i - 1}$  does not contain  $a$  but does contain  $c$  for otherwise  $\beta_{i - 1}$  and  $\beta_{i}$  are disjoint and therefore  $\beta_1^\prime \beta_2^\prime \dots \beta_{i - 2}\beta_{i - 2}\beta_{i + 1}\dots \beta_r$  is a product of  $r$  2-cycles that is the identity, has an  $a$  in the first cycle, and the second appearance of an  $a$  entry occurs before the  $i$ th cycle in the product. This contradicts our choice of  $i$ . So, we know that  $\beta_{i - 1}\beta_{i}$  has the form  $(dc)(ac)$  where  $d\neq a$ . Then, because  $(dc)(ac) = (ad)(dc)$ , we can replace  $\beta_{i - 1}\beta_i = (dc)(ac)$  in the product  $\beta_1'\beta_2'\dots \beta_r$  with  $\beta_{i - 1}'\beta_i' = (ad)(dc)$  to obtain  $\beta_1'\beta_2'\dots \beta_{i - 1}'\beta_i'\dots \beta_r$ , which as before, is a product of  $r$  2-cycles that is the identity and has an  $a$  in the first cycle and the second appearance of an  $a$  entry occurs before that  $i$ th cycle in the product. This contradiction finishes the proof.

# Theorem 5.5 Always Even or Always Odd

If a permutation  $\alpha$  can be expressed as a product of an even (odd) number of 2-cycles, then every decomposition of  $\alpha$  into a product of 2-cycles must have an even (odd) number of 2-cycles. In symbols, if

$$
\alpha = \beta_ {1} \beta_ {2} \dots \beta_ {r} \quad \text {a n d} \quad \alpha = \gamma_ {1} \gamma_ {2} \dots \gamma_ {s},
$$

where the  $\beta$ 's and the  $\gamma$ 's are 2-cycles, then  $r$  and  $s$  are both even or both odd.

PROOF Observe that  $\beta_{1}\beta_{2}\dots \beta_{r} = \gamma_{1}\gamma_{2}\dots \gamma_{s}$  implies

$$
\begin{array}{l} \varepsilon = \gamma_ {1} \gamma_ {2} \dots \gamma_ {s} \beta_ {r} ^ {- 1} \dots \beta_ {2} ^ {- 1} \beta_ {1} ^ {- 1} \\ = \gamma_ {1} \gamma_ {2} \dots \gamma_ {s} \beta_ {r} \dots \beta_ {2} \beta_ {1}, \\ \end{array}
$$

since a 2-cycle is its own inverse. Thus, the lemma preceding Theorem 5.5 guarantees that  $s + r$  is even. It follows that  $r$  and  $s$  are both even or both odd.

# Definitions Even and Odd Permutations

A permutation that can be expressed as a product of an even number of 2-cycles is called an even permutation. A permutation that can be expressed as a product of an odd number of 2-cycles is called an odd permutation.

Theorems 5.4 and 5.5 together show that every permutation can be unambiguously classified as either even or odd. The significance of this observation is given in Theorem 5.6.

# Theorem 5.6 Even Permutations Form a Group

The set of even permutations in  $S_{n}$  forms a subgroup of  $S_{n}$ .

PROOF This proof is left to the reader.

The subgroup of even permutations in  $S_{n}$  arises so often that we give it a special name and notation.

# Definition Alternating Group of Degree  $n$

The group of even permutations of  $n$  symbols is denoted by  $A_{n}$  and is called the alternating group of degree  $n$ .

The next result shows that exactly half of the elements of  $S_{n}$  ( $n > 1$ ) are even permutations.

# Theorem 5.7  $|A_{n}|$

For  $n > 1$ ,  $A_{n}$  has order  $n! / 2$ .

PROOF For each odd permutation  $\alpha$ , the permutation  $(12)\alpha$  is even and, by the cancellation property in groups,  $(12)\alpha \neq (12)\beta$  when  $\alpha \neq \beta$ . Thus, there are at least as many even permutations as there are odd ones. On the other hand, for each even permutation  $\alpha$ , the permutation  $(12)\alpha$  is odd and  $(12)\alpha \neq (12)\beta$  when  $\alpha \neq \beta$ . Thus, there are at least as many odd permutations as there are even ones. It follows that there are equal numbers of even and odd permutations. Since  $|S_{n}| = n!$ , we have  $|A_{n}| = n! / 2$ .

The names for the symmetric group and the alternating group of degree  $n$  come from the study of polynomials over  $n$  variables. A symmetric polynomial in the variables  $x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n}$  is one that is unchanged under any transposition of two of the variables. An alternating polynomial is one that changes signs under any transposition of two of the variables. For example, the polynomial  $x_{1}x_{2}x_{3}$  is unchanged by any transposition of two of the three

variables, whereas the polynomial  $(x_{1} - x_{2})(x_{1} - x_{3})(x_{2} - x_{3})$  changes signs when any two of the variables are transposed. Since every member of the symmetric group is the product of transpositions, the symmetric polynomials are those that are unchanged by members of the symmetric group. Likewise, since any member of the alternating group is the product of an even number of transpositions, the alternating polynomials are those that are unchanged by members of the alternating group.

The alternating groups are among the most important examples of groups. The groups  $A_4$  and  $A_5$  will arise on several occasions in later chapters. In particular,  $A_5$  has great historical significance.

A geometric interpretation of  $A_4$  is given in Example 10, and a multiplication table for  $A_4$  is given as Table 5.1.

# EXAMPLE 10 Rotations of a Tetrahedron

The 12 rotations of a regular tetrahedron can be conveniently described with the elements of  $A_4$ . The top row of Figure 5.1 illustrates the identity and three  $180^\circ$  "edge" rotations about axes joining midpoints of two edges. The second row consists of  $120^\circ$  "face" rotations about axes joining a vertex to the center of the opposite face. The third row consists of  $-120^\circ$  (or  $240^\circ$ ) "face" rotations. Notice that the four rotations in the second row can be obtained from those in the first row by left-multiplying the four in the first row by the rotation (123), whereas those in the third row can be obtained from those in the first row by left-multiplying the ones in the first row by (132).

Many molecules with chemical formulas of the form  $AB_{4}$ , such as methane (CH₄) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄), have  $A_{4}$  as their symmetry group. Figure 5.2 shows the form of one such molecule.

Many games and puzzles can be analyzed using permutations.

coding information to prevent unauthorized use is called encryption. Historically, encryption was used primarily for military and diplomatic transmissions. Today, encryption is essential for securing electronic transactions of all kinds. Cryptography is what allows you to have a Website safely receive your credit card number. Cryptographic schemes prevent hackers from charging calls to your cell phone account.

Among the first known cryptosystems is the Caesar cipher, used by Julius Caesar to send messages to his troops. Caesar encrypted a message by replacing each letter with the letter three positions further in the alphabet with x, y and z wrapping around to a, b and c. Identifying the 26 letters of the alphabet with  $0,1,\ldots,25$  in order, the Caesar method replaces letter  $i$  with letter  $(i + 3)$  mod 26. For example, the message ATTACK AT DAWN is encrypted as DWWDFN DW GDZQ. To decrypt the message one replaces letter  $i$  with letter  $(i - 3)$  mod 26.

Any permutation can be used as a cipher. To use the permutation  $\alpha = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ 3 & 4 & 2 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$  to encrypt the message ATTACK AT DAWN we first break the message up into blocks of four letters each ignoring the spaces between

the words to obtain the plaintext ATTA CKAT DAWN. (This has the added advantage of disguising the lengths of each word, which makes breaking the code more difficult.) We then reorder the four letters in each block in the same way  $\alpha$  reordered the integers 1, 2, 3, and 4. That is, the first letter is put in the third position, the second letter is put in the fourth position, the third letter is put in the second position, and the fourth letter is put in the first position. Doing this for each block we have ATAT TACK NWDA. Of course one decrypts a message encrypted by using  $\alpha$  by using  $\alpha^{-1}$ .

To enhance security one would use a permutation of long length  $n$  and blocks of length other than  $n$  so that anyone not authorized to receive the encrypted message would not know the permutation length. In cases where the number of message characters is not divisible by the block length the sender simply fills out the last block with nonsense letters. For example, for the message RETREAT AT DUSK with block length 4 we could use RETR EATA TDUS KIUE. The recipient of the message will recognize the nonsense letters as padding needed to complete the last block.

Enigma machines were cipher devices used by the Germans in World War II (1939-1945). An Enigma machine had three to five wheels that would scramble the letters of a message. The machines were easy to use and offered a high degree of security when used properly. Although messages encoded with Enigma machines were difficult to break, operator negligence and the capture of a number of Enigma machines and the tables of wheel settings by the Allied forces allowed Polish and British cryptologists to break the code.

# Rubik's Cube

The Rubik's Cube made from 48 cubes called "facets" is the quintessential example of a group theory puzzle. It was invented in 1974 by the Hungarian Errő Rubik. By 2009 more than 350 million Rubik's Cubes had been sold. In 2020 the record time for solving it is under 4 seconds; under 17 seconds blindfolded. Although it was proved in 1995 that there was a starting configuration that required at least 20 moves to solve, it was not until 2010

that it was determined that every cube could be solved in at most 20 moves. This computer calculation utilized about 35 CPU-years donated by Google to complete. In early discussions about the minimum number of moves to solve the cube in the worst possible case, someone called it "God's number," and the name stuck. A history of the quest to find God's number is given at the website at http://www.cube20.org/.

The set of all configurations of the Rubik's Cube form a group of permutations of order 43,252,003,274,489,856,000. This order can be computed using GAP by labeling the faces of the cube as shown here.

# A Check-Digit Scheme Based on  $D_{5}$

In Chapter 0, we presented several schemes for appending a check digit to an identification number. Among these schemes, only the International Standard Book Number method was capable of detecting all single-digit errors and all transposition errors involving adjacent digits. However, recall that this success was achieved by introducing the alphabetical character X to handle the case where 10 was required to make the dot product 0 modulo 11.

In contrast, in 1969, J. Verhoeff devised a method utilizing the dihedral group of order 10 that detects all single-digit errors and all transposition errors involving adjacent digits without the necessity of avoiding certain numbers or introducing a new character. To describe this method, consider the permutation  $\sigma = (01589427)(36)$  and the dihedral group of order 10 as represented in Table 5.2. (Here we use 0 through 4 for the rotations, 5 through 9 for the reflections, and * for the operation of  $D_{5}$ .)

Verhoeff's idea was to view the digits 0 through 9 as the elements of the group  $D_{5}$  and to replace ordinary addition with calculations done in  $D_{5}$ . In particular, to any string of digits  $a_{1}a_{2}\ldots a_{n - 1}$ , we append the check digit  $a_{n}$

so that  $\sigma(a_1) * \sigma^2(a_2) * \dots * \sigma^{n-2}(a_{n-2}) * \sigma^{n-1}(a_{n-1}) * \sigma^n(a_n) = 0$ . [Here  $\sigma^2(x) = \sigma(\sigma(x)), \sigma^3(x) = \sigma(\sigma^2(x))$ , and so on.] Since  $\sigma$  has the property that  $\sigma^i(a) \neq \sigma^i(b)$  if  $a \neq b$ , all single-digit errors are detected. Also, because

$$
a * \sigma (b) \neq b * \sigma (a) \quad \text {i f} a \neq b, \tag {5.1}
$$

as can be checked on a case-by-case basis (see Exercise 71), it follows that all transposition errors involving adjacent digits are detected [since Equation (1) implies that  $\sigma^i(a) * \sigma^{i+1}(b) \neq \sigma^i(b) * \sigma^{i+1}(a)$  if  $a \neq b$ ].

From 1990 until 2002, the German government used a minor modification of Verhoeff's check-digit scheme to append a check digit to the serial numbers on German banknotes. Table 5.3 gives the values of the functions  $\sigma, \sigma^2, \ldots, \sigma^{10}$  needed for the computations. [The functional value  $\sigma^i(j)$  appears in the row labeled with  $\sigma^i$  and the column labeled  $j$ .] Since the serial numbers on the banknotes use 10 letters of the alphabet in addition to the 10 decimal digits, it is necessary to assign numerical values to the letters to compute the check digit. This assignment is shown in Table 5.4.

To any string of digits  $a_1a_2 \ldots a_{10}$  corresponding to a banknote serial number, the check digit  $a_{11}$  is chosen such that  $\sigma(a_1)*\sigma^2(a_2)*\dots*\sigma^9(a_9)*\sigma^{10}(a_{10})*a_{11} = 0$  [instead of  $\sigma(a_1)*\sigma^2(a_2)*\dots*\sigma^{10}(a_{10})*\sigma^{11}(a_{11}) = 0$  as in the Verhoeff scheme].

To trace through a specific example, consider the banknote (featuring the mathematician Gauss) shown in Figure 5.3 with the number AG8536827U7. To verify that 7 is the appropriate check digit, we observe that  $\sigma(0)*\sigma^2(2)*\sigma^3(8)*\sigma^4(5)*\sigma^5(3)*\sigma^6(6)*\sigma^7(8)*\sigma^8(2)*\sigma^9(7)*\sigma^{10}(7)*7 = 1*0*2*2*6*6*5*2*0*1*7 = 0$ , as it should be. [To illustrate how to use the multiplication table for  $D_5$ , we compute  $1*0*2*2 = (1*0)*2*2 = 1*2*2 = (1*2)*2 = 3*2 = 0$ .]

Figure 5.3 German banknote with serial number AG8536827U and check digit 7.

One shortcoming of the German banknote scheme is that it does not distinguish between a letter and its assigned numerical value. Thus, a substitution of 7 for U (or vice versa) and the transposition of 7 and U are not detected by the check digit. Moreover, the banknote scheme does not detect all transpositions of adjacent characters involving the check digit itself. For example, the transposition of D and 8 in positions 10 and 11 is not detected. Both of these defects can be avoided by using the Verhoeff method with  $D_{18}$ , the dihedral group of order 36, to assign every letter and digit a distinct value together with an appropriate function  $\sigma$ . Using this method to append a check character, all single position errors and all transposition errors involving adjacent digits will be detected.

# Augustin Cauchy

You see that little young man? Well! He will supplant all of us in so far as we are mathematicians.

Spoken by Lagrange to Laplace about the 11-year-old Cauchy

AUGUSTIN LOUIS CAUCHY was born on August 21, 1789, in Paris. By the time he was 11, both Laplace and Lagrange had recognized Cauchy's extraordinary talent for mathematics. In school he won prizes for Greek, Latin, and the humanities. At the age of 21, he was given a commission in Napoleon's army as a civil engineer. For the next few years, Cauchy attended to his engineering duties while carrying out brilliant mathematical research on the side.

In 1815, at the age of 26, Cauchy was made Professor of Mathematics at the École Polytechnique and was recognized as the leading mathematician in France. Cauchy and his contemporary Gauss were among the last mathematicians to know

the whole of mathematics as known at their time, and both made important contributions to nearly every branch, both pure and applied, as well as to physics and astronomy. Cauchy introduced a new level of rigor into mathematical analysis. We owe our contemporary notions of limit and continuity to him. He gave the first proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Cauchy was the founder of complex function theory and a pioneer in the theory of permutation groups and determinants. His total written output of mathematics fills 24 large volumes. He wrote more than 500 research papers after the age of 50. Cauchy died at the age of 67 on May 23, 1857.

# Alan Turing

Every time you use a phone, or a computer, you use the ideas that Alan Turing invented. Alan discovered intelligence in computers, and today he surrounds us. A true hero of mankind.

ERIC E. SCHMIDT, Executive Chairman, Google

On Time magazine's list of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century was Alan Turing, a mathematician born in London on June 23, 1912. While a college student Turing developed ideas that would lay the foundation for theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. After graduating from college Turing became a crucial member of a team of cryptologists working for the British government who successfully broke the Enigma codes.

Turing's life took a tragic turn in 1952 when he admitted that he had engaged in homosexual acts in his home, which was a felony in Britain at that time. As punishment, he was chemically castrated and subjected to estrogen treatments. Despondent because of this treatment, he committed suicide by eating an apple laced with cyanide at the age of 41. Today Turing is

widely honored for his fundamental contributions to computer science and his role in the defeat of Germany in World War II. Many rooms, lecture halls, and buildings at universities around the world have been named in honor of Turing. The annual award for contributions to the computing community, which is widely considered to be the equivalent to a Nobel Prize, is called the "Turing Award."

In 2013, Queen Elizabeth II granted Turing a pardon and issued a statement saying Turing's treatment was unjust and "Turing was an exceptional man with a brilliant mind who deserves to be remembered and recognized for his fantastic contribution to the war effort and his legacy to science."

# 6 Isomorphisms

Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things.

Henri Poincaré (1854-1912)

The basis for poetry and scientific discovery is the ability to comprehend the unlike in the like and the like in the unlike.

Jacob Bronowski

# Motivation

Suppose an American and a German are asked to count a handful of objects. The American says, "One, two, three, four, five, . . .," whereas the German says, "Eins, zwei, drei, vier, fünf, . . .." Are the two doing different things? No. They are both counting the objects, but they are using different terminology to do so. Similarly, when one person says, "Two plus three is five" and another says, "Zwei und drei ist fünf," the two are in agreement on the concept they are describing, but they are using different terminology to describe the concept. An analogous situation often occurs with groups; the same group is described with different terminology. We have seen two examples of this so far. In Chapter 1, we described the symmetries of a square in geometric terms (e.g.,  $R_{90}$ ), whereas in Chapter 5 we described the same group by way of permutations of the corners. In both cases, the underlying group was the symmetries of a square. In Chapter 4, we observed that when we have a cyclic group of order  $n$  generated by  $a$ , the operation turns out to be essentially that of addition modulo  $n$ , since  $a^r a^s = a^k$ , where  $k = (r + s) \mod n$ . For example, each of  $U(43)$  and  $U(49)$  is cyclic of order 42. So, each has the form  $\langle a \rangle$ , where  $a^r a^s = a^{(r + s)^{\mathrm{mod} 42}}$ .

# Definition and Examples

In this chapter, we give a formal method for determining whether two groups defined in different terms are really the same. When this is the case, we say that there is an isomorphism between the two groups. This notion was first introduced by Galois about 190 years ago. The term isomorphism is derived from the Greek words  $\text{isos}$ , meaning "same" or "equal," and morphhe, meaning "form." R. Allenby has colorfully defined an algebraist as "a person who can't tell the difference between isomorphic systems."

# Definitions Group Isomorphism

An isomorphism  $\phi$  from a group  $G$  to a group  $\overline{G}$  is a one-to-one onto mapping (or function) from  $G$  to  $\overline{G}$  that preserves the group operation. That is,

$$
\phi (a b) = \phi (a) \phi (b) \quad \text {f o r a l l} a, b \text {i n} G.
$$

If there is an isomorphism from  $G$  onto  $\overline{G}$ , we say that  $G$  and  $\overline{G}$  are isomorphic and write  $G \approx \overline{G}$ .

The definition of isomorphism ensures that if  $\phi$  is an isomorphism from  $G$  to  $\overline{G}$  then the operation table for  $\overline{G}$  can be obtained from the operation table for  $G$  by replacing each entry in the table for  $G$  by  $\phi(x)$ . See Figure 6.1. Thus the groups differ in notation only.

![](images/57b6617de73f1f350aa5b55828e0c858450dce6c15bedd36d004c2172f37d9e5.jpg)  
Figure 6.1 Operations table for  $G$  and  $\overline{G}$ .

It is implicit in the definition of isomorphism that isomorphic groups have the same order. It is also implicit in the definition of isomorphism that the operation on the left side of the equal sign is that of  $G$ , whereas the operation on the right side is that of  $\overline{G}$ . The four cases involving  $\cdot$  and  $+$  are shown in Table 6.1.

There are four separate steps involved in proving that a group  $G$  is isomorphic to a group  $\overline{G}$ .

Step 1 "Mapping." Define a candidate for the isomorphism; that is, define a function  $\phi$  from  $G$  to  $\overline{G}$ .

Step 2 "1-1." Prove that  $\phi$  is one-to-one; that is, assume that  $\phi(a) = \phi(b)$  and prove that  $a = b$ .

Step 3 "Onto." Prove that  $\phi$  is onto; that is, for any element  $\overline{g}$  in  $\overline{G}$ , find an element  $g$  in  $G$  such that  $\phi(g) = \overline{g}$ .

Step 4 "O.P." Prove that  $\phi$  is operation-preserving; that is, show that  $\phi(ab) = \phi(a)\phi(b)$  for all  $a$  and  $b$  in  $G$ .

None of these steps is unfamiliar to you. The only one that may appear novel is the fourth one. It requires that one be able to obtain the same result by combining two elements and then mapping, or by mapping two elements and then combining them. Roughly speaking, this says that the two processes—operating and mapping—can be done in either order without affecting the result. This same concept arises in calculus when we say

$$
\lim  _ {x \to a} (f (x) \cdot g (x)) = \lim  _ {x \to a} f (x) \lim  _ {x \to a} g (x)
$$

or

$$
\int_ {a} ^ {b} (f + g) d x = \int_ {a} ^ {b} f d x + \int_ {a} ^ {b} g d x.
$$

In linear algebra an invertible linear transformation from a vector space  $V$  onto a vector space  $W$  is a group isomorphism from  $V$  to  $W$ . (Every vector space is an Abelian group under vector addition.)

Before going any further, let's consider some examples.

EXAMPLE 1 Let  $G$  be the real numbers under addition and let  $\overline{G}$  be the positive real numbers under multiplication. Then  $G$  and  $\overline{G}$  are isomorphic under the mapping  $\phi(x) = 2^x$ . Certainly,  $\phi$  is a function from  $G$  to  $\overline{G}$ . To prove that it is one-to-one, suppose that  $2^x = 2^y$ . Then  $\log_2 2^x = \log_2 2^y$ , and therefore  $x = y$ . For "onto," we must find for any positive real number  $y$  some real number  $x$  such that  $\phi(x) = y$ ; that is,  $2^x = y$ . Well, solving for  $x$  gives  $\log_2 y$ . Finally,

$$
\phi (x + y) = 2 ^ {x + y} = 2 ^ {x} \cdot 2 ^ {y} = \phi (x) \phi (y)
$$

for all  $x$  and  $y$  in  $G$ , so that  $\phi$  is operation-preserving as well.

EXAMPLE 2 Any infinite cyclic group is isomorphic to  $Z$ . Indeed, if  $a$  is a generator of the cyclic group, the mapping  $a^k \to k$  is an isomorphism. Any finite cyclic group  $\langle a \rangle$  of order  $n$  is isomorphic to  $Z_n$  under the mapping  $a^k \to k \mod n$ . That these correspondences are functions and are one-to-one is the essence of Theorem 4.1. Obviously, the mappings are onto. That the mappings are operation-preserving follows from Exercise 11 in Chapter 0 in the finite case and from the definitions in the infinite case.

EXAMPLE 3 The mapping from  $\mathbf{R}$  under addition to itself given by  $\phi(x) = x^3$  is not an isomorphism. Although  $\phi$  is one-to-one and onto, it is not operation-preserving, since it is not true that  $(x + y)^3 = x^3 + y^3$  for all  $x$  and  $y$ .

EXAMPLE 4  $U(10) \approx Z_4$  and  $U(5) \approx Z_4$ . To verify this, one need only observe that both  $U(10)$  and  $U(5)$  are cyclic of order 4. Then appeal to Example 2.

EXAMPLE 5 There is no isomorphism from  $Q$ , the group of rational numbers under addition, to  $Q^*$ , the group of nonzero rational numbers under multiplication. If  $\phi$  were such a mapping, there would be a rational number  $a$  such that  $\phi(a) = -1$ . But then

$$
- 1 = \phi (a) = \phi \left(\frac {1}{2} a + \frac {1}{2} a\right) = \phi \left(\frac {1}{2} a\right) \phi \left(\frac {1}{2} a\right) = \left(\phi \left(\frac {1}{2} a\right)\right) ^ {2}.
$$

However, no rational number squared is  $-1$ .

EXAMPLE 6 Let  $G = SL(2, \mathbf{R})$ , the group of  $2 \times 2$  real matrices with determinant 1. Let  $M$  be any  $2 \times 2$  real matrix with determinant 1. Then we can define a mapping from  $G$  to  $G$  itself by  $\phi_M(A) = MAM^{-1}$  for all  $A$  in  $G$ . To verify that  $\phi_M$  is an isomorphism, we carry out the four steps.

Step 1  $\phi_M$  is a function from  $G$  to  $G$ . Here, we must show that  $\phi_M(A)$  is indeed an element of  $G$  whenever  $A$  is. This follows from properties of determinants:

$$
\det (M A M ^ {- 1}) = (\det M) (\det A) (\det M) ^ {- 1} = 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 ^ {- 1} = 1.
$$

Thus,  $MAM^{-1}$  is in  $G$ .

Step 2  $\phi_M$  is one-to-one. Suppose that  $\phi_M(A) = \phi_M(B)$ . Then  $MAM^{-1} = MBA^{-1}$  and, by left and right cancellation,  $A = B$ .

Step 3  $\phi_M$  is onto. Let  $B$  belong to  $G$ . We must find a matrix  $A$  in  $G$  such that  $\phi_M(A) = B$ . How shall we do this? If such a matrix  $A$  is to exist, it must have the property that  $MAM^{-1} = B$ . But this tells us exactly what  $A$  must be! For we can solve for  $A$  to obtain  $A = M^{-1}BM$  and verify that  $\phi_M(A) = MAM^{-1} = M(M^{-1}BM)M^{-1} = B$ .

Step 4  $\phi_M$  is operation-preserving. Let  $A$  and  $B$  belong to  $G$ . Then,

$$
\begin{array}{l} \phi_ {M} (A B) = M (A B) M ^ {- 1} = M A (M ^ {- 1} M) B M ^ {- 1} \\ = (M A M ^ {- 1}) (M B M ^ {- 1}) = \phi_ {M} (A) \phi_ {M} (B). \\ \end{array}
$$

The mapping  $\phi_M$  is called conjugation by  $M$ .

# Properties of Isomorphisms

Our first two theorems give a catalog of properties of isomorphisms and isomorphic groups.

# Theorem 6.1 Properties of Isomorphisms Acting on Elements

Suppose that  $\phi$  is an isomorphism from a group  $G$  onto a group  $\overline{G}$ . Then

1.  $\phi$  carries the identity of  $G$  to the identity of  $\overline{G}$ .  
2. For every integer  $n$  and for every group element  $a$  in  $G$ ,  $\phi(a^n) = (\phi(a))^n$ . (Additive form:  $\phi(na) = n\phi(a)$ .)  
3. For any elements  $a$  and  $b$  in  $G$ ,  $a$  and  $b$  commute if and only if  $\phi(a)$  and  $\phi(b)$  commute.  
4.  $G = \langle a\rangle$  if and only if  $\overline{G} = \langle \phi (a)\rangle$  
5.  $|a| = |\phi(a)|$  for all  $a$  in  $G$  (isomorphisms preserve orders).  
6. For a fixed integer  $k$  and a fixed group element  $b$  in  $G$ , the equation  $x^k = b$  has the same number of solutions in  $G$  as does the equation  $x^k = \phi(b)$  in  $\overline{G}$ .  
7. If  $G$  is finite, then  $G$  and  $\overline{G}$  have exactly the same number of elements of every order.

PROOF We will restrict ourselves to proving only properties 1, 2, and 4, but observe that property 5 follows from properties 1 and 2, property 6 follows from property 2, and property 7 follows from property 5. For convenience, let us denote the identity in  $G$  by  $e$  and the identity in  $\overline{G}$  by  $\overline{e}$ . Then, since  $\phi(e) \in \overline{G}$  and  $e = ee$ , we have  $\overline{e}\phi(e) = \phi(e) = \phi(ee) = \phi(e)\phi(e)$ . Thus, by right cancellation,  $\overline{e} = \phi(e)$ . This proves property 1.

For positive integers, property 2 follows from the definition of an isomorphism and mathematical induction. If  $n$  is negative, then  $-n$  is positive, and we have from property 1 and the observation about the positive integer case that  $e = \phi(e) = \phi(g^n g^{-n}) = \phi(g^n)\phi(g^{-n}) = \phi(g^n)(\phi(g))^{-n}$ . Thus, multiplying both sides on the right by  $(\phi(g))^n$ , we have  $(\phi(g))^n = \phi(g^n)$ . Property 1 takes care of the case  $n = 0$ .

To prove property 4, let  $G = \langle a \rangle$  and note that, by closure,  $\langle \phi(a) \rangle \subseteq \overline{G}$ . Because  $\phi$  is onto, for any element  $b$  in  $\overline{G}$ , there is an element  $a^k$  in  $G$  such that  $\phi(a^k) = b$ . Thus,  $b = (\phi(a))^k$  and so  $b \in \langle \phi(a) \rangle$ . This proves that  $\overline{G} = \langle \phi(a) \rangle$ .

Now suppose that  $\overline{G} = \langle \phi(a) \rangle$ . Clearly,  $\langle a \rangle \subseteq G$ . For any element  $b$  in  $G$ , we have  $\phi(b) \in \langle \phi(a) \rangle$ . So, for some integer  $k$  we have  $\phi(b) = (\phi(a))^k = \phi(a^k)$ . Because  $\phi$  is one-to-one,  $b = a^k$ . This proves that  $\langle a \rangle = G$ .

Property 4 says that an isomorphism between two cyclic groups takes a generator to a generator.

# Theorem 6.2 Properties of Isomorphisms Acting on Groups

Suppose that  $\phi$  is an isomorphism from a group  $G$  onto a group  $\overline{G}$ . Then

1.  $\phi^{-1}$  is an isomorphism from  $\overline{G}$  onto  $G$ .  
2.  $G$  is Abelian if and only if  $\overline{G}$  is Abelian.  
3.  $G$  is cyclic if and only if  $\overline{G}$  is cyclic.

4. If  $K$  is a subgroup of  $G$ , then  $\phi(K) = \{\phi(k) \mid k \in K\}$  is a subgroup of  $\overline{G}$ .  
5. If  $\overline{K}$  is a subgroup of  $\overline{G}$ , then  $\phi^{-1}(\overline{K}) = \{g \in G \mid \phi(g) \in \overline{K}\}$  is a subgroup of  $G$ .  
6.  $\phi (\overline{Z} (G)) = Z(\overline{G})$

PROOF Properties 1 and 4 are left as an exercise (Exercise 1). Properties 2 and 6 are a direct consequence of property 3 of Theorem 6.1. Property 3 follows from property 4 of Theorem 6.1 and property 1 of Theorem 6.2. Property 5 follows from properties 1 and 4.

Theorems 6.1 and 6.2 provide several convenient ways to prove that groups  $G$  and  $\overline{G}$  are not isomorphic.

1. Observe that  $|G| \neq |\overline{G}|$ .  
2. Observe that  $G$  or  $\overline{G}$  is cyclic and the other is not.  
3. Observe that  $G$  or  $\overline{G}$  is Abelian and the other is not.  
4. Show that largest order of any element in  $G$  is not the same as the largest order of any element in  $\overline{G}$ .  
5. Show that the number of elements of some specific order in  $G$  (the smallest order greater than 1 is often the good choice) is not the same as the number of elements of that order in  $\overline{G}$ .

EXAMPLE 7 Consider these three groups of order 12:  $Z_{12}$ ,  $D_6$ , and  $A_4$ . A quick check shows that the largest order of any element in the three are 12, 6, and 3, respectively. So no two are isomorphic. Alternatively, the number of elements of order 2 in each is 1, 7, and 3.

EXAMPLE 8 The group  $Q$  of rational numbers under addition is not isomorphic to the group  $Q^*$  of nonzero rational numbers under multiplication because every non-identity element of  $Q$  has infinite order (because  $nx = 0$  if and only if  $n = 0$ ) or  $x = 0$  whereas in  $Q^*, |-1| = 2$ .

Theorems 6.1 and 6.2 show that isomorphic groups have many properties in common. Actually, the definition is precisely formulated so that isomorphic groups have all group theoretic properties in common.

By this we mean that if two groups are isomorphic, then any property that can be expressed in the language of group theory is true for one if and only if it is true for the other. This is why algebraists speak of isomorphic groups as "equal" or "the same." Admittedly, calling such groups equivalent, rather than the same, might be more appropriate, but we bow to long-standing tradition.

Besides providing a method for determining if two groups have identical group theoretical properties, isomorphisms allow us to deduce properties about a group  $G$  that is not convenient to work with by using a group  $\overline{G}$  isomorphic to  $G$  that is easier to work with. Exercise 43 provides an example of a question about a particular group that seems difficult to answer that becomes easy when viewed as a question about an isomorphic version of the

group. Many more examples will be given in Chapters 8 and 11. If  $G$  and  $\overline{G}$  are isomorphic groups you can think of  $G$  as a camouflaged version of  $\overline{G}$ .

# Automorphisms

Certain kinds of isomorphisms are referred to so often that they have been given special names.

# Definition Automorphism

An isomorphism from a group  $G$  onto itself is called an automorphism automorphism of  $G$ .

The isomorphism in Example 6 is an automorphism of  $SL(2,\mathbf{R})$ . Two more examples follow.

EXAMPLE 9 The function  $\phi$  from  $\mathbf{C}$  to  $\mathbf{C}$  given by  $\phi(a + bi) = a - bi$  is an automorphism of the group of complex numbers under addition. The restriction of  $\phi$  to  $\mathbf{C}^*$  is also an automorphism of the group of nonzero complex numbers under multiplication. (See Exercise 39.)

EXAMPLE 10 Let  $\mathbf{R}^2 = \{(a,b) | a, b \in \mathbf{R}\}$ . Then  $\phi(a,b) = (b,a)$  is an automorphism of the group  $\mathbf{R}^2$  under componentwise addition. Geometrically,  $\phi$  reflects each point in the plane across the line  $y = x$ . In fact, any reflection across a line passing through the origin or any rotation of the plane about the origin is an automorphism of  $\mathbf{R}^2$ .

More generally, every invertible linear transformation of a vector space  $V$  to itself is an automorphism of  $V$ .

The isomorphism in Example 6 is a particular instance of an automorphism that arises often enough to warrant a name and notation of its own.

# Definition Inner Automorphism Induced by  $a$

Let  $G$  be a group, and let  $a \in G$ . The function  $\phi_a$  defined by  $\phi_a(x) = axa^{-1}$  for all  $x$  in  $G$  is called the inner automorphism of  $G$  induced by  $a$ .

We leave it for the reader to show that  $\phi_{a}$  is actually an automorphism of  $G$ .

EXAMPLE 11 The action of the inner automorphism of  $D_4$  induced by  $R_{90}$  is given in the following table.

<table><tr><td>x</td><td>φR90</td><td>R90 x R90-1</td></tr><tr><td>R0</td><td>→</td><td>R90R0R90-1 = R0</td></tr><tr><td>R90</td><td>→</td><td>R90R90R90-1 = R90</td></tr><tr><td>R180</td><td>→</td><td>R90R180R90-1 = R180</td></tr><tr><td>R270</td><td>→</td><td>R90R270R90-1 = R270</td></tr><tr><td>H</td><td>→</td><td>R90HR90-1 = V</td></tr><tr><td>V</td><td>→</td><td>R90VR90-1 = H</td></tr><tr><td>D</td><td>→</td><td>R90DR90-1 = D&#x27;</td></tr><tr><td>D&#x27;</td><td>→</td><td>R90D&#x27;R90-1 = D</td></tr></table>

When  $G$  is a group, we use  $\operatorname{Aut}(G)$  to denote the set of all automorphisms of  $G$  and  $\operatorname{Inn}(G)$  to denote the set of all inner automorphisms of  $G$ . The reason these sets are noteworthy is demonstrated by the next theorem.

# Theorem 6.3 Aut  $(G)$  and Inn  $(G)$  are Groups

The set of automorphisms of a group and the set of inner automorphisms of a group are both groups under the operation of function composition.

PROOF The proof of Theorem 6.3 is left as an exercise (Exercise 17).

The determination of  $\operatorname{Inn}(G)$  is routine. If  $G = \{e, a, b, c, \ldots\}$ , then  $\operatorname{Inn}(G) = \{\phi_e, \phi_a, \phi_b, \phi_c, \ldots\}$ . This latter list may have duplications, however, since  $\phi_a$  may be equal to  $\phi_b$  even though  $a \neq b$  (see Exercise 47). Thus, the only work involved in determining  $\operatorname{Inn}(G)$  is deciding which distinct elements give the distinct automorphisms. On the other hand, the determination of  $\operatorname{Aut}(G)$  is, in general, quite involved.

# EXAMPLE 12  $\operatorname{Inn}(D_4)$

To determine  $\mathrm{Inn}(D_4)$ , we first observe that the complete list of inner automorphisms is  $\phi_{R_0},\phi_{R_{90}},\phi_{R_{180}},\phi_{R_{270}},\phi_H,\phi_V,\phi_D$ , and  $\phi_{D'}$ . Our job is to determine the repetitions in this list. Since  $R_{180}\in Z(D_4)$ , we have  $\phi_{R_{180}}(x) = R_{180}xR_{180}^{-1} = x$ , so that  $\phi_{R_{180}} = \phi_{R_0}$ . Also,  $\phi_{R_{270}}(x) = R_{270}xR_{270}^{-1} = R_{90}R_{180}xR_{180}^{-1}R_{90}^{-1} = R_{90}xR_{90}^{-1} = \phi_{R_{90}}(x)$ . Similarly, since  $H = R_{180}V$  and  $D^{\prime} = R_{180}D$ , we have  $\phi_H = \phi_V$  and  $\phi_D = \phi_{D'}$ . This proves that the previous list can be pared down to  $\phi_{R_0},\phi_{R_{90}},\phi_H$ , and  $\phi_D$ . We leave it to the reader to show that these are distinct (Exercise 15).

The next example shows how the inner automorphisms of a group provide a convenient way to create multiple isomorphic subgroups of the group.

EXAMPLE 13 Given the subgroup of  $S_4$

$$
H = \{(1), (1 2 3 4), (1 3) (2 4), (1 4 3 2), (1 2) (3 4), (2 4), (1 4) (2 3), (1 3) \}
$$

we have the subgroups

$$
\begin{array}{l} (1 2) H (2 1) = \{(1), (1 3 4 2), (1 4) (2 3), (1 2 3 4), (1 2) (3 4), (1 4), \\ (1 3) (2 4), (2 3) \} \\ \end{array}
$$

and

$$
\begin{array}{l} (1 2 3) H (3 2 1) = \{(1), (1 4 2 3), (1 2) (3 4), (1 3 2 4), (1 4) (2 3), (3 4), \\ (1 3) (2 4), (1 2) \} \\ \end{array}
$$

of  $S_4$  that are isomorphic to  $H$ .

# EXAMPLE 14  $\operatorname{Aut}(Z_{10})$

To compute  $\operatorname{Aut}(Z_{10})$ , we try to discover enough information about an element  $\alpha$  of  $\operatorname{Aut}(Z_{10})$  to determine how  $\alpha$  must be defined. Because  $Z_{10}$  is so simple, this is not difficult to do. To begin with, observe that once we know  $\alpha(1)$ , we know  $\alpha(k)$  for any  $k$ , because

$$
\begin{array}{l} \alpha (k) = \underbrace {\alpha (1 + 1 + \cdots + 1)} _ {k \text {t e r m s}} \\ = \underbrace {\alpha (1) + \alpha (1) + \cdots + \alpha (1)} _ {k \text {t e r m s}} = k \alpha (1). \\ \end{array}
$$

So, we need only determine the choices for  $\alpha(1)$  that make  $\alpha$  an automorphism of  $Z_{10}$ . Since property 5 of Theorem 6.1 tells us that  $|\alpha(1)| = 10$ , there are four candidates for  $\alpha(1)$ :

$$
\alpha (1) = 1, \quad \alpha (1) = 3, \quad \alpha (1) = 7, \quad \alpha (1) = 9.
$$

To distinguish among the four possibilities, we refine our notation by denoting the mapping that sends 1 to 1 by  $\alpha_{1}$ , 1 to 3 by  $\alpha_{3}$ , 1 to 7 by  $\alpha_{7}$ , and 1 to 9 by  $\alpha_{9}$ . So the only possibilities for  $\operatorname{Aut}(Z_{10})$  are  $\alpha_{1}$ ,  $\alpha_{3}$ ,  $\alpha_{7}$ , and  $\alpha_{9}$ . But are all these automorphisms? Clearly,  $\alpha_{1}$  is the identity. Let us check  $\alpha_{3}$ . Since  $x \bmod 10 = y \bmod 10$  implies  $3x \bmod 10 = 3y \bmod 10$ ,  $\alpha_{3}$  is well defined. Moreover, because  $a_{3}(1) = 3$  is a generator of  $Z_{10}$ , it follows that  $\alpha_{3}$  is onto (and, by Exercise 13 in Chapter 5, it is also one-to-one). Finally, since  $\alpha_{3}(a + b) = 3(a + b) = 3a + 3b = \alpha_{3}(a) + \alpha_{3}(b)$ , we see that  $\alpha_{3}$  is operation-preserving as well. Thus,  $\alpha_{3} \in \operatorname{Aut}(Z_{10})$ . The same argument shows that  $\alpha_{7}$  and  $\alpha_{9}$  are also automorphisms.

This gives us the elements of  $\operatorname{Aut}(Z_{10})$  but not the structure. For instance, what is  $\alpha_{3}\alpha_{3}$ ? Well,  $(\alpha_{3}\alpha_{3})(1) = \alpha_{3}(3) = 3 \cdot 3 = 9 = \alpha_{9}(1)$ , so  $\alpha_{3}\alpha_{3} = \alpha_{9}$ . Similar calculations show that  $\alpha_{3}^{3} = \alpha_{7}$  and  $\alpha_{3}^{4} = \alpha_{1}$ , so that  $|\alpha_{3}| = 4$ . Thus,  $\operatorname{Aut}(Z_{10})$  is cyclic. Actually, the following Cayley tables reveal that  $\operatorname{Aut}(Z_{10})$  is isomorphic to  $U(10)$ .

<table><tr><td>U(10)</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>7</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>7</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>9</td><td>1</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>7</td><td>1</td><td>9</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>9</td><td>7</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr></table>

<table><tr><td>\( \operatorname{Aut}(Z_{10}) \)</td><td>\( \alpha_1 \)</td><td>\( \alpha_3 \)</td><td>\( \alpha_7 \)</td><td>\( \alpha_9 \)</td></tr><tr><td>\( \alpha_1 \)</td><td>\( \alpha_1 \)</td><td>\( \alpha_3 \)</td><td>\( \alpha_7 \)</td><td>\( \alpha_9 \)</td></tr><tr><td>\( \alpha_3 \)</td><td>\( \alpha_3 \)</td><td>\( \alpha_9 \)</td><td>\( \alpha_1 \)</td><td>\( \alpha_7 \)</td></tr><tr><td>\( \alpha_7 \)</td><td>\( \alpha_7 \)</td><td>\( \alpha_1 \)</td><td>\( \alpha_9 \)</td><td>\( \alpha_3 \)</td></tr><tr><td>\( \alpha_9 \)</td><td>\( \alpha_9 \)</td><td>\( \alpha_7 \)</td><td>\( \alpha_3 \)</td><td>\( \alpha_1 \)</td></tr></table>

With Example 14 as a guide, we are now ready to tackle the group  $\operatorname{Aut}(Z_n)$ . The result is particularly nice, since it relates the two kinds of groups we have most frequently encountered thus far—the cyclic groups  $Z_n$  and the  $U$ -groups  $U(n)$ .

# Theorem 6.4  $\operatorname{Aut}(Z_n) \approx U(n)$

# For every positive integer  $n$ ,  $\operatorname{Aut}(Z_n)$  is isomorphic to  $U(n)$ .

PROOF As in Example 14, any automorphism  $\alpha$  is determined by the value of  $\alpha(1)$ , and  $\alpha(1) \in U(n)$ . Now consider the correspondence from  $\operatorname{Aut}(Z_n)$  to  $U(n)$  given by  $T: \alpha \to \alpha(1)$ . The fact that  $\alpha(k) = k\alpha(1)$  implies that  $T$  is a one-to-one mapping. For if  $\alpha$  and  $\beta$  belong to  $\operatorname{Aut}(Z_n)$  and  $\alpha(1) = \beta(1)$ , then  $\alpha(k) = k\alpha(1) = k\beta(1) = \beta(k)$  for all  $k$  in  $Z_n$ , and therefore  $\alpha = \beta$ .

To prove that  $T$  is onto, let  $r \in U(n)$  and consider the mapping  $\alpha$  from  $Z_{n}$  to  $Z_{n}$  defined by  $\alpha(s) = sr$  (mod  $n$ ) for all  $s$  in  $Z_{n}$ . We leave it as an exercise to verify that  $\alpha$  is an automorphism of  $Z_{n}$  (see Exercise 31). Then, since  $T(\alpha) = \alpha(1) = r$ ,  $T$  is onto  $U(n)$ .

Finally, we establish the fact that  $T$  is operation-preserving. Let  $\alpha, \beta \in \operatorname{Aut}(Z_n)$ . We then have

$$
\begin{array}{l} T (\alpha \beta) = (\alpha \beta) (1) = \alpha (\beta (1)) = \alpha (\underbrace {1 + 1 + \cdots + 1} _ {\beta (1)}) \\ = \underbrace {\alpha (1) + \alpha (1) + \cdots + \alpha (1)} _ {\beta (1)} = \alpha (1) \beta (1). \\ = T (\alpha) T (\beta). \\ \end{array}
$$

This completes the proof.

# Cayley's Theorem

Our final theorem is a classic result of Cayley. An important generalization of it will be given in Chapter 24.

# Theorem 6.5 Cayley's Theorem (1854)

# Every group is isomorphic to a group of permutations.

PROOF To prove this, let  $G$  be any group. We must find a group  $\overline{G}$  of permutations that we believe is isomorphic to  $G$ . Since  $G$  is all we have to work with, we will have to use it to construct  $\overline{G}$ . For any  $g$  in  $G$ , define a function  $T_g$  from  $G$  to  $G$  by

$$
T _ {g} (x) = g x \qquad \text {f o r a l l} x \text {i n} G.
$$

(In words,  $T_g$  is just multiplication by  $g$  on the left.) We leave it as an exercise (Exercise 37) to prove that  $T_g$  is a permutation on the set of elements of  $G$ . Now, let  $\overline{G} = \{T_g \mid g \in G\}$ . Then,  $\overline{G}$  is a group under the operation of function composition. To verify this, we first observe that for any  $g$  and  $h$  in  $G$  we have  $T_g T_h(x) = T_g (T_h(x)) = T_g(hx) = g(hx) = (gh)x = T_{gh}(x)$ , so that  $T_g T_h = T_{gh}$ . From this it follows that  $T_e$  is the identity and  $(T_g)^{-1} = T_{g^{-1}}$  (see Exercise 9). Since function composition is associative, we have verified all the conditions for  $\overline{G}$  to be a group.

The isomorphism  $\phi$  between  $G$  and  $\overline{G}$  is now ready-made. For every  $g$  in  $G$ , define  $\phi(g) = T_g$ . If  $T_g = T_h$ , then  $T_g(e) = T_h(e)$  or  $ge = he$ . Thus,  $g = h$  and  $\phi$  is one-to-one. By the way  $\overline{G}$  was constructed, we see that  $\phi$  is onto. The only condition that remains to be checked is that  $\phi$  is operation-preserving. To this end, let  $a$  and  $b$  belong to  $G$ . Then

$$
\phi (a b) = T _ {a b} = T _ {a} T _ {b} = \phi (a) \phi (b).
$$

The group  $\overline{G}$  constructed previously is called the left regular representation of  $G$ .

EXAMPLE 15 For concreteness, let us calculate the left regular representation  $\overline{U(12)}$  for  $U(12) = \{1, 5, 7, 11\}$ . Writing the permutations of  $U(12)$  in array form, we have (remember,  $T_x$  is just multiplication by  $x$ )

$$
T _ {1} = \left[ \begin{array}{c c c c} 1 & 5 & 7 & 1 1 \\ 1 & 5 & 7 & 1 1 \end{array} \right], \quad T _ {5} = \left[ \begin{array}{c c c c} 1 & 5 & 7 & 1 1 \\ 5 & 1 & 1 1 & 7 7 \end{array} \right],
$$

$$
T _ {7} = \left[ \begin{array}{c c c c} 1 & 5 & 7 & 1 1 \\ 7 & 1 1 & 1 & 5 \end{array} \right], \quad T _ {1 1} = \left[ \begin{array}{c c c c} 1 & 5 & 7 & 1 1 \\ 1 1 & 7 & 5 & 1 \end{array} \right].
$$

It is instructive to compare the Cayley tables for  $U(12)$  and its left regular representation  $\overline{U(12)}$ .

<table><tr><td>U(12)</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>7</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>7</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>11</td><td>7</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>7</td><td>11</td><td>1</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>11</td><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>1</td></tr></table>

<table><tr><td>U(12)</td><td>T1</td><td>T5</td><td>T7</td><td>T11</td></tr><tr><td>T1</td><td>T1</td><td>T5</td><td>T7</td><td>T11</td></tr><tr><td>T5</td><td>T5</td><td>T1</td><td>T11</td><td>T7</td></tr><tr><td>T7</td><td>T7</td><td>T11</td><td>T1</td><td>T5</td></tr><tr><td>T11</td><td>T11</td><td>T7</td><td>T5</td><td>T1</td></tr></table>

It should be abundantly clear from these tables that  $U(12)$  and  $\overline{U(12)}$  are only notationally different.

EXAMPLE 16 Writing the left regular representations for the permutations  $T_{R_{270}}$  and  $T_H$  from  $D_4$  in disjoint cycle form we have (see the Cayley table in Chapter 1):

$$
T _ {R _ {2 7 0}} = \left(R _ {0} R _ {2 7 0} R _ {1 8 0} R _ {9 0}\right) \left(H D ^ {\prime}\right) (V D)
$$

$$
T _ {H} = (R _ {0} H) (R _ {9 0} D) (R _ {1 8 0} V) (T _ {2 7 0} D ^ {\prime}).
$$

Our final example demonstrates how one can prove something about an abstract group by viewing it as a permutation group. More examples of this are in Chapter 24.

EXAMPLE 17 Let  $G$  be a group of order  $2n$  where  $n$  is odd. We show that if  $G$  has an element of order 2, then  $G$  has a subgroup of order  $n$ .<sup>2</sup>

Let  $a$  be an element in  $G$  of order 2. Then, viewing  $G$  as a group of permutations, we know that when the right regular permutation  $T_{a}$  of  $a$  is written in disjoint cycle form, every cycle is a 2-cycle or a 1-cycle. But if there were some 1-cycle  $(i)$ , then  $T_{a}(i) = ai = i$ , which, by cancellation, gives us the contradiction that  $a = e$ . So,  $T_{a}$  consists of exactly  $n$  2-cycles, which means that  $T_{a}$  is an odd permutation. Using the argument given Theorem 5.7 that exactly half the elements in  $S_{n}$  are even, we have that exactly half the elements of  $G$  are even. Since the product of two even permutations is even, we know that the set of even permutations in  $G$  is a subgroup of  $G$ .

Cayley's Theorem is important for two contrasting reasons. One is that it allows us to represent an abstract group in a concrete way. A second is that it shows that the present-day set of axioms we have adopted for a group is the correct abstraction of its much earlier predecessor—a group of permutations. Indeed, Cayley's Theorem tells us that abstract groups are not different from permutation groups. Rather, it is the viewpoint that is different. It is this difference of viewpoint that has stimulated the tremendous progress in group theory and many other branches of mathematics in the past 100 years.

It is sometimes very difficult to prove or disprove, whichever the case may be, that two particular groups are isomorphic. For example, it requires somewhat sophisticated techniques to prove the surprising fact that the group of real numbers under addition is isomorphic to the group of complex numbers under addition. Likewise, it is not easy to prove the fact that the group of nonzero complex numbers under multiplication is isomorphic to the group of complex numbers with absolute value of 1 under multiplication. In geometric terms, this says that, as groups, the punctured plane and the unit circle are isomorphic.

This automorphism is called inversion. Describe the action of  $\phi$  geometrically.

45. Consider the following statement: The order of a subgroup divides the order of the group. Suppose you could prove this for finite permutation groups. Would the statement then be true for all finite groups? Explain.

46. Suppose that  $G$  is a finite Abelian group and  $G$  has no element of order 2. Show that the mapping  $g \to g^2$  is an automorphism of  $G$ .

54. Let  $G$  be a group. Complete the following statement:  $|\operatorname{Inn}(G)| = 1$  if and only if

55. In  $S_6$  use the subgroup  $H = \{(1), (135), (153), (35)(26), (15)(26), (13)(26)\}$  to find two other subgroups of order 6 in  $S_6$ .

Explain why this means that  $|\operatorname{Aut}(D_{n})|$  is at most  $n|U(n)|$ . (With some extra effort one can show  $|\operatorname{Aut}(D_{n})| = n|U(n)|$ ).  
66. Prove that for odd  $n$ ,  $|\mathrm{Inn}(D_n)| = 2n$ , and for even  $n$ ,  $|\mathrm{Inn}(D_n)| = n$ .

Cayley is forging the weapons for future generations of physicists.

ARTHUR CAYLEY was born on August 16, 1821, in England. His genius showed itself at an early age. He published his first research paper while an undergraduate of 20, and in the next year he published eight papers. While still in his early 20s, he originated the concept of  $n$ -dimensional geometry.

After graduating from Trinity College, Cambridge, Cayley stayed on for three years as a tutor. At the age of 25, he began a 14-year career as a lawyer. During this period, he published approximately 200 mathematical papers, many of which are now classics. In 1863, Cayley accepted the newly established Sadlerian professorship of mathematics at Cambridge University.

He spent the rest of his life in that position. One of his notable accomplishments was his role in the successful effort to have women admitted to Cambridge. Among Cayley's many innovations in mathematics were the notions of an abstract group and a group algebra, and the matrix concept. He made major contributions to geometry and linear algebra. Cayley and his lifelong friend and collaborator J. J. Sylvester were the founders of the theory of invariants, which was later to play an important role in the theory of relativity.

Cayley's collected works comprise 13 volumes, each about 600 pages in length. He died on January 26, 1895.

# Cosets and Lagrange's Theorem

It might be difficult, at this point, for students to see the extreme importance of this result [Lagrange's Theorem]. As we penetrate the subject more deeply they will become more and more aware of its basic character.

I. N. Herstein, Topics in Algebra

Lagrange's Theorem is extremely important and justly famous in group theory.

Norman J. Block, Abstract Algebra with Applications

# Properties of Cosets

In this chapter, we will prove the single most important theorem in finite group theory—Lagrange's Theorem. In his book on abstract algebra, I. N. Herstein likened it to the ABC's for finite groups. But first we introduce a new and powerful tool for analyzing a group—the notion of a coset. This notion was invented by Galois in 1830, although the term was coined by G. A. Miller in 1910.

# Definitions Coset of  $H$  in  $G$

Let  $G$  be a group and let  $H$  be a nonempty subset of  $G$ . For any  $a \in G$ , the set  $\{ah \mid h \in H\}$  is denoted by  $aH$ . Analogously,  $Ha = \{ha \mid h \in H\}$  and  $aHa^{-1} = \{aha^{-1} \mid h \in H\}$ . When  $H$  is a subgroup of  $G$ , the set  $aH$  is called the left coset of  $H$  in  $G$  containing  $a$ , whereas  $Ha$  is called the right coset of  $H$  in  $G$  containing  $a$ . In this case, the element  $a$  is called the coset representative of  $aH$  (or  $Ha$ ). We use  $|aH|$  to denote the number of elements in the set  $aH$ , and  $|Ha|$  to denote the number of elements in  $Ha$ .

EXAMPLE 1 Let  $G = S_3$  and  $H = \{(1), (13)\}$ . Then the left cosets of  $H$  in  $G$  are:

(1)  $H = H$

$$
\begin{array}{l} (1 2) H = \{(1 2), (1 2) (1 3) \} = \{(1 2), (1 3 2) \} = (1 3 2) H, \\ (1 3) H = \{(1 3), (1) \} = H, \\ (2 3) H = \{(2 3), (2 3) (1 3) \} = \{(2 3), (1 2 3) \} = (1 2 3) H. \\ \end{array}
$$

EXAMPLE 2 Let  $\mathcal{K} = \{R_0, R_{180}\}$ , in  $D_4$ , the dihedral group of order 8. Then,

$$
\begin{array}{l} R _ {0} \mathcal {K} = \mathcal {K}, \\ R _ {9 0} \mathcal {K} = \left\{R _ {9 0}, R _ {2 7 0} \right\} = R _ {2 7 0} \mathcal {K}, \\ R _ {1 8 0} \mathcal {K} = \left\{R _ {1 8 0}, R _ {0} \right\} = \mathcal {K}, \\ V \mathcal {K} = \{V, H \} = H \mathcal {K}, \\ D \mathcal {K} = \left\{D, D ^ {\prime} \right\} = D ^ {\prime} \mathcal {K}. \\ \end{array}
$$

EXAMPLE 3 Let  $H = \{0, 3, 6\}$  in  $Z_{9}$  under addition. In the case that the group operation is addition, we use the notation  $a + H$  instead of  $aH$ . Then the cosets of  $H$  in  $Z_{9}$  are

$$
\begin{array}{l} 0 + H = \{0, 3, 6 \} = 3 + H = 6 + H, \\ 1 + H = \{1, 4, 7 \} = 4 + H = 7 + H, \\ 2 + H = \{2, 5, 8 \} = 5 + H = 8 + H. \\ \end{array}
$$

The three preceding examples illustrate a few facts about cosets that are worthy of our attention. First, cosets are usually not subgroups. Second,  $aH$  may be the same as  $bH$ , even though  $a$  is not the same as  $b$ . Third, since in Example 1 (12)  $H = \{(12), (132)\}$  whereas  $H(12) = \{(12), (123)\}$ ,  $aH$  need not be the same as  $Ha$ .

These examples and observations raise many questions. When does  $aH = bH$ ? Do  $aH$  and  $bH$  have any elements in common? When does  $aH = Ha$ ? Which cosets are subgroups? Why are cosets important? The next lemma and theorem answer these questions. (Analogous results hold for right cosets.)

# Lemma 7.1 Properties of Cosets

Let  $H$  be a subgroup of  $G$ , and let  $a$  and  $b$  belong to  $G$ . Then,

1.  $a \in aH$ .  
2.  $aH = H$  if and only if  $a \in H$ .  
3.  $(ab)H = a(bH)$  and  $H(ab) = (Ha)b$  
4.  $aH = bH$  if and only if  $a \in bH$ .

5.  $aH = bH$  or  $aH\cap bH = \varnothing$  
6.  $aH = bH$  if and only if  $a^{-1}b \in H$ .  
7.  $|aH| = |bH|$ .  
8.  $aH = Ha$  if and only if  $H = aHa^{-1}$  
9.  $aH$  is a subgroup of  $G$  if and only if  $a \in H$ .

# PROOF

1.  $a = ae\in aH$  
2. To verify property 2, we first suppose that  $aH = H$ . Then  $a = ae \in aH = H$ . Next, we assume that  $a \in H$  and show that  $aH \subseteq H$  and  $H \subseteq aH$ . The first inclusion follows directly from the closure of  $H$ . To show that  $H \subseteq aH$ , let  $h \in H$ . Then, since  $a \in H$  and  $h \in H$ , we know that  $a^{-1}h \in H$ . Thus,  $h = eh = (aa^{-1})h = a(a^{-1}h) \in aH$ .  
3. This follows directly from  $(ab)h = a(bh)$  and  $h(ab) = (ha)b$ .  
4. If  $aH = bH$ , then  $a = ae \in aH = bH$ . Conversely, if  $a \in bH$  we have  $a = bh$  where  $h \in H$ , and therefore  $aH = (bh)H = b(hH) = bH$ .  
5. Property 5 follows directly from property 4, for if there is an element  $c$  in  $aH \cap bH$ , then  $cH = aH$  and  $cH = bH$ .  
6. Observe that  $aH = bH$  if and only if  $H = a^{-1}bH$ . The result now follows from property 2.  
7. To prove that  $|aH| = |bH|$ , it suffices to define a one-to-one mapping from  $aH$  onto  $bH$ . Obviously, the correspondence  $ah \to bh$  maps  $aH$  onto  $bH$ . That it is one-to-one follows directly from the cancellation property.  
8. Note that  $aH = Ha$  if and only if  $(aH)a^{-1} = (Ha)a^{-1} = H(aa^{-1}) = H$  — that is, if and only if  $aHa^{-1} = H$ .  
9. If  $aH$  is a subgroup, then it contains the identity  $e$ . Thus,  $aH \cap eH \neq \emptyset$ ; and, by property 5, we have  $aH = eH = H$ . Thus, from property 2, we have  $a \in H$ . Conversely, if  $a \in H$ , then, again by property 2,  $aH = H$ .

Although most mathematical theorems are written in symbolic form, one should also know what they say in words. In the preceding lemma, property 1 says simply that the left coset of  $H$  containing  $a$  does contain  $a$ . Property 2 says that the  $H$  "absorbs" an element if and only if the element belongs to  $H$ . Property 3 says that the left coset of  $H$  created by multiplying  $H$  on the left by  $ab$  is the same as the one created by multiplying  $H$  on the left by  $b$  then multiplying the resulting coset  $bH$  on the left by  $a$  (and analogously for multiplication on the right by  $ab$ ). Property 4 shows that a left coset of  $H$  is uniquely determined by any one of its elements. In particular, any element of a left coset can be used to represent the coset. Property 5 says—and this is very important—that two left cosets of  $H$  are either identical or disjoint. Thus, a left coset of  $H$  is uniquely determined by any one of its elements. In particular, any element of a left coset can be used to represent the coset. Property 6 shows how we may transfer a question about equality of left cosets of  $H$  to a question about  $H$  itself and vice versa. Property 7 says that all left cosets of  $H$  have the same size. Property 8 is analogous to property 6 in that it shows how a question about the equality of the left and right cosets of  $H$  containing  $a$  is equivalent to a question about the equality of two subgroups

of  $G$ . The last property of the lemma says that  $H$  itself is the only coset of  $H$  that is a subgroup of  $G$ .

Note that properties 1, 5, and 7 of the lemma guarantee that the left cosets of a subgroup  $H$  of  $G$  partition  $G$  into blocks of equal size. Indeed, we may view the cosets of  $H$  as a partitioning of  $G$  into equivalence classes under the equivalence relation defined by  $a \sim b$  if  $aH = bH$  (see Theorem 0.7).

Cosets of groups allow us to organize the group elements in a coherent way with every element of each coset sharing a special property. In particular, the subgroup  $H$  is often chosen so that the cosets partition the group in some highly desirable fashion. For example, if  $G$  is 3-space  $\mathbf{R}^3$  and  $H$  is a plane through the origin, then the coset  $(a, b, c) + H$  (addition is done componentwise) is the plane passing through the point  $(a, b, c)$  and parallel to  $H$ . Thus, the cosets of  $H$  constitute a partition of 3-space into planes parallel to  $H$ . If  $G = GL(2, \mathbf{R})$  and  $H = SL(2, \mathbf{R})$ , then for any matrix  $A$  in  $G$ , the coset  $AH$  is the set of all  $2 \times 2$  matrices with the same determinant as  $A$ . Thus,

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{c c} 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{array} \right] H \quad \text {i s t h e s e t o f a l l 2 \times 2 m a t r i c e s o f d e t e r m i n a n t 2}
$$

and

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{c c} 1 & 2 \\ 2 & 1 \end{array} \right] H \quad \text {i s t h e s e t o f a l l} 2 \times 2 \text {m a t r i c e s o f d e t e r m i n a n t} - 3.
$$

Similarly, it follows from Example 16 of Chapter 2 and Property 7 of complex numbers in Chapter 0 that if  $a + bi = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$  ( $\cos \theta + i \sin \theta$ ) the set of  $n$  roots of  $a + bi$  is the coset of  $\left\langle \cos \frac{360^\circ}{n} + i \sin \frac{360^\circ}{n} \right\rangle$  that contains  $\sqrt[n]{a^2 + b^2} \left( \cos \frac{\theta}{n} + i \sin \frac{\theta}{n} \right)$ .

Property 5 of the lemma is useful for actually finding the distinct cosets of a subgroup. We illustrate this in the next example.

EXAMPLE 4 To find the cosets of  $H = \{1, 15\}$  in  $G = U(32) = \{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31\}$ , we begin with  $H = \{1, 15\}$ . We can find a second coset by choosing any element not in  $H$ , say 3, as a coset representative. This gives the coset  $3H = \{3, 13\}$ . We find our next coset by choosing a representative not already appearing in the two previously chosen cosets, say 5. This gives us the coset  $5H = \{5, 11\}$ . We continue to form cosets by picking elements from  $U(32)$  that have not yet appeared in the previous cosets as representatives of the cosets until we have accounted for every element of  $U(32)$ . We then have the complete list of all distinct cosets of  $H$ .

# Lagrange's Theorem and Consequences

And now, the all-important Lagrange's Theorem that has been around for more than 200 years—longer than group theory itself! (This theorem was not originally stated in group theoretic terms.) At this stage, it should come as no surprise.

# Theorem 7.1 Lagrange's Theorem:  $|H|$  Divides  $|G|$

If  $G$  is a finite group and  $H$  is a subgroup of  $G$ , then  $|H|$  divides  $|G|$ . Moreover, the number of distinct left (right) cosets of  $H$  in  $G$  is  $|G| / |H|$ .

PROOF Let  $a_1H, a_2H, \ldots, a_rH$  denote the distinct left cosets of  $H$  in  $G$ . Then, for each  $a$  in  $G$ , we have  $aH = a_iH$  for some  $i$ . Also, by property 1 of the lemma,  $a \in aH$ . Thus, each member of  $G$  belongs to one of the cosets  $a_iH$ . In symbols,

$$
G = a _ {1} H \cup \dots \cup a _ {r} H.
$$

Now, property 5 of the lemma shows that this union is disjoint, so that

$$
| G | = \left| a _ {1} H \right| + \left| a _ {2} H \right| + \dots + \left| a _ {r} H \right|.
$$

Finally, since  $|a_{i}H| = |H|$  for each  $i$ , we have  $|G| = r|H|$ .

We pause to emphasize that Lagrange's Theorem is a subgroup candidate criterion; that is, it provides a list of candidates for the orders of the subgroups of a group. Thus, a group of order 12 may have subgroups of order 12, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1, but no others. Warning! The converse of Lagrange's Theorem is false. For example, a group of order 12 need not have a subgroup of order 6. We prove this in Example 5.

As we shall see in later chapters there are several theorems that guarantee the existence of subgroups of certain particular orders in finite groups.

A special name and notation have been adopted for the number of left (or right) cosets of a subgroup in a group. The index of a subgroup  $H$  in  $G$  is the number of distinct left cosets of  $H$  in  $G$ . This number is denoted by  $|G:H|$ . As an immediate consequence of the proof of Lagrange's Theorem, we have the following useful formula for the number of distinct left (or right) cosets of  $H$  in  $G$ .

# Corollary 1  $|G:H| = |G| / |H|$

If  $G$  is a finite group and  $H$  is a subgroup of  $G$ , then  $|G:H| = |G| / |H|$ .

# Corollary 2  $|a|$  Divides  $|G|$

In a finite group, the order of each element of the group divides the order of the group.

PROOF Recall that the order of an element is the order of the subgroup generated by that element.

# Corollary 3 Groups of Prime Order Are Cyclic

Every group of prime order is isomorphic to  $Z_{p}$

PROOF Suppose that  $G$  has prime order and let  $a \in G$  and  $a \neq e$ . Then,  $|\langle a \rangle|$  divides  $p$  and  $|\langle a \rangle| \neq 1$ . Thus,  $|\langle a \rangle| = |G|$  and the corollary follows from Example 2 of Chapter 6.

# Corollary 4  $a^{|G|} = e$

Let  $G$  be a finite group, and let  $a \in G$ . Then,  $a^{|G|} = e$ .

PROOF By Corollary 2,  $|G| = |a|k$  for some positive integer  $k$ . Thus,  $a^{|G|} = a^{|a|k} = e^{k} = e$ .

# Corollary 5 Fermat's Little Theorem

For every integer  $a$  and every prime  $p$ ,  $a^p \mod p = a \mod p$ .

PROOF By the division algorithm,  $a = pm + r$ , where  $0 \leq r < p$ . Thus,  $a \mod p = r$ , and it suffices to prove that  $r^p \mod p = r$ . If  $r = 0$ , the result is trivial, so we may assume that  $r \in U(p)$ . [Recall that  $U(p) = \{1, 2, \dots, p - 1\}$  under multiplication modulo  $p$ .] Then, by the preceding corollary,  $r^{p - 1} \mod p = 1$  and, therefore,  $r^p \mod p = r$ .

Fermat's Little Theorem has been used in conjunction with computers to test for primality of certain numbers. One case concerned the number  $p = 2^{257} - 1$ . If  $p$  is prime, then we know from Fermat's Little Theorem that  $10^p \mod p = 10 \mod p$  and, therefore,  $10^{p + 1} \mod p = 100 \mod p$ . Using multiple precision and a simple loop, a computer was able to calculate  $10^{p + 1} \mod p = 10^{2^{257}} \mod p$  in a few seconds. The result was not 100, and so  $p$  is not prime.

EXAMPLE 5 The Converse of Lagrange's Theorem Is False<sup>2</sup> The group  $A_4$  of order 12 has no subgroups of order 6. To verify this, recall that  $A_4$  has eight elements of order 3 ( $\alpha_5$  through  $\alpha_{12}$ , in the notation of Table 5.1) and suppose that  $H$  is a subgroup of order 6. Let  $a$  be any element of order 3 in  $A_4$ . If  $a$  is not in  $H$ , then  $A_4 = H \cup aH$ . But then  $a^2$  is in  $H$  or  $a^2$  is in  $aH$ . If  $a^2$  is in  $H$  then so is  $(a^2)^2 = a^4 = a$ , so this case is ruled out. If  $a^2$  is in  $aH$ , then  $a^2 = ah$  for some  $h$  in  $H$ , but this also implies that  $a$  is in  $H$ . This argument shows that any subgroup of  $A_4$  of order 6 must contain all eight elements of  $A_4$  of order 3, which is absurd.

Lagrange's Theorem demonstrates that the finiteness of a group imposes severe restrictions on the possible orders of subgroups. The next theorem is

a counting technique that also places severe limits on the existence of certain subgroups in finite groups.

# Theorem 7.2  $|HK| = |H||K| / |H \cap K|$

For two finite subgroups  $H$  and  $K$  of a group, define the set  $HK = \{hk \mid h \in H, k \in K\}$ . Then  $|HK| = |H||K| / |H \cap K|$ .

PROOF Although the set  $HK$  has  $|H||K|$  products, not all of these products need represent distinct group elements. That is, we may have  $hk = h'k'$  where  $h \neq h'$  and  $k \neq k'$ . To determine  $|HK|$ , we must find the extent to which this happens. For every  $t$  in  $H \cap K$ , the product  $hk = (ht)(t^{-1}k)$ , so each group element in  $HK$  is represented by at least  $|H \cap K|$  products in  $HK$ . But  $hk = h'k'$  implies  $t = h^{-1}h' = kk'^{-1} \in H \cap K$ , so that  $h' = ht$  and  $k' = t^{-1}k$ . Thus, each element in  $HK$  is represented by exactly  $|H \cap K|$  products. So,  $|HK| = |H||K| / |H \cap K|$ .

One might wonder if  $H$  and  $K$  are subgroups of a group  $G$ , is  $HK$  a subgroup of  $G$ . Not so! (This is Exercise 6.)

A good way to measure the value of a theorem is to see how it allows us to easily draw conclusions that were previously not apparent. The next two examples and Theorem 7.3 illustrate how valuable Theorem 7.2 is in this regard.

EXAMPLE 6 A group of order 75 can have at most one subgroup of order 25. (It is shown in Chapter 23 that every group of order 75 has a subgroup of order 25). To see that a group of order 75 cannot have two subgroups of order 25, suppose  $H$  and  $K$  are two such subgroups. Since  $|H \cap K|$  divides  $|H| = 25$  and  $|H \cap K| = 1$  or 5 results in  $|HK| = |H||K| / |H \cap K| = 25 \cdot 25 / |H \cap K| = 625$  or 125 elements, we have that  $|H \cap K| = 25$  and therefore  $H = K$ .

EXAMPLE 7 An Abelian group  $G$  of order 42 can have at most one subgroup of order 6. (It is shown in Chapter 11 that every Abelian group of order 42 is cyclic.) To verify this, suppose that  $H$  and  $K$  are two distinct subgroups of order 6. Then  $|H \cap K| = 1$ , 2 or 3 and, by Example 7 from Chapter 3, we have that  $HK$  is a subgroup of  $G$  of order  $|HK| = 36 / |H \cap K| = 36$ , 18 or 12, none of which divides 42. This contradicts Lagrange's Theorem.

For any prime  $p > 2$ , we know that  $Z_{2p}$  and  $D_p$  are nonisomorphic groups of order  $2p$ . This naturally raises the question of whether there could be other possible groups of these orders. Remarkably, with just the simple machinery available to us at this point, we can answer this question.

# Theorem 7.3 Classification of Groups of Order  $2p$

Let  $G$  be a group of order  $2p$ , where  $p$  is a prime greater than 2. Then  $G$  is isomorphic to  $Z_{2p}$  or  $D_p$ .

PROOF We assume that  $G$  does not have an element of order  $2p$  and show that  $G \approx D_p$ . We begin by first showing that  $G$  must have an element of order  $p$ . By our assumption and Lagrange's Theorem, any nonidentity element of  $G$  must have order 2 or  $p$ . Thus, to verify our assertion, we may assume that every nonidentity element of  $G$  has order 2. In this case, we have for all  $a$  and  $b$  in the group  $ab = (ab)^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1} = ba$ , so that  $G$  is Abelian. Then, for any nonidentity elements  $a, b \in G$  with  $a \neq b$ , the set  $\{e, a, b, ab\}$  is closed and therefore is a subgroup of  $G$  of order 4. Since this contradicts Lagrange's Theorem, we have proved that  $G$  must have an element of order  $p$ ; call it  $a$ .

Now let  $b$  be any element not in  $\langle a \rangle$ . Then by Lagrange's Theorem and our assumption that  $G$  does not have an element of order  $2p$ , we have that  $|b| = 2$  or  $p$ . Because  $|\langle a \rangle \cap \langle b \rangle|$  divides  $|\langle a \rangle| = p$  and  $\langle a \rangle \neq \langle b \rangle$  we have that  $|\langle a \rangle \cap \langle b \rangle| = 1$ . But then  $|b| = 2$ , for otherwise, by Theorem 7.2  $|\langle a \rangle \langle b \rangle| = |\langle a \rangle||\langle b \rangle| = p^2 > 2p = |G|$ , which is impossible. So, any element of  $G$  not in  $\langle a \rangle$  has order 2.

At this point we now know that  $G = \langle a \rangle \cup \langle a \rangle b = \{e, a, a^2, \ldots, a^{p-1}, b, ab, a^2b, \ldots, a^{p-1}b\}$ . To complete the proof all we need do is the prove that there is only one way that the multiplication table for  $G$  can be constructed. (If there were two non-isomorphic noncyclic groups of order  $2p$  their multiplication tables would differ.) Since  $ab \notin \langle a \rangle$  we know  $|ab| = 2$ . Thus  $abab = e$  and therefore  $bab = a^{-1}$ . Using the fact that  $b^2 = e$  we have that  $a^{-j} = (a^{-1})^j = (bab)^j$ . In the Cayley table there are three kinds of products in  $G$ :  $a^i a^j = a^{i+j}$ ;  $a^i(a^j b) = a^{i+j} b$ ; and  $(a^i b)(a^j b) = a^i(ba^j)b = a^i(a^{-j}b)b = a^{i-j}$ . This shows that when  $p > 2$  is a prime the multiplication table for a group of order  $2p$  is uniquely determined by the two conditions that  $G$  has an element of order  $2p$  or does not have one.

As an immediate corollary, we have that the non-Abelian groups  $S_3$ , the symmetric group of degree 3, and  $GL(2,Z_2)$ , the group of  $2 \times 2$  matrices with nonzero determinants with entries from  $Z_2$  (see Example 19 and Exercise 47 in Chapter 2) are isomorphic to  $D_3$ .

# An Application of Cosets to Permutation Groups

Lagrange's Theorem and its corollaries dramatically demonstrate the fruitfulness of the coset concept. We next consider an application of cosets to permutation groups.

# Definition Stabilizer of a Point

Let  $G$  be a group of permutations of a set  $S$ . For each  $i$  in  $S$ , let  $\operatorname{stab}_G(i) = \{\phi \in G \mid \phi(i) = i\}$ . We call  $\operatorname{stab}_G(i)$  the stabilizer of  $i$  in  $G$ .

The student should verify that  $\operatorname{stab}_G(i)$  is a subgroup of  $G$ . (See Exercise 43 in Chapter 5.)

# Definition Orbit of a Point

Let  $G$  be a group of permutations of a set  $S$ . For each  $i$  in  $S$ , let  $\operatorname{orb}_G(i) = \{\phi(i) \mid \phi \in G\}$ . The set  $\operatorname{orb}_G(i)$  is a subset of  $S$  called the orbit of  $i$  under  $G$ . We use  $|\operatorname{orb}_G(i)|$  to denote the number of elements in  $\operatorname{orb}_G(i)$ .

Example 8 should clarify these two definitions.

EXAMPLE 8 Let  $G$  be the following subgroup of  $S_8$

$$
\begin{array}{l} \{(1), (1 3 2) (4 6 5) (7 8), (1 3 2) (4 6 5), (1 2 3) (4 5 6), \\ (1 2 3) (4 5 6) (7 8), (7 8) \}. \\ \end{array}
$$

Then,

$$
\begin{array}{l} \operatorname {o r b} _ {G} (1) = \{1, 3, 2 \}, \quad \operatorname {s t a b} _ {G} (1) = \{(1), (7 8) \}, \\ \operatorname {o r b} _ {G} (2) = \{2, 1, 3 \}, \quad \operatorname {s t a b} _ {G} (2) = \{(1), (7 8) \}, \\ \operatorname {o r b} _ {G} (4) = \{4, 6, 5 \}, \quad \operatorname {s t a b} _ {G} (4) = \{(1), (7 8) \}, \\ \operatorname {o r b} _ {G} (7) = \{7, 8 \}, \quad \operatorname {s t a b} _ {G} (7) = \{(1), (1 3 2) (4 6 5), (1 2 3) (4 5 6) \}. \\ \end{array}
$$

EXAMPLE 9 We may view  $D_4$  as a group of permutations of a square region. Figure 7.1(a) illustrates the orbit of the point  $p$  under  $D_4$ , and Figure 7.1(b) illustrates the orbit of the point  $q$  under  $D_4$ . Observe that  $\operatorname{stab}_{D_4}(p) = \{R_0, D\}$ , whereas  $\operatorname{stab}_{D_4}(q) = \{R_0\}$ .

The preceding two examples also illustrate the following theorem.

# Theorem 7.4 Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem

Let  $G$  be a finite group of permutations of a set  $S$ . Then, for any  $i$  from  $S$ ,  $|G| = |\operatorname{orb}_G(i)||\operatorname{stab}_G(i)|$ .

PROOF By Lagrange's Theorem,  $|G| / |\operatorname{stab}_G(i)|$  is the number of distinct left cosets of  $\operatorname{stab}_G(i)$  in  $G$ . Thus, it suffices to establish a one-to-one correspondence between the left cosets of  $\operatorname{stab}_G(i)$  and the elements in the orbit of  $i$ . To do this, we define a correspondence  $T$  by mapping the coset  $\phi \operatorname{stab}_G(i)$  to  $\phi(i)$  under  $T$ . To show that  $T$  is a well-defined function, we must show that

$\alpha \mathrm{stab}_G(i) = \beta \mathrm{stab}_G(i)$  implies  $\alpha (i) = \beta (i)$ . But  $\alpha \mathrm{stab}_G(i) = \beta \mathrm{stab}_G(i)$  implies  $\alpha^{-1}\beta \in \mathrm{stab}_G(i)$ , so that  $(\alpha^{-1}\beta)(i) = i$  and, therefore,  $\beta (i) = \alpha (i)$ . Reversing the argument from the last step to the first step shows that  $T$  is also one-to-one. We conclude the proof by showing that  $T$  is onto  $\operatorname{orb}_G(i)$ . Let  $j\in \operatorname{orb}_G(i)$ . Then  $\alpha (i) = j$  for some  $\alpha \in G$  and clearly  $T(\alpha \mathrm{stab}_G(i)) = \alpha (i) = j$ , so that  $T$  is onto.

We leave as an exercise the proof of the important fact that the orbits of the elements of a set  $S$  under a group partition  $S$  (Exercise 67).

One might think that because Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem only applies to permutation groups that it is of limited value but keep in mind that Cayley's Theorem (Theorem 6.5) says that every group is isomorphic to a group of permutations.

# The Rotation Group of a Cube and a Soccer Ball

It cannot be overemphasized that Theorem 7.4 and Lagrange's Theorem (Theorem 7.1) are counting theorems.<sup>3</sup> They enable us to determine the numbers of elements in various sets. To see how Theorem 7.4 works, we will determine the order of the rotation group of a cube and a soccer ball. That is, we wish to find the number of essentially different ways in which we can take a cube or a soccer ball in a certain location in space, physically rotate it, and then have it still occupy its original location.

EXAMPLE 10 Let  $G$  be the rotation group of a cube. Label the six faces of the cube 1 through 6. Since any rotation of the cube must carry each face of the cube to exactly one other face of the cube and different rotations induce different permutations of the faces,  $G$  can be viewed as a group of permutations on the set  $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$ . Clearly, there is some rotation about a central horizontal or vertical axis that carries face number 1 to any other face, so that  $|\mathrm{orb}_G(1)| = 6$ . Next, we consider  $\mathrm{stab}_G(1)$ . Here, we are asking for all rotations of a cube that leave face number 1 where it is. Surely, there are only four such motions—rotations of  $0^\circ$ ,  $90^\circ$ ,  $180^\circ$ , and  $270^\circ$ —about the line perpendicular to the face and passing through its center (see Figure 7.2). Thus, by Theorem 7.4,  $|G| = |\mathrm{orb}_G(1)| |\mathrm{stab}_G(1)| = 6 \cdot 4 = 24$ .

$\beta = (1423)$

Now that we know how many rotations a cube has, it is simple to determine the actual structure of the rotation group of a cube. Recall that  $S_4$  is the symmetric group of degree 4.

# Theorem 7.5 The Rotation Group of a Cube

# The group of rotations of a cube is isomorphic to  $S_4$ .

PROOF Since the group of rotations of a cube has the same order as  $S_4$ , we need only prove that the group of rotations is isomorphic to a subgroup of  $S_4$ . To this end, observe that a cube has four diagonals and that the rotation group induces a group of permutations on the four diagonals. But we must be careful not to assume that different rotations correspond to different permutations. To see that this is so, all we need do is show that all 24 permutations of the diagonals arise from rotations. Labeling the consecutive diagonals 1, 2, 3, and 4, it is obvious that there is a  $90^\circ$  rotation that yields the permutation  $\alpha = (1234)$ ; another  $90^\circ$  rotation about an axis perpendicular to our first axis yields the permutation  $\beta = (1423)$ . See Figure 7.3. So, the group of permutations induced by the rotations contains the eight-element subgroup  $\{\varepsilon, \alpha, \alpha^2, \alpha^3, \beta^2, \beta^2\alpha, \beta^2\alpha^2, \beta^2\alpha^3\}$  (see Exercise 77) and  $\alpha\beta$ , which has order 3. Clearly, then, the rotations yield all 24 permutations, since the order of the rotation group must be divisible by both 8 and 3.

EXAMPLE 11 A traditional soccer ball has 20 faces that are regular hexagons and 12 faces that are regular pentagons. (The technical term for this solid is truncated icosahedron.) To determine the number of rotational symmetries of a soccer ball using Theorem 7.4, we may choose our set  $S$  to be the 20 hexagons or the 12 pentagons. Let us say that  $S$  is the set of 12 pentagons. Since any pentagon can be carried to any other pentagon by some rotation, the orbit of any pentagon is  $S$ . Also, there are five rotations that fix (stabilize) any particular pentagon. Thus, by the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem, there are  $12 \cdot 5 = 60$  rotational symmetries. (In case you are interested, the rotation group of a soccer ball is isomorphic to  $A_{5}$ .)

In 1985, chemists Robert Curl, Richard Smalley, and Harold Kroto caused tremendous excitement in the scientific community when they created a new form of carbon by using a laser beam to vaporize graphite. The structure of the new molecule was composed of 60 carbon atoms arranged in the shape of a soccer ball! Because the shape of the new molecule reminded them of the dome structures built by the architect R. Buckminster Fuller, Curl, Smalley, and Kroto named their discovery "buckyballs." Buckyballs are the roundest, most symmetric large molecules known. Group theory has been particularly useful in illuminating the properties of buckyballs, since the absorption spectrum of a molecule depends on its symmetries and chemists classify various molecular states according to their symmetry properties. The buckyball discovery spurred a revolution in carbon chemistry. In 1996, Curl, Smalley, and Kroto received the Nobel Prize in chemistry for their discovery.

In 2012 a study reported that carbon molecules in the shape of buckyballs may be the cause of mysterious bands seen in light across the Milky Way that have puzzled astronomers for nearly a century and that these molecules are common across the universe.

Let us turn, now, to an interesting application of cosets.

# An Application of Cosets to the Rubik's Cube

Recall from Chapter 5 that in 2010 it was proved via a computer computation, which took 35 CPU-years to complete, that every Rubik's cube could be solved in at most 20 moves. To carry out this effort, the research team of Morley Davidson, John Dethridge, Herbert Kociemba, and Tomas Rokicki applied a program of Rokicki, which built on early work of Kociemba, that checked the elements of the cosets of a subgroup  $H$  of order  $(8! \cdot 8! \cdot 4!) / 2 = 19,508,428,800$  to see if each cube in a position corresponding to the elements in a coset could be solved within 20 moves. In the rare cases where Rokicki's program did not work, an alternate method was employed. Using symmetry considerations, they were able to reduce the approximately 2 billion cosets of  $H$  to about 56 million cosets for testing. Cosets played a role in this effort because Rokicki's program could handle the  $19.5+$  billion elements in the same coset in about 20 seconds.

Lagrange is the Lofty Pyramid of the Mathematical Sciences.

NAPOLEON BONAPARTE

JOSEPH LOUIS LAGRANGE was born in Italy of French ancestry on January 25, 1736. He became captivated by mathematics at an early age when he read an essay by Halley on Newton's calculus. At the age of 19, he became a professor of mathematics at the Royal Artillery School in Turin. Lagrange made significant contributions to many branches of mathematics and physics, among them the theory of numbers, the theory of equations, ordinary and partial differential equations, the calculus of variations, analytic geometry, fluid dynamics, and celestial mechanics. His methods for solving third- and fourth-degree polynomial equations by radicals laid the groundwork for the group theoretic approach to solving polynomials taken by Galois.

Lagrange was a very careful writer with a clear and elegant style. At the age of 40, Lagrange was appointed head of the Berlin Academy, succeeding Euler. In offering this appointment, Frederick the Great proclaimed that the "greatest king in Europe" ought to have the "greatest mathematician in Europe" at his court. In 1787, Lagrange was invited to Paris by Louis XVI and became a good friend of the king and his wife, Marie Antoinette. In 1793, Lagrange headed a commission, which included Laplace and Lavoisier, to devise a new system of weights and measures. Out of this came the metric system. Late in his life he was made a count by Napoleon. Lagrange died on April 10, 1813.

# External Direct Products

The universe is an enormous direct product of representations of symmetry groups.

Steven Weinberg

In many areas of mathematics, there are ways of "building things up" and "breaking things down"

Norman J. Block, Abstract Algebra with Applications

# Definition and Examples

In this chapter, we show how to piece together groups to make larger groups. In Chapter 9, we will show that we can often start with one large group and decompose it into a product of smaller groups in much the same way as a composite positive integer can be broken down into a product of primes. These methods will later be used to give us a simple way to construct all finite Abelian groups.

# Definition External Direct Product

Let  $G_1, G_2, \ldots, G_n$  be a finite collection of groups. The external direct product of  $G_1, G_2, \ldots, G_n$ , written as  $G_1 \oplus G_2 \oplus \dots \oplus G_n$ , is the set of all  $n$ -tuples for which the  $i$ th component is an element of  $G_i$  and the operation is componentwise.

In symbols,

$$
G _ {1} \oplus G _ {2} \oplus \dots \oplus G _ {n} = \left\{\left(g _ {1}, g _ {2}, \dots , g _ {n}\right) \mid g _ {i} \in G _ {i} \right\},
$$

where  $(g_{1}, g_{2}, \ldots, g_{n})(g_{1}', g_{2}', \ldots, g_{n}')$  is defined to be  $(g_{1}g_{1}', g_{2}g_{2}', \ldots, g_{n}g_{n}')$ . It is understood that each product  $g_{i}g_{i}'$  is performed with the operation of  $G_{i}$ . Note that in the case that each  $G_{i}$  is finite, we have by properties of sets that  $|G_{1} \oplus G_{2} \oplus \dots \oplus G_{n}| = |G_{1}||G_{2}|\dots|G_{n}|$ . We leave it to the reader to show that the external direct product of groups is itself a group (Exercise 1).

This construction is not new to students who have had linear algebra or physics. Indeed,  $\mathbf{R}^2 = \mathbf{R} \oplus \mathbf{R}$  and  $\mathbf{R}^3 = \mathbf{R} \oplus \mathbf{R} \oplus \mathbf{R}$ —the operation being componentwise addition. Of course, there is also scalar multiplication, but we ignore this for the time being, since we are interested only in the group structure at this point.

# EXAMPLE 1

$$
\begin{array}{l} U (8) \oplus U (1 0) = \{(1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 7), (1, 9), (3, 1), (3, 3), \\ (3, 7) (3, 9) (5, 1) (5, 3) (5, 7) (5, 9), \\ (7, 1) (7, 3) (7, 7) (7, 9) \}. \\ \end{array}
$$

The product  $(3,7)(7,9) = (5,3)$ , since the first components are combined by multiplication modulo 8, whereas the second components are combined by multiplication modulo 10.

# EXAMPLE 2

$$
Z _ {2} \oplus Z _ {3} = \{(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2) \}.
$$

Clearly, this is an Abelian group of order 6. Is this group related to another Abelian group of order 6 that we know, namely,  $Z_{6}$ ? Consider the subgroup of  $Z_{2} \oplus Z_{3}$  generated by  $(1, 1)$ . Since the operation in each component is addition, we have  $(1, 1) = (1, 1)$ ,  $2(1, 1) = (0, 2)$ ,  $3(1, 1) = (1, 0)$ ,  $4(1, 1) = (0, 1)$ ,  $5(1, 1) = (1, 2)$ , and  $6(1, 1) = (0, 0)$ . Hence  $Z_{2} \oplus Z_{3}$  is cyclic. It follows that  $Z_{2} \oplus Z_{3}$  is isomorphic to  $Z_{6}$ .

In Theorem 7.3 we classified the groups of order  $2p$  where  $p$  is an odd prime. Now that we have defined  $Z_{2} \oplus Z_{2}$ , it is easy to classify the groups of order 4.

# EXAMPLE 3 Classification of Groups of Order 4

A group of order 4 is isomorphic to  $Z_{4}$  or  $Z_{2} \oplus Z_{2}$ . To verify this it suffices to show that for any non-cyclic group  $G$  of order 4 there is only one way to create an operation table for  $G$ . By Lagrange's Theorem the elements of  $G$  have order 1 or 2. Let  $a$  and  $b$  be distinct non-identity elements of  $G$ . By cancellation,  $ab \neq a$  and  $ab \neq b$ . Moreover,  $ab \neq e$ , for otherwise  $a = b^{-1} = b$ . Thus  $G = \{e, a, b, ab\}$ . That the operation table is uniquely determined follows from the observation that  $ab = (ab)^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1} = ba$ .

We see from Examples 2 and 3 that in some cases  $Z_{m} \oplus Z_{n}$  is isomorphic to  $Z_{mn}$  and in some cases it is not. Theorem 8.2 provides a simple characterization for when the isomorphism holds.

# Properties of External Direct Products

Our first theorem gives a simple method for computing the order of an element in a direct product in terms of the orders of the component pieces.

# Theorem 8.1 Order of an Element in a Direct Product

The order of an element in a direct product of a finite number of finite groups is the least common multiple of the orders of the components of the element. In symbols,

$$
| (g _ {1}, g _ {2}, \ldots , g _ {n}) | = \operatorname {l c m} (| g _ {1} |, | g _ {2} |, \ldots , | g _ {n} |).
$$

PROOF Denote the identity of  $G_{i}$  by  $e_{i}$ . Let  $s = \operatorname{lcm}(|g_1|, |g_2|, \ldots, |g_n|)$  and  $t = |(g_1, g_2, \ldots, g_n)|$ . Because  $s$  is a multiple of each  $|g_{i}|$  implies that  $(g_{1}, g_{2}, \ldots, g_{n})^{s} = (g_{1}^{s}, g_{2}^{s}, \ldots, g_{n}^{s}) = (e_{1}, e_{2}, \ldots, e_{n})$ , we know that  $t \leq s$ . On the other hand, from  $(g_{1}^{t}, g_{2}^{t}, \ldots, g_{n}^{t}) = (g_{1}, g_{2}, \ldots, g_{n})^{t} = (e_{1}, e_{2}, \ldots, e_{n})$  we see that  $t$  is a common multiple of  $|g_{1}|, |g_{2}|, \ldots, |g_{n}|$ . Thus,  $s \leq t$ .

The next four examples are applications of Theorem 8.1.

EXAMPLE 4 Examples of groups of order 100 include  $Z_{100}; Z_{25} \oplus Z_{2} \oplus Z_{2}; Z_{5} \oplus Z_{5} \oplus Z_{4}; Z_{5} \oplus Z_{5} \oplus Z_{2} \oplus Z_{2}; D_{50}; D_{10} \oplus Z_{5}; D_{5} \oplus Z_{10}$ ; and  $D_{5} \oplus D_{5}$ . That these are not isomorphic is an easy consequence of Theorem 8.1.

EXAMPLE 5 Let  $m$  and  $n$  be positive integers that are divisible by 5. We determine the number of elements of order 5 in  $Z_{m} \oplus Z_{n}$ . By Theorem 8.1, we need only count the number of elements  $(a,b)$  in  $Z_{m} \oplus Z_{n}$  with the property that  $5 = |(a,b)| = \operatorname{lcm}(|a|, |b|)$ . Clearly this requires that  $|a| = 1$  or 5 and  $|b| = 1$  or 5, but not  $(a,b) = (0,0)$ . Since both  $Z_{m}$  and  $Z_{n}$  each have a unique subgroup of order 5 there are exactly five choices for  $a$  and 5 choices for  $b$  and therefore 25 choices for  $(a,b)$ , including  $(0,0)$ . So, there are exactly 24 elements in  $Z_{m} \oplus Z_{n}$  of order 5.

The identical argument shows that if  $m$  and  $n$  are positive integers that are divisible by a prime  $p$ , then the number of elements of order  $p$  in  $Z_{m} \oplus Z_{n}$  is  $p^2 - 1$ .

EXAMPLE 6 We determine the number of cyclic subgroups of order 10 in  $Z_{150} \oplus Z_{50}$ . We begin by counting the number of elements of order 10. For  $10 = |(a,b)| = \operatorname{lcm}(|a|, |b|)$  we must restrict  $|a|$  and  $|b|$  to 1, 2, 5, and 10. So, we know that that  $a$  must belong in the unique subgroup  $\langle 15 \rangle$  of order 10 in  $Z_{150}$  and  $b$  must belong in the unique subgroup  $\langle 5 \rangle$  of order 10 in  $Z_{50}$ . Thus, we know  $(a,b) \in \langle 15 \rangle \oplus \langle 5 \rangle$ , which is isomorphic to  $Z_{10} \oplus Z_{10}$ . Since the orders of the elements of  $Z_{10} \oplus Z_{10}$  are 1, 2, 5, and 10, we can determine the number of elements of order 10 by subtracting from 100 the number of elements of orders 1, 2, and 5.

From Example 5 we know that  $Z_{10} \oplus Z_{10}$  has 24 elements of order 5 and 3 elements of order 2. So we get  $100 - 24 - 3 - 1 = 72$  elements of order 10 in  $Z_{150} \oplus Z_{50}$ . Because each cyclic subgroup of order 10 has four elements of order 10 and no two of the cyclic subgroups can have an element of order 10 in common, there must be  $72/4 = 18$  cyclic subgroups of order 10. (This method is analogous to determining the number of sheep in a flock by counting the number of legs and dividing by 4.) Imagine how much work it would be to do this problem without our theorems!

EXAMPLE 7 We determine the number of elements of order 2 in  $D_4 \oplus Z_4$ . For  $|(a, b)| = 2$ , we can have  $|a| = 1$  or 2 and  $|b| = 1$  or 2, but not both with order 1. Counting the identity, there are 6 choices  $a$  and 2 choices for  $b$  for a total of 12 choices for  $(a, b)$ . So, excluding the identity, we have that there are 11 elements of order 2.

The direct product notation is convenient for specifying certain subgroups of a direct product.

EXAMPLE 8 For each divisor  $r$  of  $m$  and  $s$  of  $n$ , the group  $Z_{m} \oplus Z_{n}$  has a subgroup isomorphic to  $Z_{r} \oplus Z_{s}$  (see Exercise 19). To find a subgroup of, say,  $Z_{30} \oplus Z_{12}$  isomorphic to  $Z_{6} \oplus Z_{4}$ , we observe that  $\langle 5 \rangle$  is a subgroup of  $Z_{30}$  of order 6 and  $\langle 3 \rangle$  is a subgroup of  $Z_{12}$  of order 4, so  $\langle 5 \rangle \oplus \langle 3 \rangle$  is the desired subgroup.

The next theorem and its first corollary characterize those direct products of cyclic groups that are themselves cyclic.

# Theorem 8.2 Criterion for  $G\oplus H$  to be Cyclic

Let  $G$  and  $H$  be finite cyclic groups. Then  $G \oplus H$  is cyclic if and only if  $|G|$  and  $|H|$  are relatively prime.

PROOF Let  $|G| = m$  and  $|H| = n$ , so that  $|G \oplus H| = mn$ . To prove the first half of the theorem, we assume  $G \oplus H$  is cyclic and show that  $m$  and  $n$  are relatively prime. Suppose that  $\gcd(m, n) = d$  and  $(g, h)$  is a generator of  $G \oplus H$ . Since  $(g, h)^{mn/d} = ((g^m)^{n/d}, (h^n)^{m/d}) = (e, e)$ , we have  $mn = |(g, h)| \leq mn/d$ . Thus,  $d = 1$ .

To prove the other half of the theorem, let  $G = \langle g \rangle$  and  $H = \langle h \rangle$  and suppose  $\gcd(m, n) = 1$ . Then,  $|(g, h)| = \operatorname{lcm}(m, n) = mn = |G \oplus H|$ , so that  $(g, h)$  is a generator of  $G \oplus H$ .

As a consequence of Theorem 8.2 and an induction argument, we obtain the following extension of Theorem 8.2.

# Corollary 1 Criterion for  $G_{1} \oplus G_{2} \oplus \dots \oplus G_{n}$  to Be Cyclic

An external direct product  $G_1 \oplus G_2 \oplus \dots \oplus G_n$  of a finite number of finite cyclic groups is cyclic if and only if  $|G_i|$  and  $|G_j|$  are relatively prime when  $i \neq j$ .

# Corollary 2 Criterion for  $Z_{n_1n_2\dots n_k}\approx Z_{n_1}\oplus Z_{n_2}\oplus \dots \oplus Z_{n_k}$

Let  $m = n_1n_2 \cdots n_k$ . Then  $Z_m$  is isomorphic to  $Z_{n_1} \oplus Z_{n_2} \oplus \cdots \oplus Z_{n_k}$  if and only if  $n_i$  and  $n_j$  are relatively prime when  $i \neq j$ .

By using the results above in an iterative fashion, one can express the same group (up to isomorphism) in many different forms. For example, we have

$$
Z _ {2} \oplus Z _ {2} \oplus Z _ {3} \oplus Z _ {5} \approx Z _ {2} \oplus Z _ {6} \oplus Z _ {5} \approx Z _ {2} \oplus Z _ {3 0}.
$$

Similarly,

$$
\begin{array}{l} Z _ {2} \oplus Z _ {2} \oplus Z _ {3} \oplus Z _ {5} \approx Z _ {2} \oplus Z _ {6} \oplus Z _ {5} \\ \approx Z _ {2} \oplus Z _ {3} \oplus Z _ {2} \oplus Z _ {5} \approx Z _ {6} \oplus Z _ {1 0}. \\ \end{array}
$$

Thus,  $Z_{2} \oplus Z_{30} \approx Z_{6} \oplus Z_{10}$ . Note, however, that,  $Z_{2} \oplus Z_{30} \not\cong Z_{60}$ .

# The Group of Units Modulo  $n$  as an External Direct Product

The  $U$ -groups provide a convenient way to illustrate the preceding ideas. We first introduce some notation. If  $k > 1$  is proper divisor of a positive integer  $n$ , let

$$
U _ {k} (n) = \{x \in U (n) \mid x \bmod k = 1 \}.
$$

For example,  $U_7(105) = \{1, 8, 22, 29, 43, 64, 71, 92\}$ . It can be readily shown that  $U_k(n)$  is indeed a subgroup of  $U(n)$ . (See Exercise 21 in Chapter 3.)

# Theorem 8.3  $U(n)$  as an External Direct Product

Suppose  $s$  and  $t$  are relatively prime. Then  $U(st)$  is isomorphic to the external direct product of  $U(s)$  and  $U(t)$ . In short,

$$
U (s t) \approx U (s) \oplus U (t).
$$

Moreover,  $U_{s}(st)$  is isomorphic to  $U(t)$  and  $U_{t}(st)$  is isomorphic to  $U(s)$ .

PROOF An isomorphism from  $U(st)$  to  $U(s) \oplus U(t)$  is  $x \to (x \bmod s, x \bmod t)$ ; an isomorphism from  $U_s(st)$  to  $U(t)$  is  $x \to x \bmod t$ ; an isomorphism from  $U_t(st)$  to  $U(s)$  is  $x \to x \bmod s$ . We leave the verification that these mappings are operation-preserving, one-to-one, and onto to the reader. (See Exercises 11, 19, and 21 in Chapter 0.)

As a consequence of Theorem 8.3, we have the following result.

# Corollary

Let  $m = n_{1}n_{2}\dots n_{k}$ , where  $\gcd (n_i,n_j) = 1$  for  $i\neq j$ . Then,

$$
U (m) \approx U (n _ {1}) \oplus U (n _ {2}) \oplus \dots \oplus U (n _ {k}).
$$

To see how these results work, let's apply them to  $U(105)$ . We obtain

$$
U (1 0 5) \approx U (7) \oplus U (1 5),
$$

$$
U (1 0 5) \approx U (2 1) \oplus U (5),
$$

$$
U (1 0 5) \approx U (3) \oplus U (5) \oplus U (7).
$$

Moreover,

$$
U (7) \approx U _ {1 5} (1 0 5) = \{1, 1 6, 3 1, 4 6, 6 1, 7 6 \},
$$

$$
U (1 5) \approx U _ {7} (1 0 5) = \{1, 8, 2 2, 2 9, 4 3, 6 4, 7 1, 9 2 \},
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} U (2 1) \approx U _ {5} (1 0 5) = \{1, 1 1, 1 6, 2 6, 3 1, 4 1, 4 6, 6 1, 7 1, 7 6, 8 6, 1 0 1 \}, \\ U (5) \approx U _ {2 1} (1 0 5) = \{1, 2 2, 4 3, 6 4 \}, \\ U (3) \approx U _ {3 5} (1 0 5) = \{1, 7 1 \}. \\ \end{array}
$$

Since  $|U(20)| = 8$  and  $|U(10) \oplus U(2)| = 4$  we see that the condition that  $\gcd(s, t) = 1$  in Theorem 8.3 is necessary.

Among all groups, surely the cyclic groups  $Z_{n}$  have the simplest structures and, at the same time, are the easiest groups with which to compute. Direct products of groups of the form  $Z_{n}$  are only slightly more complicated in structure and computability. Because of this, algebraists endeavor to describe a finite Abelian group as such a direct product. Indeed, we shall soon see that every finite Abelian group can be so represented. With this goal in mind, let us reexamine the  $U$ -groups. Using the corollary to Theorem 8.3 and the facts, first proved by Carl Gauss in 1801, that

$$
U (2) \approx \{0 \}, \qquad U (4) \approx Z _ {2}, \qquad U \left(2 ^ {n}\right) \approx Z _ {2 ^ {n - 2}} \oplus Z _ {2} \qquad \text {f o r} n \geq 3,
$$

and

$$
U (p ^ {n}) \approx Z _ {p ^ {n} - p ^ {n - 1}} \qquad \text {f o r} p \text {a n o d d p r i m e},
$$

we now can write any  $U$ -group as an external direct product of cyclic groups. For example,

$$
\begin{array}{l} U (1 0 5) = U (3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7) \approx U (3) \oplus U (5) \oplus U (7) \\ \approx Z _ {2} \oplus Z _ {4} \oplus Z _ {6} \\ \end{array}
$$

and

$$
\begin{array}{l} U (1 4 4) = U (1 6) \oplus U (9) \\ \approx Z _ {4} \oplus Z _ {2} \oplus Z _ {6}. \\ \end{array}
$$

What is the advantage of expressing the group  $U(n)$  as an external direct product of groups of the form  $Z_{m}$ ? Well, for one thing, we immediately see that  $|U(105)| = 2 \cdot 4 \cdot 6 = 48$  and that  $U(105)$  and  $U(144)$  are isomorphic. Another is that from Theorem 8.1 we know that the orders of the elements in  $U(105)$  are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12. Moreover, arguing as in Examples 5 and 6, we can determine that  $U(105)$  has exactly 16 elements of order 12, say.

These calculations tell us more. Since  $\operatorname{Aut}(Z_{105})$  is isomorphic to  $U(105)$ , we also know that there are 16 automorphisms of  $Z_{105}$  of order 12. Imagine trying to deduce this information directly from  $U(105)$  or, worse yet, from  $\operatorname{Aut}(Z_{105})!$ . These results beautifully illustrate the advantage of being able to represent a finite Abelian group as a direct product of cyclic groups. They also show the value of our theorems about  $\operatorname{Aut}(Z_n)$  and  $U(n)$ . After all, theorems are laborsaving devices. If you want to convince yourself of this, try to prove directly from the definitions that  $\operatorname{Aut}(Z_{105})$  has exactly 16 elements of order 12.

Here is a fun example that pulls together our results from Chapter 6 and Chapter 8.

EXAMPLE 9 Find  $|(\mathrm{Aut}(\mathrm{Aut}(\mathrm{Aut}(Z_{27}))))|$ . To this end we note that  $\mathrm{Aut}(\mathrm{Aut}(\mathrm{Aut}(Z_{27}))) \approx \mathrm{Aut}(\mathrm{Aut}(U(27))) \approx \mathrm{Aut}(\mathrm{Aut}(Z_{18})) \approx \mathrm{Aut}(U(18)) \approx \mathrm{Aut}(Z_6) \approx U(6) \approx Z_2$ .

Let us now turn to some applications.

# Applications

We conclude this chapter with five applications of the material presented here—three to cryptography, the science of sending and deciphering secret messages, one to genetics, and one to electric circuits.

# Data Security

Because computers are built from two-state electronic components, it is natural to represent information as strings of 0s and 1s called binary strings. A binary string of length  $n$  can naturally be thought of as an element of  $Z_{2} \oplus Z_{2} \oplus \dots \oplus Z_{2}$  ( $n$  copies) where the parentheses and the commas have been deleted. Thus the binary string 11000110 corresponds to the element (1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0) in  $Z_{2} \oplus Z_{2} \oplus Z_{2} \oplus Z_{2} \oplus Z_{2} \oplus Z_{2} \oplus Z_{2}$ . Similarly, two binary strings  $a_{1}a_{2}\dots a_{n}$  and  $b_{1}b_{2}\dots b_{n}$  are added componentwise modulo 2 just as their corresponding elements in  $Z_{2} \oplus Z_{2} \oplus \dots \oplus Z_{2}$  are. For example,

$$
1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 + 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 = 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1
$$

and

$$
1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 + 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 + 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.
$$

The fact that the sum of two binary sequences  $a_1a_2 \cdots a_n + b_1b_2 \cdots b_n = 00 \cdots 0$  if and only if the sequences are identical is the basis for a data security system used to protect Internet transactions.

Suppose that you want to purchase an item from Amazon. Need you be concerned that a hacker will intercept your credit-card number during the transaction? As you might expect, your credit-card number is sent to Amazon in a way that protects the data. We explain one way to send credit-card numbers over the Web securely. When you place an order with Amazon, the company sends your computer a randomly generated string of 0's and 1's called a key. This key has the same length as the binary string corresponding to your credit-card number and the two strings are added (think of this process as "locking" the data). The resulting sum is then transmitted to Amazon. Amazon in turn adds the same key to the received string, which then produces the original string corresponding to your credit-card number (adding the key a second time "unlocks" the data).

To illustrate the idea, say you want to send an eight-digit binary string such as  $s = 10101100$  to Amazon (actual credit-card numbers have very long strings) and Amazon sends your computer the key  $k = 00111101$ . Your computer returns the string  $s + k = 10101100 + 00111101 = 10010001$  to Amazon, and Amazon adds  $k$  to this string to get  $10010001 + 00111101 = 10101100$ , which is the string representing your credit-card number. If

someone intercepts the number  $s + k = 10010001$  during transmission it is no value without knowing  $k$ .

The method is secure because the key sent by Amazon is randomly generated and used only one time.

# Public Key Cryptography

Unlike auctions such as those on eBay, where each bid is known by everyone, a silent auction is one in which each bid is secret. Suppose that you wanted to use your Twitter account to run a silent auction. How could a scheme be devised so that users could post their bids in such a way that the amounts are intelligible only to the account holder? In the mid-1970s, Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman devised an ingenious method that permits each person who is to receive a secret message to tell publicly how to scramble messages sent to him or her. And even though the method used to scramble the message is known publicly, only the person for whom it is intended will be able to unscramble the message. The idea is based on the fact that there exist efficient methods for finding very large prime numbers (say about 100 digits long) and for multiplying large numbers, but no one knows an efficient algorithm for factoring large integers (say about 200 digits long). The person who is to receive the message chooses a pair of large primes  $p$  and  $q$  and chooses an integer  $e$  (called the encryption exponent) with  $1 < e < m$ , where  $m = \operatorname{lcm}(p - 1, q - 1)$ , such that  $e$  is relatively prime to  $m$  (any such  $e$  will do). This person calculates  $n = pq$  ( $n$  is called the key) and announces that a message  $M$  is to be sent to him or her publicly as  $M^e \bmod n$ . Although  $e$ ,  $n$ , and  $M^e$  are available to everyone, only the person who knows how to factor  $n$  as  $pq$  will be able to decipher the message.

To present a simple example that nevertheless illustrates the principal features of the method, say we wish to send the message "YES." We convert the message into a string of digits by replacing A by 01, B by 02, ..., Z by 26, and a blank by 00. So, the message YES becomes 250519. To keep the numbers involved from becoming too unwieldy, we send the message in blocks of four digits and fill in with blanks when needed. Thus, the message YES is represented by the two blocks 2505 and 1900. The person to whom the message is to be sent has picked two primes  $p$  and  $q$ , say  $p = 37$  and  $q = 73$ , and a number  $e$  that has no prime divisors in common with  $\operatorname{lcm}(p - 1, q - 1) = 72$ , say  $e = 5$ , and has published  $n = 37 \cdot 73 = 2701$  and  $e = 5$  in a public forum. We will send the "scrambled" numbers  $(2505)^{5} \mod 2701$  and  $(1900)^{5} \mod 2701$  rather than 2505 and 1900, and the receiver will unscramble them. We show the work involved for us and the receiver only for the block 2505. We determine  $(2505)^{5} \mod 2701 = 2415$  by using a modular arithmetic calculator such as the one at planetcalc.com/8326/.<sup>2</sup>

Thus, the number 2415 is sent to the receiver. Now the receiver must take this number and convert it back to 2505. To do so, the receiver takes the two factors of 2701,  $p = 37$  and  $q = 73$ , and calculates the least common multiple of  $p - 1 = 36$  and  $q - 1 = 72$ , which is 72. (This is where the knowledge of  $p$  and  $q$  is necessary.) Next, the receiver must find  $e^{-1} = d$  (called the decryption exponent) in  $U(72)$ —that is, solve the equation  $5 \cdot d = 1 \mod 72$ . This number is 29. See https://www.dcode.fr/modular-inverse or use a Google search box to compute  $5^k$  for each divisor  $k$  of  $|U(72)| = \phi(9) \cdot \phi(8) = 24$  starting with 2 until we reach  $5^k \mod 72 = 1$ . Doing so, we obtain  $5^6 \mod 72 = 1$ , which implies that  $5^5 \mod 72 = 29$  is  $5^{-1}$  in  $U(72)$ .

Then the receiver takes the number received, 2415, and calculates  $(2415)^{29}$  mod  $2701 = 2505$ , the encoded number. Thus, the receiver correctly determines the code for "YE." On the other hand, without knowing how  $pq$  factors, one cannot find the modulus (in our case, 72) that is needed to determine the decryption exponent  $d$ .

The procedure just described is called the RSA public key encryption scheme in honor of the three people (Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman) who discovered the method. It is widely used in conjunction with web servers and browsers, e-mail programs, remote login sessions, and electronic financial transactions. The algorithm is summarized below.

# Receiver

1. Pick very large primes  $p$  and  $q$  and compute  $n = pq$ .  
2. Compute the least common multiple of  $p - 1$  and  $q - 1$ ; let us call it  $m$ .  
3. Pick  $e$  relatively prime to  $m$ .  
4. Find  $d$  such that  $ed \bmod m = 1$ .  
5. Publicly announce  $n$  and  $e$ .

# Sender

1. Convert the message to a string of digits.  
2. Break up the message into uniform blocks of digits; call them  $M_1, M_2, \ldots, M_k$ . (The integer value of each  $M_i$  must be less than  $n$ . In practice,  $n$  is so large that this is not a concern.)  
3. Check to see that the greatest common divisor of each  $M_i$  and  $n$  is 1. If not,  $n$  can be factored and our code is broken. (In practice, the primes  $p$  and  $q$  are so large that they exceed all  $M_i$ , so this step may be omitted.)  
4. Calculate and send  $R_{i} = M_{i}^{e}$  mod  $n$

# Receiver

1. For each received message  $R_{i}$ , calculate  $R_{i}^{d}$  mod  $n$ .  
2. Convert the string of digits back to a string of characters.

Why does this method work? Well, we know that  $U(n) \approx U(p) \oplus U(q) \approx Z_{p-1} \oplus Z_{q-1}$ . Thus, an element of the form  $x^m$  in  $U(n)$  corresponds under an isomorphism to one of the form  $(mx_1, mx_2)$  in  $Z_{p-1} \oplus Z_{q-1}$ . Since  $m$  is the least common multiple of  $p-1$  and  $q-1$ , we may write  $m = s(p-1)$  and

$m = t(q - 1)$  for some integers  $s$  and  $t$ . Then  $(mx_{1}, mx_{2}) = (s(p - 1)x_{1}, (q - 1)x_{2}) = (0, 0)$  in  $Z_{p - 1} \oplus Z_{q - 1}$ , and it follows that  $x^{m} = 1$  for all  $x$  in  $U(n)$ . So, because each message  $M_{i}$  is an element of  $U(n)$  and  $e$  was chosen so that  $ed = 1 + km$  for some  $k$ , we have, modulo  $n$ ,

$$
R _ {i} ^ {d} = \left(M _ {i} ^ {e}\right) ^ {d} = M _ {i} ^ {e d} = M _ {i} ^ {1 + k m} = M _ {i} \left(M _ {i} ^ {m}\right) ^ {k} = M _ {i} 1 ^ {k} = M _ {i}.
$$

In 2002, Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman received the Association for Computing Machinery A. M. Turing Award, which is considered the "Nobel Prize of computing," for their contribution to public key cryptography.

# Digital Signatures

With so many financial transactions now taking place electronically, the problem of authenticity is paramount. How is a stockbroker to know that an electronic message she receives that tells her to sell one stock and buy another actually came from her client? The technique used in public key cryptography allows for digital signatures as well. Let us say that person  $A$  wants to send a secret message to person  $B$  in such a way that only  $B$  can decode the message and  $B$  will know that only  $A$  could have sent it. Abstractly, let  $E_{A}$  and  $D_{A}$  denote the algorithms that  $A$  uses for encryption and decryption, respectively, and let  $E_{B}$  and  $D_{B}$  denote the algorithms that  $B$  uses for encryption and decryption, respectively. Here we assume that  $E_{A}$  and  $E_{B}$  are available to the public, whereas  $D_{A}$  is known only to  $A$  and  $D_{B}$  is known only to  $B$ , and that  $D_{B}E_{B}$  and  $E_{A}D_{A}$  applied to any message leaves the message unchanged. Then  $A$  sends a message  $M$  to  $B$  as  $E_{B}(D_{A}(M))$  and  $B$  decodes the received message by applying the function  $E_{A}D_{B}$  to it to obtain

$$
(E _ {A} D _ {B}) (E _ {B} (D _ {A} (M)) = E _ {A} (D _ {B} E _ {B}) (D _ {A} (M)) = E _ {A} (D _ {A} (M)) = M.
$$

Notice that only  $A$  can execute the first step (i.e., create  $D_A(M)$  and only  $B$  can implement the last step (i.e., apply  $E_{A}D_{B}$  to the received message).

Transactions using digital signatures became legally binding in the United States in October 2000.

# Genetics<sup>3</sup>

The genetic code can be conveniently modeled using elements of  $Z_{4} \oplus Z_{4} \oplus \dots \oplus Z_{4}$ , where we omit the parentheses and the commas and just use strings of 0's, 1's, 2's, and 3's and add componentwise modulo 4. A DNA molecule is composed of two long strands in the form of a double helix. Each strand is made up of strings of the four nitrogen bases adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C). Each base on one strand binds to a complementary base on the other strand. Adenine is always bound to thymine, and guanine is always bound to cytosine. To model this process, we identify A with 0, T with 2, G with 1, and C with 3. Thus, the DNA segment ACGTAACAGGA

and its complement segment TGCATTGTCCT are denoted by 03120030110 and 21302212332. Noting that in  $Z_{4}, 0 + 2 = 2, 2 + 2 = 0, 1 + 2 = 3$ , and  $3 + 2 = 1$ , we see that adding 2 to elements of  $Z_{4}$  interchanges 0 and 2 and 1 and 3. So, for any DNA segment  $a_{1}a_{2}\dots a_{n}$  represented by elements of  $Z_{4} \oplus Z_{4} \oplus \dots \oplus Z_{4}$ , we see that its complementary segment is represented by  $a_{1}a_{2}\dots a_{n} + 22\ldots 2$ .

# Electric Circuits

Many homes have light fixtures that are operated by a pair of switches. They are wired so that when either switch is thrown, the light changes its status (from on to off or vice versa). Suppose the wiring is done so that the light is on when both switches are in the up position. We can conveniently think of the states of the two switches as being matched with the elements of  $Z_{2} \oplus Z_{2}$ , with the two switches in the up position corresponding to  $(0, 0)$  and the two switches in the down position corresponding to  $(1, 1)$ . Each time a switch is thrown, we add 1 to the corresponding component in the group  $Z_{2} \oplus Z_{2}$ . We then see that the lights are on when the switches correspond to the elements of the subgroup  $\langle (1, 1) \rangle$  and are off when the switches correspond to the elements in the coset  $(1, 0) + \langle (1, 1) \rangle$ . A similar analysis applies in the case of three switches, with the subgroup  $\{(0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 0), (0, 1, 1), (1, 0, 1)\}$  corresponding to the lights-on situation.

In this chapter we have shown how new groups can be readily created from existing ones and how we can analyze the groups of the form  $U(n)$  by expressing them as a product of smaller, easier to understand pieces. In the next chapter, we will extend the latter idea to other groups.

LEONARD ADLEMAN was born on December 31, 1945 in San Francisco, California. He received a B.A. degree in mathematics in 1968 and a Ph.D. degree in computer science in 1976 from the University of California, Berkeley. He spent 1976-1980 as professor of mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he met Ronald Rivest and Adi Shamir. Rivest and Shamir were attempting to devise a secure public key cryptosystem and asked Adleman if he could break their codes. Eventually, they invented what is now known as the RSA code that was simple to implement yet secure. In 1983, Adleman, Shamir, and Rivest formed the RSA Data Security company to license their algorithm. Their algorithm has become the primary cryptosystem used for security on the World Wide Web. They sold their company for $200 million in 1996.

In the early 1990s, Adleman became interested in trying to find out a way to use

DNA as a computer. His pioneering work on this problem lead to the field now called "DNA computing."

Among his many honors are: the Association for Computing Machinery A. M. Turing Award, the Kanallakis Award for Theory and Practice, and election to the National Academy of Engineering, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the National Academy of Sciences.

Adleman's current position is the Henry Salvatori Distinguished Chair in Computer Science and Professor of Computer Science and Biological Sciences at the University of Southern California, where he has been since 1980.

# Normal Subgroups and Factor Groups

It is tribute to the genius of Galois that he recognized that those subgroups for which the left and right cosets coincide are distinguished ones. Very often in mathematics the crucial problem is to recognize and to discover what are the relevant concepts; once this is accomplished the job may be more than half done.

[On the concept of 'group':] ... what a wealth, what a grandeur of thought may spring from what slight beginnings.

H. F. Baker

# Normal Subgroups

As we saw in Chapter 7, if  $G$  is a group and  $H$  is a subgroup of  $G$ , it is not always true that  $aH = Ha$  for all  $a$  in  $G$ . There are certain situations where this does hold, however, and these cases turn out to be of critical importance in the theory of groups. It was Galois, about 190 years ago, who first recognized that such subgroups were worthy of special attention.

# Definition Normal Subgroup

A subgroup  $H$  of a group  $G$  is called a normal subgroup of  $G$  if  $aH = Ha$  for all  $a$  in  $G$ . We denote this by  $H \triangleleft G$ .

You should think of a normal subgroup in this way: You can switch the order of a product of an element  $a$  from the group and an element  $h$  from the normal subgroup  $H$ , but you must "fudge" a bit on the element from the normal subgroup  $H$  by using some  $h'$  from  $H$  rather than  $h$ . That is, there is an element  $h'$  in  $H$  such that  $ah = h'a$ . Likewise, there is some  $h''$  in  $H$  such that  $ha = ah''$ . (It is possible that  $h' = h$  or  $h'' = h$ , but we may not assume this.)

To illustrate the importance of normality consider a situation where we have a group  $G$  generated by two elements  $a$  and  $b$  where  $|a| = 3$  and  $|b| = 2$  (one such example of this is  $D_{3}$ ). If  $a$  and  $b$  commute then, because the set  $\{e, a, a^{2}, b, ab, ab^{2}\}$  is closed, it is  $G$  itself. If not, then all we know about  $G$  is that the non-identity elements can be written as products of  $a$ 's and  $b$ 's with never more than two consecutive  $a$ 's and never with two consecutive  $b$ 's. That is,  $e, a, b, a^{2}, ab, ba, a^{2}b, aba, ba^{2}, bab, a^{2}ba, aba^{2}, abab, ba^{2}b, baba, \ldots$ . Some of these may be equal but we do not know which. The group may be finite

or infinite but we do not know which. In sharp contrast, if  $H = \{e, a, a^2\}$  or  $K = \{e, b\}$  is normal in  $G$ , then  $G = \{e, a, a^2, b, ab, a^2b\} = HK$  (see Example 5). So, in this situation, and many others, normality is as good as commutativity.

There are several equivalent formulations of the definition of normality. We have chosen the one that is the easiest to use in applications. However, to verify that a subgroup is normal, it is usually better to use Theorem 9.1, which is a weaker version of property 8 of the lemma in Chapter 7. It allows us to substitute a condition about two subgroups of  $G$  for a condition about two cosets of  $G$ .

# Theorem 9.1 Normal Subgroup Test

A subgroup  $H$  of  $G$  is normal in  $G$  if and only if  $xHx^{-1} \subseteq H$  for all  $x$  in  $G$ .

PROOF If  $H$  is normal in  $G$ , then for any  $x \in G$  and  $h \in H$  there is an  $h'$  in  $H$  such that  $xh = h'x$ . Thus,  $xhx^{-1} = h'$ , and therefore  $xHx^{-1} \subseteq H$ .

Conversely, if  $xHx^{-1} \subseteq H$  for all  $x$ , then, letting  $x = a$ , we have  $aHa^{-1} \subseteq H$  or  $aH \subseteq Ha$ . On the other hand, letting  $x = a^{-1}$ , we have  $a^{-1}H(a^{-1})^{-1} = a^{-1}Ha \subseteq H$  or  $Ha \subseteq aH$ .

EXAMPLE 1 Every subgroup of an Abelian group is normal. (In this case,  $ah = ha$  for  $a$  in the group and  $h$  in the subgroup.)

EXAMPLE 2 The center  $Z(G)$  of a group is always normal. [Again,  $ah = ha$  for any  $a \in G$  and any  $h \in Z(G)$ .]

EXAMPLE 3 The alternating group  $A_{n}$  of even permutations is a normal subgroup of  $S_{n}$ . [Note, for example, that for (12) ∈  $S_{n}$  and (123) ∈  $A_{n}$ , we have (12)(123) ≠ (123)(12) but (12)(123) = (132)(12) and (132) ∈  $A_{n}$ .] See Exercise 9.

EXAMPLE 4 Every subgroup of  $D_{n}$  consisting solely of rotations is normal in  $D_{n}$ . (For any rotation  $R$  and any reflection  $F$ , we have  $FR = R^{-1}F$  and any two rotations commute.)

The next example illustrates a way to use a normal subgroup to create new subgroups from existing ones.

EXAMPLE 5 Let  $H$  be a normal subgroup of a group  $G$  and  $K$  be any subgroup of  $G$ . Then  $HK = \{hk \mid h \in H, k \in K\}$  is a subgroup of  $G$ . To verify this, note that  $e = ee$  is in  $HK$ . Then for any  $a = h_1k_1$  and  $b = h_2k_2$ , where  $h_1, h_2$  are in  $H$  and  $k_1, k_2$  are in  $K$ , there is an element  $h'$  in  $H$  such that  $ab^{-1} = h_1k_1k_2^{-1}h_2^{-1} = h_1(k_1k_2^{-1})h_2^{-1} = (h_1h')(k_1k_2^{-1})$ . So,  $ab^{-1}$  is in  $HK$ .

Be careful not to assume that for any subgroups  $H$  and  $K$  of a group  $G$ , the set  $HK$  is a subgroup of  $G$ . See Exercise 6 in Chapter 7.

Combining Examples 4 and 5, we have the following appealing classification of all subgroups of order  $n$  is  $D_{n}$ .

# EXAMPLE 6

If  $n > 3$  is even, the set of  $n$  rotations in  $D_{n}$  is a subgroup of order  $n$ . For the subgroups of  $D_{n}$  of order  $n$  that contain reflections, let  $R = R_{360/n}$  and  $F$  be any reflection in  $D_{n}$ . Then for  $H = \{R_{0}, R^{2}, \ldots, R^{n-2}\}$  and  $K = \{R_{0}, F\}$ ,  $HK$  is a subgroup of  $D_{n}$  of order  $n$ . Since  $HK$  contains only half of the reflections in  $D_{n}$ , we can obtain a third subgroup of order  $n$  by replacing  $F$  in  $H$  by any reflection  $F'$  not in  $HK$ . To see that these three subgroups are the only ones, note that any other subgroup  $L$  in  $D_{n}$  ( $n > 3$ ) of order  $n$  must have the same  $n/2$  rotations that are in  $H$  and  $n/2$  reflections. But, because every reflection in  $D_{n}$  was used in one of the two subgroups described above,  $F$  would be contained in one of the two. Note that  $HK$  is isomorphic to  $D_{n/2}$ .

For odd  $n > 3$ , the set of  $n$  rotations is the only subgroup of  $D_{n}$  order  $n$ . For if a subgroup  $L$  contained a reflection  $F$ , let  $A$  be the set of rotations in  $L$  and  $B$  be the set of reflections in  $L$ . Then the mapping  $x \to xF$  from  $A$  to  $B$  is one-to-one and onto. Thus,  $A$  and  $B$  have the same number of elements. But that implies  $n$  is even.

EXAMPLE 7 If a group  $G$  has a unique subgroup  $H$  of some finite order, then  $H$  is normal in  $G$ . To see that this is so, observe that for any  $g \in G$ , the inner automorphism  $\phi_g$  takes  $H$  to  $gHg^{-1}$  so  $gHg^{-1}$  is a subgroup of  $G$  and  $|gHg^{-1}| = |H|$ .

EXAMPLE 8 The group  $SL(2,\mathbf{R})$  of  $2 \times 2$  matrices with determinant 1 is a normal subgroup of  $GL(2,\mathbf{R})$ , the group of  $2 \times 2$  matrices with nonzero determinant. To verify this, we use the Normal Subgroup Test given in Theorem 9.1. Let  $x \in GL(2,\mathbf{R}) = G$ ,  $h \in SL(2,\mathbf{R}) = H$ , and note that  $\det xhx^{-1} = (\det x)(\det h)(\det x)^{-1} = (\det x)(\det x)^{-1} = 1$ . So,  $xhx^{-1} \in H$ , and, therefore,  $xHx^{-1} \subseteq H$ .

EXAMPLE 9 Referring to the group table for  $A_4$  given in Table 5.1, we may observe that  $H = \{\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4\}$  is a normal subgroup of  $A_4$ . To see why, simply note that for any  $\beta$  in  $A_4$ ,  $\beta H\beta^{-1}$  is a subgroup of order 4 and  $H$  is the only subgroup of  $A_4$  of order 4 (see Table 5.1). Thus,  $\beta H\beta^{-1} = H$ . In contrast, none of the four subgroups of order 3 is normal. For if  $K$  is a normal subgroup of  $A_4$  of order 3 then, by the  $|HK|$ -Theorem (7.2), we have that  $A_4 = HK$ , where  $H$  and  $K$  are normal and  $H \cap K = \{\epsilon\}$ . But, because  $H$  and  $K$  are Abelian so too  $A_4 = H \times K \approx H \oplus K$  would be Abelian, which is false.

# Factor Groups

We have yet to explain why normal subgroups are of special significance. The reason is simple. When the subgroup  $H$  of  $G$  is normal, then the set of left (or right) cosets of  $H$  in  $G$  is itself a group—called the factor group of  $G$  by  $H$  (or the quotient group of  $G$  by  $H$ ). Quite often, one can obtain information about a group by studying its factor groups. Indeed, as we will see in this and future chapters, normal subgroups have super powers. Theorem 9.3 is the first demonstration of these powers.

# Theorem 9.2 Factor Groups (O. Hölder, 1889)

Let  $G$  be a group and let  $H$  be a normal subgroup of  $G$ . The set  $G / H = \{aH \mid a \in G\}$  is a group under the operation  $(aH)(bH) = abH$ .<sup>1</sup>

PROOF Our first task is to show that the operation is well-defined; that is, we must show that the correspondence defined above from  $G / H \times G / H$  into  $G / H$  is actually a function. To do this, we assume that for some elements  $a, a', b$ , and  $b'$  from  $G$ , we have  $aH = a'H$  and  $bH = b'H$ , and verify that  $aHbH = a'Hb'H$ . That is, verify that  $abH = a'b'H$ . (This shows that the definition of multiplication depends on only the cosets and not on the coset representatives.) From  $aH = a'H$  and  $bH = b'H$ , we have  $a' = ah_1$  and  $b' = bh_2$  for some  $h_1, h_2$  in  $H$ , and therefore  $a'b'H = ah_1bh_2H = ah_1bH = ah_1Hb = aHb = abH$ . Here we have made multiple use of associativity, property 2 of the lemma in Chapter 7, and the fact that  $H \triangleleft G$ . The rest is easy:  $eH = H$  is the identity;  $a^{-1}H$  is the inverse of  $aH$ ; and  $(aHbH)cH = (ab)HcH = (ab)cH = a(bc)H = aH(bc)H = aH(bHcH)$ . This proves that  $G / H$  is a group.

Notice that the normality of  $H$  in  $G$  assures that the product of two left cosets  $aH$  and  $bH$  is a left coset of  $H$  is  $G$ , and since  $aHbH$  contains  $ab$ , the product is  $abH$ .

Although it is merely a curiosity, we point out that the converse of Theorem 9.2 is also true; that is, if the correspondence  $aHbH = abH$  defines a group operation on the set of left cosets of  $H$  in  $G$ , then  $H$  is normal in  $G$ . See Exercises 39 and 40.

The next few examples illustrate the factor group concept.

EXAMPLE 10 Let  $4Z = \{0, \pm 4, \pm 8, \ldots\}$ . To construct  $Z / 4Z$ , we first must determine the left cosets of  $4Z$  in  $Z$ . Consider the following four cosets:

$$
0 + 4 Z = 4 Z = \{0, \pm 4, \pm 8, \dots \},
$$

$$
1 + 4 Z = \{1, 5, 9, \dots ; - 3, - 7, - 1 1, \dots \},
$$

$$
2 + 4 Z = \{2, 6, 1 0, \dots ; - 2, - 6, - 1 0, \dots \},
$$

$$
3 + 4 Z = \{3, 7, 1 1, \dots ; - 1, - 5, - 9, \dots \}.
$$

We claim that there are no others. For if  $k \in Z$ , then  $k = 4q + r$ , where  $0 \leq r < 4$ ; and, therefore,  $k + 4Z = r + 4q + 4Z = r + 4Z$ . Now that we know the elements of the factor group, our next job is to determine the structure of  $Z / 4Z$ . Cayley table is

<table><tr><td></td><td>0 + 4Z</td><td>1 + 4Z</td><td>2 + 4Z</td><td>3 + 4Z</td></tr><tr><td>0 + 4Z</td><td>0 + 4Z</td><td>1 + 4Z</td><td>2 + 4Z</td><td>3 + 4Z</td></tr><tr><td>1 + 4Z</td><td>1 + 4Z</td><td>2 + 4Z</td><td>3 + 4Z</td><td>0 + 4Z</td></tr><tr><td>2 + 4Z</td><td>2 + 4Z</td><td>3 + 4Z</td><td>0 + 4Z</td><td>1 + 4Z</td></tr><tr><td>3 + 4Z</td><td>3 + 4Z</td><td>0 + 4Z</td><td>1 + 4Z</td><td>2 + 4Z</td></tr></table>

Clearly, then,  $Z / 4Z$  isomorphic to  $Z_4$ . More generally, if for any  $n > 0$  we let  $nZ = \{0, \pm n, \pm 2n, \pm 3n, \ldots\}$ , then  $Z / nZ$  is isomorphic to  $Z_n$ .

EXAMPLE 11 Let  $G = Z_{18}$  and let  $H = \langle 6 \rangle = \{0, 6, 12\}$ . Then  $G / H = \{0 + H, 1 + H, 2 + H, 3 + H, 4 + H, 5 + H\}$ . To illustrate how the group elements are combined, consider  $(5 + H) + (4 + H)$ . This should be one of the six elements listed in the set  $G / H$ . Well,  $(5 + H) + (4 + H) = 5 + 4 + H = 9 + H = 3 + 6 + H = 3 + H$ , since  $H$  absorbs all multiples of 6.

A few words of caution about notation are warranted here. When  $H$  is a normal subgroup of  $G$ , the expression  $|aH|$  has two possible interpretations. One could be thinking of  $aH$  as a set of elements and  $|aH|$  as the size of the set; or, as is more often the case, one could be thinking of  $aH$  as a group element of the factor group  $G / H$  and  $|aH|$  as the order of the element  $aH$  in  $G / H$ . In Example 11, for instance, the set  $3 + H$  has size 3, since  $3 + H = \{3, 9, 15\}$ . But the group element  $3 + H$  has order 2, since  $(3 + H) + (3 + H) = 6 + H = 0 + H$ . As is usually the case when one notation has more than one meaning, the appropriate interpretation will be clear from the context.

EXAMPLE 12 Let  $\mathcal{K} = \{R_0, R_{180}\}$ , and consider the factor group of the dihedral group  $D_4$  (see the back inside cover for the multiplication table for  $D_4$ )

$$
D _ {4} / \mathcal {K} = \{\mathcal {K}, R _ {9 0} \mathcal {K}, H \mathcal {K}, D \mathcal {K} \}.
$$

The multiplication table for  $D_4 / \mathcal{K}$  is given in Table 9.1. (Notice that even though  $R_{90}H = D'$ , we have used  $D\mathcal{K}$  in Table 9.1 for  $R_{90}\mathcal{KH}\mathcal{K}$  because  $D'\mathcal{K} = D\mathcal{K}$ .)

Table 9.1  

<table><tr><td></td><td>K</td><td>R90K</td><td>HK</td><td>DK</td></tr><tr><td>K</td><td>K</td><td>R90K</td><td>HK</td><td>DK</td></tr><tr><td>R90K</td><td>R90K</td><td>K</td><td>DK</td><td>HK</td></tr><tr><td>HK</td><td>HK</td><td>DK</td><td>K</td><td>R90K</td></tr><tr><td>DK</td><td>DK</td><td>HK</td><td>R90K</td><td>K</td></tr></table>

$D_{4} / \mathcal{K}$  provides a good opportunity to demonstrate how a factor group of  $G$  is related to  $G$  itself. Suppose we arrange the heading of the Cayley table for  $D_{4}$  in such a way that elements from the same coset of  $\mathcal{K}$  are in adjacent columns (Table 9.2). Then, the multiplication table for  $D_{4}$  can be blocked off into boxes that are cosets of  $\mathcal{K}$ , and the substitution that replaces a box containing the element  $x$  with the coset  $x\mathcal{K}$  yields the Cayley table for  $D_{4} / \mathcal{K}$ .

For example, when we pass from  $D_4$  to  $D_4 / \mathcal{K}$ , the box

![](images/3c83514030f6a70488c6803cdfbb0616934b715a58a606eedb76b25d465a9fe0.jpg)

in Table 9.2 becomes the element  $H\mathcal{K}$  in Table 9.1. Similarly, the box

![](images/642fd124b5452fa54ef6edea26632349d513b9500d7f5b1fedc5b2d5d3749564.jpg)

becomes the element  $D\mathcal{K}$ , and so on.

Table 9.2

In this way, one can see that the formation of a factor group  $G / H$  causes a systematic collapse of the elements of  $G$ . In particular, all the elements in the coset of  $H$  containing  $a$  collapse to the single group element  $aH$  in  $G / H$ .

In Chapter 11, we will prove that every finite Abelian group is isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups. In particular, an Abelian group of order 8 is isomorphic to one of  $Z_{8}$ ,  $Z_{4} \oplus Z_{2}$ , or  $Z_{2} \oplus Z_{2} \oplus Z_{2}$ . In the next two examples, we examine Abelian factor groups of order 8 and determine the isomorphism type of each.

EXAMPLE 13 Let  $G = U(32) = \{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31\}$  and  $H = U_{16}(32) = \{1, 17\}$ . Then  $G / H$  is an Abelian group of order  $16 / 2 = 8$ . Which of the three Abelian groups of order 8 is it— $Z_8, Z_4 \oplus Z_2$ , or  $Z_2 \oplus Z_2 \oplus Z_2$ ? To answer this question, we need only determine the elements of  $G / H$  and their orders. Observe that the eight cosets

$$
1 H = \{1, 1 7 \}, \quad 3 H = \{3, 1 9 \}, \quad 5 H = \{5, 2 1 \}, \quad 7 H = \{7, 2 3 \},
$$

$$
9 H = \{9, 2 5 \}, \quad 1 1 H = \{1 1, 2 7 \}, \quad 1 3 H = \{1 3, 2 9 \}, \quad 1 5 H = \{1 5, 3 1 \}
$$

are all distinct, so that they form the factor group  $G / H$ . Clearly,  $(3H)^2 = 9H \neq H$ , and so  $3H$  has order at least 4. Thus,  $G / H$  is not  $Z_2 \oplus Z_2 \oplus Z_2$ . On the other hand,  $(7H)^2 = 49H = 17H = H$  and  $(9H)^2 = 81H = 17H = H$  show that  $7H$  and  $9H$  are distinct elements of order 2. So  $G / H$  cannot be isomorphic to  $Z_8$  either, since a cyclic group of even order has exactly one

element of order 2 (Theorem 4.4). This proves that  $U(32) / U_{16}(32) \approx Z_4 \oplus Z_2$ , which (not so incidentally!) is isomorphic to  $U(16)$ .

EXAMPLE 14 Let  $G = Z_8 \oplus Z_4$  and let  $H = \langle (2,2) \rangle$  of  $G$ . Given that  $G / H$  is isomorphic to one of  $Z_8, Z_4 \oplus Z_2, Z_2 \oplus Z_2 \oplus Z_2$ , we can determine which one by elimination. First note that  $H = \{(0,0), (2,2), (4,0), (6,2)\}$ . Thus for any  $(a,b) + H$  we have  $((a,b) + H)^4 = (4a,4b) + H) = (4,0) + H$  if  $a$  is odd and  $(0,0) + H$  if  $a$  is even. Since  $H$  contains both  $(0,0)$  and  $(4,0)$  we have that  $((a,b) + H)^4 = (4a,4b) + H) = H$ . Thus the maximum order of any element in  $G / H$  is 4. Since  $((1,0) + H)^2 = (2,0) + H \neq H$  we know that  $|(1,0) + H| = 4$ . Thus we have eliminated both  $Z_8$  and  $Z_2 \oplus Z_2 \oplus Z_2$ .

It is crucial to understand that when we factor out by a normal subgroup  $H$ , what we are essentially doing is defining every element in  $H$  to be the identity. Thus, in Example 12, we are making  $R_{180}\mathcal{K} = \mathcal{K}$  the identity. Likewise,  $R_{270}\mathcal{K} = R_{90}R_{180}\mathcal{K} = R_{90}\mathcal{K}$ . Similarly, in Example 10, we are declaring any multiple of 4 to be 0 in the factor group  $Z / 4Z$ . This is why  $5 + 4Z = 1 + 4 + 4Z = 1 + 4Z$ , and so on. In Example 13, we have  $3H = 19H$  since  $19 = 3\cdot 17$  in  $U(32)$  and going to the factor group makes 17 the identity. Algebraists often refer to the process of creating the factor group  $G / H$  as "killing"  $H$ .

# Applications of Factor Groups

The next three theorems illustrate how knowledge of a factor group of  $G$  reveals information about  $G$  itself.

A natural consequence of the fact that the operation for a factor group  $G / H$  is inherited from the operation in  $G$  is that many properties of  $G$  are inherited by  $G / H$  and many properties of  $G$  can be deduced from properties of  $G / H$ . The importance of factor groups is that the structure of  $G / H$  is usually less complicated than that of  $G$  and yet  $G / H$  simulates  $G$  in many ways. Indeed, we may think of  $G / H$  as a less complicated approximation of  $G$  (similar to using the rational number 3.14 as an approximation of the irrational number  $\pi$ ). A number of the relationships between a group and its factor groups are given in the exercises.

# Theorem 9.3  $G / Z$  Theorem

Let  $G$  be a group and let  $Z(G)$  be the center of  $G$ . If  $G / Z(G)$  is cyclic, then  $G$  is Abelian.

PROOF Since  $G$  is Abelian, it suffices to show that the only element of  $Z(G) = G$ , it suffices to show that the identity coset  $Z(G)$ . To this end, let  $G / Z(G) = \langle gZ(G) \rangle$  and let  $a \in G$ . Then there exists an integer  $i$  such that  $aZ(G) = (gZ(G))^i = g^i Z(G)$ . Thus,  $a = g^i z$  for some  $z$  in  $Z(G)$ . Since both  $g^i$  and  $z$  belong to  $C(g)$ , so does  $a$ . Because  $a$  is an arbitrary element of  $G$

this means that every element of  $G$  commutes with  $g$  so  $g \in Z(G)$ . Thus,  $gZ(G) = Z(G)$  is the only element of  $G / Z(G)$ .

A few remarks about Theorem 9.3 are in order. First, our proof shows that a better result is possible: If  $G / H$  is cyclic, where  $H$  is a subgroup of  $Z(G)$ , then  $G$  is Abelian. Second, in practice, it is the contrapositive of the theorem that is most often used—that is, if  $G$  is non-Abelian, then  $G / Z(G)$  is not cyclic. For example, it follows immediately from this statement and Lagrange's Theorem that a non-Abelian group of order  $pq$ , where  $p$  and  $q$  are primes, must have a trivial center. Third, if  $G / Z(G)$  is cyclic, it must be trivial.

The next two examples demonstrate how information about a factor group  $G / H$  can be pulled back to gain information about  $G$ .

EXAMPLE 15 Let  $H$  be a normal subgroup of a group  $G$  and  $\overline{K} = \{H, a_1H, a_2H, a_3H\}$  be a subgroup of the factor group  $G / H$ . Then the set  $K = H \cup a_1H \cup a_2H \cup a_3H$  (called the "pull back" of  $\overline{K}$  to  $G$ ) is a subgroup of  $G$  of order  $4|H|$ . To see this let  $a_0 = e$  and  $a_i, a_j \in \{a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3\}$ . Then for any  $a_i h_i, a_j h_j \in K$  we have  $(a_i h_i)(a_j h_j) \in a_i Ha_j H = a_k H$  for some  $k = 0, 1, 2, 3$  so  $(a_i h_i)(a_j h_j)$  is in  $K$ .

A similar argument applies to all factor groups by taking the  $K$  to be the union of all left cosets of  $H$  in  $G$ .

EXAMPLE 16 Suppose that  $G$  is a finite group and a factor group  $G / H$  has an element  $aH$  of order  $n$ . We show that  $G$  has an element of order  $n$ . Let  $|a| = k$ . Then in the group  $G / H$  we have  $(aH)^k = a^k H = H$  and, by Corollary 3 of Theorem 4.1, we have that  $k$  is a multiple of  $n$ . Writing  $k = mn$  we see that  $(a^m)^n = a^k = e$  and  $n$  is the smallest such positive integer.

# Theorem 9.4  $G / Z(G)\approx \mathrm{Inn}(G)$

# For any group  $G, G / Z(G)$  is isomorphic to  $\operatorname{Inn}(G)$ .

PROOF Consider the correspondence from  $G / Z(G)$  to  $\operatorname{Inn}(G)$  given by  $T: gZ(G) \to \phi_g$  [where, recall,  $\phi_g(x) = gxg^{-1}$  for all  $x$  in  $G$ ]. First, we show that  $T$  is well-defined. To do this, we assume that  $gZ(G) = hZ(G)$  and verify that  $\phi_g = \phi_h$ . (This shows that the image of a coset of  $Z(G)$  depends only on the coset itself and not on the element representing the coset.) From  $gZ(G) = hZ(G)$ , we have that  $h^{-1}g$  belongs to  $Z(G)$ . Then, for all  $x$  in  $G$ ,  $h^{-1}gx = xh^{-1}g$ . Thus,  $gxg^{-1} = hxh^{-1}$  for all  $x$  in  $G$ , and, therefore,  $\phi_g = \phi_h$ . Reversing this argument shows that  $T$  is one-to-one, as well. Clearly,  $T$  is onto.

That  $T$  is operation-preserving follows directly from the fact that  $\phi_g \phi_h = \phi_{gh}$  for all  $g$  and  $h$  in  $G$ .

As an application of Theorems 9.3 and 9.4, we may easily determine  $\operatorname{Inn}(D_6)$  without looking at  $\operatorname{Inn}(D_6)$ !

EXAMPLE 17 We know from Example 15 in Chapter 3 that  $|Z(D_6)| = 2$ .

Thus,  $|D_6 / Z(D_6)| = 6$ . So, by our classification of groups of order 6 (Theorem 7.3), we know that  $\operatorname{Inn}(D_6)$  is isomorphic to  $D_3$  or  $Z_6$ . Now, if  $\operatorname{Inn}(D_6)$  were cyclic, then, by Theorem 9.4,  $D_6 / Z(D_6)$  would be also. But then, Theorem 9.3 would tell us that  $D_6$  is Abelian. So,  $\operatorname{Inn}(D_6)$  is isomorphic to  $D_3$ .

The next theorem demonstrates one of the most powerful proof techniques available in the theory of finite groups—the combined use of factor groups and induction.

# Theorem 9.5 Cauchy's Theorem for Abelian Groups

Let  $G$  be a finite Abelian group and let  $p$  be a prime that divides the order of  $G$ . Then  $G$  has an element of order  $p$ .

PROOF Clearly, this statement is true for the case in which  $G$  has order 2. We prove the theorem by using the Second Principle of Mathematical Induction on  $|G|$ . That is, we assume that the statement is true for all Abelian groups with fewer elements than  $G$  and use this assumption to show that the statement is true for  $G$  as well. Certainly,  $G$  has elements of prime order, for if  $|x| = m$  and  $m = qn$ , where  $q$  is prime, then  $|x^n| = q$ . So let  $x$  be an element of  $G$  of some prime order  $q$ , say. If  $q = p$ , we are finished; so assume that  $q \neq p$ . Since every subgroup of an Abelian group is normal, we may construct the factor group  $\overline{G} = G / \langle x \rangle$ . Then  $\overline{G}$  is Abelian and  $p$  divides  $|\overline{G}|$ , since  $|\overline{G}| = |G| / q$ . By induction, then,  $\overline{G}$  has an element of order  $p$ , and by Example 16, so does  $G$ .

# Internal Direct Products

As we have seen, the external direct product provides a method of putting groups together to get a larger group in such a way that we can determine many properties of the larger group from the properties of the component pieces. For example: If  $G = H \oplus K$ , then  $|G| = |H||K|$ ; every element can be written uniquely in the form  $(h, k)$  when  $h \in H$  and  $k \in K$ ;  $(h_1, k_1)(h_2, k_2) = (h_1h_2, k_1k_2)$ ;  $(h, k)^{-1} = (h^{-1}, k^{-1})$ ; if  $|h|$  and  $|k|$  are finite, then  $|(h, k)| = \operatorname{lcm}(|h|, |k|)$ ; if  $H$  and  $K$  are Abelian, then  $G$  is Abelian; if  $H$  and  $K$  are cyclic and  $|H|$  and  $|K|$  are relatively prime, then  $H \oplus K$  is cyclic. It would be quite useful to be able to reverse this process—that is, to be able to start with a large group  $G$  and break it down into a product of subgroups  $H$  and  $K$  in such a way that these same properties hold without the bother of the parentheses and commas. That is, if  $G = HK$ , then  $|G| = |H||K|$ ; every element of  $G$  is uniquely written in the form  $hk$  where  $h \in H$  and  $k \in K$ ;  $h_1k_1h_2k_2 = h_1h_2k_1k_2$ ; if  $|h|$  and  $|k|$  are finite then  $|hk| = \operatorname{lcm}(|h|, |k|)$ , and so on. In short, the group  $HK$  has the same properties as the group  $H \oplus K$ . It is occasionally possible to do this.

# Definition Internal Direct Product of  $H$  and  $K$

We say that  $G$  is the internal direct product of  $H$  and  $K$  and write  $G = H \times K$  if  $H$  and  $K$  are normal subgroups of  $G$  and

$$
G = H K \quad \text {a n d} \quad H \cap K = \{e \}.
$$

The wording of the phrase "internal direct product" is easy to justify. We want to call  $G$  the internal direct product of  $H$  and  $K$  if  $H$  and  $K$  are subgroups of  $G$ , and if  $G$  is naturally isomorphic to the external direct product of  $H$  and  $K$ . One forms the internal direct product by starting with a group  $G$  and then proceeding to find two subgroups  $H$  and  $K$  within  $G$  such that  $G$  is isomorphic to the external direct product of  $H$  and  $K$ . (The definition ensures that this is the case—see Theorem 9.6.) On the other hand, one forms an external direct product by starting with any two groups  $H$  and  $K$ , related or not, and proceeding to produce the larger group  $H \oplus K$ . The difference between the two products is that the internal direct product can be formed within  $G$  itself, using subgroups of  $G$  and the operation of  $G$ , whereas the external direct product can be formed with totally unrelated groups by creating a new set and a new operation. (See Figures 9.1 and 9.2.)

![](images/60c29852b7f2ec0c9efcb954d21884e8e9565db535b1778e064923833265401a.jpg)  
Figure 9.1 For the internal direct product,  $H$  and  $K$  must be subgroups of the same group.

Figure 9.2 For the external direct product,  $H$  and  $K$  can be any groups.

Perhaps the following analogy with integers will be useful in clarifying the distinction between the two products of groups discussed in the preceding paragraph. Just as we may take any (finite) collection of integers and form their product, we may also take any collection of groups and form their external direct product. Conversely, just as we may start with a particular integer and express it as a product of certain of its divisors, we may be able to start with a particular group and factor it as an internal direct product of certain of its subgroups.

The next example recasts Theorem 8.3.

EXAMPLE 18 If  $s$  and  $t$  are relatively prime positive integers then  $U(st) = U_s(st) \times U_t(st)$ .

EXAMPLE 19  $D_{6}$ , the dihedral group of order 12, let  $F$  denote some reflection and let  $R_{k}$  denote a rotation of  $k$  degrees. Then,

$$
D _ {6} = \left\{R _ {0}, R _ {1 2 0}, R _ {2 4 0}, F, R _ {1 2 0} F, R _ {2 4 0} F \right\} \times \left\{R _ {0}, R _ {1 8 0} \right\}.
$$

Observe that Example 19 shows that  $D_{6}$  is isomorphic to  $D_{3} \oplus Z_{2}$ .

Students should be cautioned about the necessity of having all conditions of the definition of internal direct product satisfied to ensure that  $HK \approx H \oplus K$ . For example, if we take

$$
G = S _ {3}, \qquad H = \langle (1 2 3) \rangle , \qquad \text {a n d} \qquad K = \langle (1 2) \rangle ,
$$

then  $G = HK$ , and  $H \cap K = \{(1)\}$ . But  $G$  is not isomorphic to  $H \oplus K$  since, by Theorem 8.2,  $H \oplus K$ , is cyclic, whereas  $S_3$  is not. Note that  $K$  is not normal.

A group  $G$  can also be the internal direct product of a collection of subgroups.

Definition Internal Direct Product  $H_{1} \times H_{2} \times \dots \times H_{n}$

Let  $H_1, H_2, \ldots, H_n$  be a finite collection of normal subgroups of  $G$ . We say that  $G$  is the internal direct product of  $H_1, H_2, \ldots, H_n$  and write  $G = H_1 \times H_2 \times \dots \times H_n$ , if

1.  $G = H_{1}H_{2}\dots H_{n} = \{h_{1}h_{2}\dots h_{n}|h_{i}\in H_{i}\}$  
2.  $(H_{1}H_{2}\dots H_{i})\cap H_{i + 1} = \{e\}$  for  $i = 1,2,\ldots ,n - 1$

This definition is somewhat more complicated than the one given for two subgroups. The student may wonder about the motivation for it—that is, why should we want the subgroups to be normal and why is it desirable for each subgroup to be disjoint from the product of all previous ones? The reason is quite simple. We want the internal direct product to be isomorphic to the external direct product. As the next theorem shows, the conditions in the definition of internal direct product were chosen to ensure that the two products are isomorphic.

Theorem 9.6  $H_{1} \times H_{2} \times \dots \times H_{n} \approx H_{1} \oplus H_{2} \oplus \dots \oplus H_{n}$

If a group  $G$  is the internal direct product of a finite number of subgroups  $H_{1}, H_{2}, \ldots, H_{n}$ , then  $G$  is isomorphic to the external direct product of  $H_{1}, H_{2}, \ldots, H_{n}$ .

PROOF We first show that the normality of the  $H$ 's together with the second condition of the definition guarantees that  $h$ 's from different  $H_{i}$ 's commute. For if  $h_{i} \in H_{i}$  and  $h_{j} \in H_{j}$  with  $i \neq j$ , then

$$
\left(h _ {i} h _ {j} h _ {i} ^ {- 1}\right) h _ {j} ^ {- 1} \in H _ {j} h _ {j} ^ {- 1} = H _ {j}
$$

and

$$
h _ {i} \left(h _ {j} h _ {i} ^ {- 1} h _ {j} ^ {- 1}\right) \in h _ {i} H _ {i} = H _ {i}.
$$

Thus,  $h_i h_j h_i^{-1} h_j^{-1} \in H_i \cap H_j = \{e\}$  (see Exercise 5), and, therefore,  $h_i h_j = h_j h_i$ . We next claim that each member of  $G$  can be expressed uniquely in the form  $h_1 h_2 \cdots h_n$ , where  $h_i \in H_i$ . That there is at least one such representation is the content of condition 1 of the definition. To prove uniqueness, suppose that  $g = h_1 h_2 \cdots h_n$  and  $g = h_1' h_2' \cdots h_n'$ , where  $h_i$  and  $h_i'$  belong to  $H_i$  for  $i = 1, \ldots, n$ . Then, using the fact that the  $h$ 's from different  $H_i$ 's commute, we can solve the equation

$$
h _ {1} h _ {2} \dots h _ {n} = h _ {1} ^ {\prime} h _ {2} ^ {\prime} \dots h _ {n} ^ {\prime} \tag {9.1}
$$

for  $h_n^\prime h_n^{-1}$  to obtain

$$
h _ {n} ^ {\prime} h _ {n} ^ {- 1} = \left(h _ {1} ^ {\prime}\right) ^ {- 1} h _ {1} \left(h _ {2} ^ {\prime}\right) ^ {- 1} h _ {2} \dots \left(h _ {n - 1} ^ {\prime}\right) ^ {- 1} h _ {n - 1}.
$$

But then

$$
h _ {n} ^ {\prime} h _ {n} ^ {- 1} \in H _ {1} H _ {2} \dots H _ {n - 1} \cap H _ {n} = \{e \},
$$

so that  $h_n^\prime h_n^{-1} = e$  and, therefore,  $h_n^\prime = h_n$ . At this point, we can cancel  $h_n$  and  $h_n^\prime$  from opposite sides of the equal sign in Equation (9.1) and repeat the preceding argument to obtain  $h_{n - 1} = h_{n - 1}^{\prime}$ . Continuing in this fashion, we eventually have  $h_i = h_i^\prime$  for  $i = 1,\dots ,n$ . With our claim established, we may now define a function  $\phi$  from  $G$  to  $H_{1}\oplus H_{2}\oplus \dots \oplus H_{n}$  by  $\phi (h_1h_2\dots h_n) = (h_1,h_2,\dots ,h_n)$ . We leave to the reader the easy verification that  $\phi$  is an isomorphism.

When we have a group  $G = H \times K$  the essence of Theorem 9.6 is that in  $H \oplus K$  the product  $(h_1, k_1)(h_2, k_2) = (h_1 h_2, k_1 k_2)$  is the same as  $h_1 h_2 k_1 k_2$  in  $H \times K$ . So, the operation in  $H \oplus K$  can be done inside  $HK$  by ignoring the parentheses and commas to separate the members of  $H$  and  $K$ .

The  $U$ -groups provide a convenient way to illustrate the preceding ideas and to clarify the distinction between internal and external direct products. It follows directly from Theorem 8.3, its corollary, and Theorem 9.6 that if  $m = n_1n_2\dots n_k$ , where  $\gcd(n_i,n_j) = 1$  for  $i \neq j$ , then

$$
\begin{array}{l} U (m) = U _ {m / n _ {1}} (m) \times U _ {m / n _ {2}} (m) \times \dots \times U _ {m / n _ {k}} (m) \\ \approx U (n _ {1}) \oplus U (n _ {2}) \oplus \dots \oplus U (n _ {k}). \\ \end{array}
$$

Let us return to the examples given following Theorem 8.3.

$$
\begin{array}{l} U (1 0 5) = U (1 5 \cdot 7) = U _ {1 5} (1 0 5) \times U _ {7} (1 0 5) \\ = \{1, 1 6, 3 1, 4 6, 6 1, 7 6 \} \times \{1, 8, 2 2, 2 9, 4 3, 6 4, 7 1, 9 2 \} \\ \approx U (7) \oplus U (1 5), \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} U (1 0 5) = U (5 \cdot 2 1) = U _ {5} (1 0 5) \times U _ {2 1} (1 0 5) \\ = \{1, 1 1, 1 6, 2 6, 3 1, 4 1, 4 6, 6 1, 7 1, 7 6, 8 6, 1 0 1 \} \\ \times \{1, 2 2, 4 3, 6 4 \} \approx U (2 1) \oplus U (5), \\ \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} U (1 0 5) = U (3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7) = U _ {3 5} (1 0 5) \times U _ {2 1} (1 0 5) \times U _ {1 5} (1 0 5) \\ = \{1, 7 1 \} \times \{1, 2 2, 4 3, 6 4 \} \times \{1, 1 6, 3 1, 4 6, 6 1, 7 6 \} \\ \approx U (3) \oplus U (5) \oplus U (7). \\ \end{array}
$$

The above ideas provide an easy way to find various subgroups of  $U$ -groups.

EXAMPLE 20 We find subgroups of  $U(1000)$  orders 4, 100, and 200. From Theorem 8.3, we have  $U(1000) \approx U(8) \oplus U(125) \approx U_{125}(1000) \oplus U_8(1000) \approx Z_2 \oplus Z_2 \oplus Z_{100}$ . So subgroups of  $U(1000)$  of orders 4 and 100 are  $U_{125}(1000) = \{1, 251, 501, 751\}$  and  $U_8(1000)$ , respectively. Since 251 has order 2 the subgroup  $\langle 251 \rangle U_8(1000)$  has order 200.

As applications of Theorem 9.6 we next prove two classification theorems. But first we pause to review the classification theorems we have proved thus far. Note that Theorem 9.8 generalizes the last result on this list below to all primes  $p$ .

- Classification of subgroups of finite cyclic groups: There is exactly one subgroup for each divisor of the order of the group and no others.  
- Classification of groups of prime order: Every group of prime order  $p$  is isomorphic to  $Z_p$ .  
- Classification of groups of  $2p$  where  $p$  is an odd prime: Every group of order  $2p$  where  $p$  is prime is isomorphic to  $Z_{2p}$  or  $D_p$ .  
- Classification of groups of 4: Every group of order 4 is isomorphic to  $Z_{4}$  or  $Z_{2} \oplus Z_{2}$ .

# Theorem 9.7 Classification of finite Abelian groups of square-free order

Every Abelian group of order  $p_1p_2 \cdots p_k$  where the  $p_i$  are distinct primes is cyclic.

PROOF Let  $G$  be a group of order  $p_1p_2\cdots p_k$  where the  $p_i$  are distinct primes. By Cauchy's Theorem  $G$  has subgroups  $H_i$  of order  $p_i$  for  $i = 1,2,\ldots,k$ . It follows from Theorem 7.2 and Lagrange's Theorem that  $G = H_1\times H_2\times \dots \times H_k$ . Then, by Theorem 9.6 and Corollary 1 of Theorem 8.2, we have that  $G$  is cyclic.

# Theorem 9.8 Classification of Groups of Order  $p^2$

Every group of order  $p^2$ , where  $p$  is a prime, is isomorphic to  $Z_{p^2}$  or  $Z_p \oplus Z_p$ .

PROOF Let  $G$  be a group of order  $p^2$ , where  $p$  is a prime. If  $G$  has an element of order  $p^2$ , then  $G$  is isomorphic to  $Z_{p^2}$ . So, by Corollary 2 of Lagrange's Theorem, we may assume that every nonidentity element of  $G$  has order  $p$ . First we show that for any element  $a$ , the subgroup  $\langle a \rangle$  is normal in  $G$ . If this is not the case, then there is an element  $b$  in  $G$  such that  $b\langle a \rangle b^{-1} = \langle bab^{-1} \rangle \not\subseteq \langle a \rangle$ . Then  $\langle a \rangle$  and  $\langle bab^{-1} \rangle$  are distinct subgroups of order  $p$ . Since  $\langle a \rangle \cap \langle bab^{-1} \rangle$  is a subgroup of both  $\langle a \rangle$  and  $\langle bab^{-1} \rangle$ , we have that  $\langle a \rangle \cap \langle bab^{-1} \rangle = \{e\}$ . From this it follows that the distinct left cosets of  $\langle bab^{-1} \rangle$  are  $\langle bab^{-1} \rangle, a\langle bab^{-1} \rangle, a^2\langle bab^{-1} \rangle, \ldots, a^{p-1}\langle bab^{-1} \rangle$ . Since  $b^{-1}$  must lie in one

of these cosets, we may write  $b^{-1}$  in the form  $b^{-1} = a^i (bab^{-1})^j = a^i ba^j b^{-1}$  for some  $i$  and  $j$ . Canceling the  $b^{-1}$  terms, we obtain  $e = a^i ba^j$  and therefore  $b = a^{-1 - j} \in \langle a \rangle$ . This contradiction verifies our assertion that every subgroup of the form  $\langle a \rangle$  is normal in  $G$ . To complete the proof, let  $x$  be any nonidentity element in  $G$  and  $y$  be any element of  $G$  not in  $\langle x \rangle$ . Then, by comparing orders and using Theorem 9.6, we see that  $G = \langle x \rangle \times \langle y \rangle \approx Z_p \oplus Z_p$ .

As an immediate corollary of Theorem 9.8, we have the following important fact.

# Corollary

If  $G$  is a group of order  $p^2$ , where  $p$  is a prime, then  $G$  is Abelian.

We mention in passing that if  $G = H_{1} \oplus H_{2} \oplus \dots \oplus H_{n}$ , then  $G$  can be expressed as the internal direct product of subgroups isomorphic to  $H_{1}, H_{2}, \ldots, H_{n}$ . For example, if  $G = H_{1} \oplus H_{2}$ , then  $G = \overline{H}_{1} \times \overline{H}_{2}$ , where  $\overline{H}_{1} = H_{1} \oplus \{e\}$  and  $\overline{H}_{2} = \{e\} \oplus H_{2}$ .

The topic of direct products is one in which notation and terminology vary widely. Many authors use  $H \times K$  to denote both the internal direct product and the external direct product of  $H$  and  $K$ , making no notational distinction between the two products. A few authors define only the external direct product. Many people reserve the notation  $H \oplus K$  for the situation where  $H$  and  $K$  are Abelian groups under addition and call it the direct sum of  $H$  and  $K$ . In fact, we will adopt this terminology in the section on rings (Part 3), since rings are always Abelian groups under addition.

This chapter is packed with many new ideas. Let us recap the key takeaway. A nontrivial finite factor group  $G / H$  of a group  $G$  is a smaller and simpler version of  $G$ . Many properties of  $G$  are inherited by  $G / H$  and, conversely, many properties of  $G$  can be inferred from properties of  $G / H$ . Factor groups are particularly useful when induction on the order of  $G$  is used to prove something about the group.

Going clockwise, the product of two consecutive elements is the third one. The same is true for going counterclockwise, except that we obtain the negative of the third element. This group is called the quaternions.

# Évariste Galois

This letter, if judged by the novelty and profundity of ideas it contains, is perhaps the most substantial piece of writing in the whole literature of mankind.

HERMANN WEYL commenting on Galois's papers.

Galois at seventeen was making discoveries of epochal significance in the theory of equations, discoveries whose consequences are not yet exhausted after more than a century.

E. T. BELL, Men of Mathematics

ÉVARISTE GALOIS (pronounced gal-WAH) had at once an inspiring and tragically short life. He was born on October 25, 1811, near Paris. Although he had mastered the works of Legendre and Lagrange at age 15, Galois twice failed his entrance examination to the École Polytechnique. He did not know some basic mathematics, and he did mathematics almost entirely in his head, to the annoyance of the examiner.

At 18, Galois wrote his important research on the theory of equations and submitted it to the French Academy of Sciences for publication. The paper was given to Cauchy for refereeing. Cauchy, impressed by the paper, agreed to present it to the academy, but he never did. At the age of 19, Galois entered a paper of the highest quality in the competition for the Grand Prize in Mathematics given by the

French Academy of Sciences. The paper was given to Fourier who died shortly thereafter. Galois's paper was never seen again. Galois spent most of the last year and a half of his life in prison for revolutionary political offenses. While in prison, he attempted suicide and prophesied that he would die in a duel. On May 30, 1832, Galois was shot in a duel; he died the next day at the age of 20.

Among the many concepts introduced by Galois are normal subgroups, isomorphisms, simple groups, finite fields, and Galois theory. His work provided a method for disposing of several famous constructability problems, such as trisecting an arbitrary angle and doubling a cube. In his book Love and Math Edward Frenkel wrote "His [Galois's] brilliant insight has forever changed the way people think about numbers and equations." Galois's entire works fill only 60 pages.

# Group Homomorphisms

When it comes to laws, there is absolutely no doubt that symmetry and group theory are extremely useful concepts. Without the introduction of symmetry and the language of groups into particle physics the description of the elementary particles and their interactions would have been an intricate nightmare. Groups truly flesh out order and identify patterns like no other mathematical machinery.

Mario Livio, The Equation That Couldn't be Solved

In a certain sense the subject of group theory is built up out of three basic concepts: that of a homomorphism, that of a normal subgroup, and that of the factor group of a group by a normal subgroup.

I. N. Herstein, Abstract Algebra, 3rd ed.

# Definition and Examples

In this chapter, we consider one of the most fundamental ideas of algebra—homomorphisms. The term homomorphism comes from the Greek words homo, "like," and morphe, "form." We will see that a homomorphism is a natural generalization of an isomorphism and that there is an intimate connection between factor groups of a group and homomorphisms of a group. The concept of group homomorphisms was introduced by Camille Jordan in 1870, in his influential book Traité des substitutions.

# Definition Group Homomorphism

A homomorphism  $\phi$  from a group  $G$  to a group  $\overline{G}$  is a mapping from  $G$  into  $\overline{G}$  that preserves the group operation; that is,  $\phi(ab) = \phi(a)\phi(b)$  for all  $a, b$  in  $G$ .

Before giving examples and stating numerous properties of homomorphisms, it is convenient to introduce an important subgroup that is intimately related to the image of a homomorphism. (See property 4 of Theorem 10.1.)

# Definition Kernel of a Homomorphism

The kernel of a homomorphism  $\phi$  from a group  $G$  to a group with identity  $e$  is the set  $\{x \in G \mid \phi(x) = e\}$ . The kernel of  $\phi$  is denoted by  $\operatorname{Ker} \phi$ .

EXAMPLE 1 Any isomorphism is a homomorphism that is also onto and one-to-one. The kernel of an isomorphism is the trivial subgroup.

EXAMPLE 2 Let  $\mathbf{R}^*$  be the group of nonzero real numbers under multiplication. Then the determinant mapping  $A \to \operatorname{det} A$  is a homomorphism from  $GL(2, \mathbf{R})$  to  $\mathbf{R}^*$ . The kernel of the determinant mapping is  $SL(2, \mathbf{R})$ .

EXAMPLE 3 The mapping  $\phi$  from  $\mathbf{R}^*$  to  $\mathbf{R}^*$ , defined by  $\phi(x) = |x|$ , is a homomorphism with  $\operatorname{Ker} \phi = \{1, -1\}$ .

EXAMPLE 4 Let  $\mathbf{R}[x]$  denote the group of all polynomials with real coefficients under addition. For any  $f$  in  $\mathbf{R}[x]$ , let  $f'$  denote the derivative of  $f$ . Then the mapping  $f \to f'$  is a homomorphism from  $\mathbf{R}[x]$  to itself. The kernel of the derivative mapping is the set of all constant polynomials.

EXAMPLE 5 The mapping  $\phi$  from  $Z$  to  $Z_{n}$ , defined by  $\phi(m) = m \bmod n$ , is a homomorphism (see Exercise 11 in Chapter 0). The kernel of this mapping is  $\langle n \rangle$ .

EXAMPLE 6 Let  $i$  denote the complex number  $\sqrt{-1}$ . The set  $Z[i] = \{a + bi \mid a, b \in Z\}$  under addition is subgroup of the complex numbers called the Gaussian integers. For a positive integer  $n$  the set  $Z_{n}[i] = \{a + bi \mid a, b \in Z_{n}\}$  under addition modulo  $n$  is a group called the Gaussian integers modulo  $n$ . The mapping from  $Z[i]$  onto  $Z_{n}[i]$  defined by  $\phi(a + bi) = a \mod n + (b \mod n)i$  is a homomorphism. The kernel of this mapping is  $\{sn + tni \mid s, t \in Z\}$ .

Our algorithm for expressing  $U(n)$  as an internal direct product of proper subgroups provides us with a simple way to define homomorphisms from  $U(n)$  to  $U(n)$  with a designated kernel (see Exercise 9).

EXAMPLE 7 Expressing  $U(40) = U_5(40) \times U_8(40)$  in the form  $U_5(40)U_8(40) = \{ab \mid a \in U_5(40), b \in U_{(8}(40)\}$  the mapping from  $U(40)$  to  $U(40)$  defined by  $\phi(ab) = a$  is a homomorphism with kernel  $U_8(40)$ . The mapping from  $U(40)$  to  $U(40)$  defined by  $\phi(ab) = b$  is a homomorphism with kernel  $U_5(40)$ .

EXAMPLE 8 The mapping  $\phi(x) = x^2$  from  $\mathbf{R}$ , the real numbers under addition, to itself is not a homomorphism, since  $\phi(a + b) = (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$ , whereas  $\phi(a) + \phi(b) = a^2 + b^2$ .

When defining a homomorphism from a group in which there are several ways to represent the elements, caution must be exercised to ensure that the correspondence is a function. (The term well-defined is often used in this context.) For example, since  $3(x + y) = 3x + 3y$  in  $Z_6$ , one might believe that the correspondence  $x + \langle 3 \rangle \to 3x$  from  $Z / \langle 3 \rangle$  to  $Z_6$  is a homomorphism. But it is not a function, since  $0 + \langle 3 \rangle = 3 + \langle 3 \rangle$  in  $Z / \langle 3 \rangle$  but  $3 \cdot 0 \neq 3 \cdot 3$  in  $Z_6$ .

For students who have had linear algebra, we remark that every linear transformation is a group homomorphism and the null-space is the same as the kernel. An invertible linear transformation is a group isomorphism.

# Properties of Homomorphisms

# Theorem 10.1 Properties of Elements Under Homomorphisms

Let  $\phi$  be a homomorphism from a group  $G$  to a group  $\overline{G}$  and let  $g$  be an element of  $G$ . Then

1.  $\phi$  carries the identity of  $G$  to the identity of  $\overline{G}$ .  
2.  $\phi(g^n) = (\phi(g))^n$  for all  $n$  in  $Z$ .  
3. If  $|g|$  is finite, then  $|\phi(g)|$  divides  $|g|$  and if  $|G|$  is finite then  $|\phi(g)|$  divides  $|g|$  and  $|\phi(G)|$ .  
4. Ker  $\phi$  is a subgroup of  $G$ .  
5.  $\phi (a) = \phi (b)$  if and only if aKer  $\phi = b\mathrm{Ker}\phi$  
6. If  $\phi(g) = \overline{g}$ , then  $\phi^{-1}(\overline{g}) = \{x \in G \mid \phi(x) = \overline{g}\} = g\mathrm{Ker} \phi$ .

PROOF The proofs of properties 1 and 2 are identical to the proofs of properties 1 and 2 of isomorphisms in Theorem 6.2. To prove property 3, notice that properties 1 and 2 together with  $g^n = e$  imply that  $e = \phi(e) = \phi(g^n) = (\phi(g))^n$ . So, by Corollary 2 to Theorem 4.1, we have  $|\phi(g)|$  divides  $n$ . That  $|\phi(g)|$  divides  $|\phi(G)|$  when  $G|$  is finite follows from Lagrange's Theorem.

By property 1 we know that  $\operatorname{Ker} \phi$  is not empty. So, to prove property 4, we assume that  $a, b \in \operatorname{Ker} \phi$  and show that  $ab^{-1} \in \operatorname{Ker} \phi$ . Since  $\phi(a) = e$  and  $\phi(b) = e$ , we have  $\phi(ab^{-1}) = \phi(a)\phi(b^{-1}) = \phi(a)(\phi(b))^{-1} = ee^{-1} = e$ . So,  $ab^{-1} \in \operatorname{Ker} \phi$ .

To prove property 5, first assume that  $\phi(a) = \phi(b)$ . Then  $e = (\phi(b))^{-1}\phi(a) = \phi(b^{-1})\phi(a) = \phi(b^{-1}a)$ , so that  $b^{-1}a \in \operatorname{Ker} \phi$ . It now follows from property 6 of the lemma in Chapter 7 that  $b\operatorname{Ker} \phi = a\operatorname{Ker} \phi$ . Reversing this argument completes the proof.

To prove property 6, we must show that  $\phi^{-1}(\overline{g}) \subseteq g\mathrm{Ker}\phi$  and that  $g\mathrm{Ker}\phi \subseteq \phi^{-1}(\overline{g})$ . For the first inclusion, let  $x \in \phi^{-1}(\overline{g})$ , so that  $\phi(x) = \overline{g}$ . Then  $\phi(g) = \phi(x)$  and by property 5 we have  $g\mathrm{Ker}\phi = x\mathrm{Ker}\phi$  and therefore  $x \in g\mathrm{Ker}\phi$ . This completes the proof that  $\phi^{-1}(\overline{g}) \subseteq g\mathrm{Ker}\phi$ . To prove that  $g\mathrm{Ker}\phi \subseteq \phi^{-1}(\overline{g})$ , suppose that  $k \in \mathrm{Ker}\phi$ . Then  $\phi(gk) = \phi(g)\phi(k) = \overline{g}e = \overline{G}$ . Thus, by definition,  $gk \in \phi^{-1}(\overline{g})$ .

Since homomorphisms preserve the group operation, it should not be a surprise that they preserve many group properties.

# Theorem 10.2 Properties of Subgroups Under Homomorphisms

Let  $\phi$  be a homomorphism from a group  $G$  to a group  $\overline{G}$  and let  $H$  be a subgroup of  $G$ . Then

1.  $\phi (H) = \{\phi (h)\mid h\in H\}$  is a subgroup of  $\overline{G}$  
2. If  $H$  is cyclic, then  $\phi(H)$  is cyclic.  
3. If  $H$  is Abelian, then  $\phi(H)$  is Abelian.  
4. If  $H$  is normal in  $G$ , then  $\phi(H)$  is normal in  $\phi(G)$ .  
5. If  $|\mathrm{Ker} \phi| = n$ , then  $\phi$  is an  $n$ -to-1 mapping from  $G$  onto  $\phi(G)$ .

6. If  $H$  is finite, then  $|\phi(H)|$  divides  $|H|$ .  
7.  $\phi(Z(G))$  is a subgroup of  $Z(\phi(G))$ .  
8. If  $\overline{K}$  is a subgroup of  $\overline{G}$  then  $\phi^{-1}(\overline{K}) = \{k \in G \mid \phi(k) \in \overline{K}\}$  is a subgroup of  $G$ .  
9. If  $\overline{K}$  is a normal subgroup of  $\overline{G}$ , then  $\phi^{-1}(\overline{K}) = \{k \in G \mid \phi(k) \in \overline{K}\}$  is a normal subgroup of  $G$ .  
10. If  $\phi$  is onto and  $\operatorname{Ker} \phi = \{e\}$ , then  $\phi$  is an isomorphism from  $G$  to  $\overline{G}$ .

PROOF First note that the proofs of properties 1, 2, and 3 are identical to the proofs of properties 4, 3, 2, and 6, respectively, of Theorem 6.2, since those proofs use only the fact that an isomorphism is an operation-preserving mapping.

To prove property 4, let  $\phi(h) \in \phi(H)$  and  $\phi(g) \in \phi(G)$ . Then  $\phi(g)\phi(h)\phi(g)^{-1} = \phi(ghg^{-1}) \in \phi(H)$ , since  $H$  is normal in  $G$ .

Property 5 follows directly from property 6 of Theorem 10.1 and the fact that all cosets of  $\operatorname{Ker} \phi = \phi^{-1}(e)$  have the same number of elements.

To prove property 6, let  $\phi_H$  denote the restriction of  $\phi$  to the elements of  $H$ . Then  $\phi_H$  is a homomorphism from  $H$  onto  $\phi(H)$ . Suppose  $|\mathrm{Ker} \phi_H| = t$ . Then, by property 5,  $\phi_H$  is a  $t$ -to-1 mapping. So,  $|\phi(H)|t = |H|$ .

To prove property 8, we use the One-Step Subgroup Test. Clearly,  $e \in \phi^{-1}(\overline{K})$ , so that  $\phi^{-1}(\overline{K})$  is not empty. Let  $k_{1}, k_{2} \in \phi^{-1}(\overline{K})$ . Then, by the definition of  $\phi^{-1}(\overline{K})$ , we know that  $\phi(k_{1}), \phi(k_{2}) \in \overline{K}$ . Thus,  $\phi(k_{2})^{-1} \in \overline{K}$  as well and  $\phi(k_{1}k_{2}^{-1}) = \phi(k_{1})\phi(k_{2})^{-1} \in \overline{K}$ . So, by the definition of  $\phi^{-1}(\overline{K})$ , we have  $k_{1}k_{2}^{-1} \in \phi^{-1}(\overline{K})$ .

To prove property 9, we use the normality test given in Theorem 9.1. Note that every element in  $x\phi^{-1}(\overline{K})x^{-1}$  has the form  $xkx^{-1}$ , where  $\phi (k)\in \overline{K}$ . Thus, since  $\overline{K}$  is normal in  $\overline{G}$ ,  $\phi (xkx^{-1}) = \phi (x)\phi (k)(\phi (x))^{-1}\in \overline{K}$ , and, therefore,  $xkx^{-1}\in \phi^{-1}(\overline{K})$ .

Finally, property 10 follows directly from property 5.

A few remarks about Theorems 10.1 and 10.2 are in order. Students should remember the various properties of these theorems in words. For example, properties 2 and 3 of Theorem 10.2 say that the homomorphic image of a cyclic group is cyclic and the homomorphic image of an Abelian group is Abelian. Property 4 of Theorem 10.2 says that the homomorphic image of a normal subgroup of  $G$  is normal in the image of  $G$ . Property 5 of Theorem 10.2 says that if  $\phi$  is a homomorphism from  $G$  to  $\overline{G}$ , then every element of  $\overline{G}$  that gets "hit" by  $\phi$  gets hit the same number of times as does the identity. Thus, the kernel of a group homomorphism measures how far off the homomorphism is from being one-to-one: the larger the kernel, the less the image resembles the group. The set  $\phi^{-1}(\overline{g})$  defined in property 6 of Theorem 10.1 is called the inverse image of  $\overline{g}$  (or the pullback of  $\overline{g}$ ). Note that the inverse image of an element is a coset of the kernel and that every element in that coset has the same image. Similarly, the set  $\phi^{-1}(\overline{K})$  defined in property 8 of Theorem 10.2 is called the inverse image of  $\overline{K}$  (or the pullback of  $\overline{K}$ ).

If  $\phi(g) = \overline{g}$  and  $\phi(H) = \overline{H}$ , here is the way to think about the elements of  $\phi^{-1}(\overline{g})$  and  $\phi^{-1}(\overline{H})$ . The set  $\phi^{-1}(\overline{g}) = g\mathrm{Ker}\phi$  is the answer to the question:

"Which elements in  $G$  map to  $\overline{g}$ ?," and the set  $\phi^{-1}(\overline{H}) = H\mathrm{Ker}$  is the answer to the question: "Which elements in  $G$  map to  $\phi(\overline{H})$ ?"

Property 6 of Theorem 10.1 is reminiscent of something from linear algebra and differential equations. Recall that if  $x$  is a particular solution to a system of linear equations and  $S$  is the entire solution set of the corresponding homogeneous system of linear equations, then  $x + S$  is the entire solution set of the nonhomogeneous system. In reality, this statement is just a special case of property 6. Properties 1 and 6 of Theorem 10.1 and property 5 of Theorem 10.2 are pictorially represented in Figure 10.1.

The special case of property 9 of Theorem 10.2, where  $\overline{K} = \{e\}$ , is of such importance that we single it out.

# Corollary Kernels are Normal

Let  $\phi$  be a group homomorphism from  $G$  to  $\overline{G}$ . Then  $\operatorname{Ker} \phi$  is a normal subgroup of  $G$ .

The next three examples illustrate several properties of Theorems 10.1 and 10.2.

EXAMPLE 9 Consider the mapping  $\phi$  from  $\mathbf{C}^*$  to  $\mathbf{C}^*$  given by  $\phi(x) = x^4$ . Since  $(xy)^4 = x^4y^4$ ,  $\phi$  is a homomorphism. Clearly,  $\operatorname{Ker}\phi = \{x \mid x^4 = 1\} = \{1, -1, i - i\}$ . So, by property 5 of Theorem 10.2, we know that  $\phi$  is a 4-to-1 mapping. Now let's find all elements that map to, say, 2. Certainly,  $\phi(\sqrt[4]{2}) = 2$ . Then, by property 6 of Theorem 10.1, the set of all elements that map to 2 is  $\sqrt[4]{2}\operatorname{Ker}\phi = \{\sqrt[4]{2}, -\sqrt[4]{2}, \sqrt[4]{2}i, -\sqrt[4]{2}i\}$ .

Figure 10.1 Homomorphism from  $G$  to  $\overline{G}$

Finally, we verify a specific instance of property 3 of Theorem 10.1 and of properties 2 and 6 of Theorem 10.2. Let  $H = \langle \cos 30^\circ + i \sin 30^\circ \rangle$ . It follows from DeMoivre's Theorem (Example 12 in Chapter 0) that  $|H| = 12$ ,  $\phi(H) = \langle \cos 120^\circ + i \sin 120^\circ \rangle$ , and  $|\phi(H)| = 3$ .

EXAMPLE 10 Define  $\phi: Z_{12} \to Z_{12}$  by  $\phi(x) = 3x$ . To verify that  $\phi$  is a homomorphism, we observe that in  $Z_{12}, 3(a + b) = 3a + 3b$  (since the group operation is addition modulo 12). Direct calculations show that  $\operatorname{Ker} \phi = \{0,4,8\}$ . Thus, we know from property 5 of Theorem 10.2 that  $\phi$  is a 3-to-1 mapping. Since  $\phi(2) = 6$ , we have by property 6 of Theorem 10.1 that  $\phi^{-1}(6) = 2 + \operatorname{Ker} \phi = \{2,6,10\}$ . Notice also that  $\langle 2 \rangle$  is cyclic and  $\phi(\langle 2 \rangle) = \{0,6\}$  is cyclic. Moreover,  $|2| = 6$  and  $|\phi(2)| = |6| = 2$ , so  $|\phi(2)|$  divides  $|2|$  in agreement with property 3 of Theorem 10.1. Letting  $\overline{K} = \{0,6\}$ , we see that the subgroup  $\phi^{-1}(\overline{K}) = \{0,2,4,6,8,10\}$ . This verifies property 8 of Theorem 10.2 in this particular case.

The next example illustrates how one can easily determine all homomorphisms from a cyclic group to a cyclic group.

EXAMPLE 11 We determine all homomorphisms from  $Z_{12}$  to  $Z_{30}$ . By property 2 of Theorem 10.1, such a homomorphism is completely specified by the image of 1. That is, if 1 maps to  $k$ , then  $x$  maps to  $xk$ . Lagrange's Theorem and property 3 of Theorem 10.1 require that  $|k|$  divide both 12 and 30. So,  $|k| = 1, 2, 3$ , or 6. Thus,  $k = 0, 15, 10, 20, 5$ , or 25. This gives us a list of candidates for the homomorphisms. That all six of these possibilities yield a well-defined function can be verified at the same time by noting that all six possibilities for  $k$  have the form  $5s$ . Now note that if  $a = b \mod 12$ , then  $a - b = 12t$  for some integer  $t$  and this implies that  $5sa - 5sb = 5s(a - b) = 5s(12t) = 30(2st) = 0 \mod 30$ . So,  $\phi(a) = \phi(b)$  in  $Z_{12}$ . Finally, we have that  $\phi(a + b) = k(a + b) = ka + kb = \phi(a) + \phi(b)$ . [Note that  $\gcd(12, 36) = 6$ . This is not a coincidence!]

Exercise 5 provides a simple why to determine all homomorphisms from  $Z_{m}$  to  $Z_{n}$ .

EXAMPLE 12 The mapping from  $S_{n}$  to  $Z_{2}$  that takes an even permutation to 0 and an odd permutation to 1 is a homomorphism. Figure 10.2 illustrates the telescoping nature of the mapping.

Often a "non-example" is insightful.

EXAMPLE 13 Is the correspondence from  $Z_{18}$  to  $Z_{12}$  given by  $x \to 3x$  a homomorphism? Since 3 divides both 18 and 12, it seems plausible. Let's suppose that it is. To obtain a contradiction all we need do is find some  $a$  and  $b$  in  $Z_{18}$  such that  $\phi(a + b) \neq \phi(a) + \phi(b)$ . Let's try  $\phi(7 + 6) = \phi(13) = 39 = 3 \mod 12$  and  $\phi(7) + \phi(6) = 21 + 18 = 39$ . No contradiction in this case. But this is because  $7 + 6 = 13$  is less than 18. So, we did not use mod 18 to do the sum. In contrast,  $\phi(10 + 8) = \phi(18) = \phi(0) = 0$ , whereas,  $\phi(10) + \phi(8) = 30 + 24 = 54 = 6 \mod 12$ , a contradiction.

Another way to get a contradiction is to observe that  $\phi(1) = 3$ , so by Part 3 of Theorem 10.1, we must have that  $|\phi(1)| = |3| = 4$  must divide 18.

This raises the question: "Is there an easy way to determine if the correspondence  $x \to kx$  is a homomorphism from  $Z_{m}$  to  $Z_{n}$  by just looking at  $k, m$ , and  $n$ ?" Indeed, there is. The correspondence is a homomorphism if and only if  $n$  divides  $km$ . See Exercise 31.

# The First Isomorphism Theorem

In Chapter 9, we showed that for a group  $G$  and a normal subgroup  $H$ , we could arrange the Cayley table of  $G$  into boxes that represented the cosets of  $H$  in  $G$ , and that these boxes then became a Cayley table for  $G / H$ . The next theorem shows that for any homomorphism  $\phi$  of  $G$  and the normal subgroup  $\operatorname{Ker} \phi$ , the same process produces a Cayley table isomorphic to the homomorphic image of  $G$ . Thus, homomorphisms, like factor groups, cause a systematic collapse of a group to a simpler but closely related group. This can be likened to viewing a group through the reverse end of a telescope—the general features of the group are present, but the apparent size is diminished. The important relationship between homomorphisms and factor groups given below is often called the Fundamental Theorem of Group Homomorphisms.

# Theorem 10.3 First Isomorphism Theorem (Jordan, 1870)

Let  $\phi$  be a group homomorphism from  $G$  to  $\overline{G}$ . Then the mapping from  $G / \mathrm{Ker} \phi$  to  $\phi(G)$ , given by  $g\mathrm{Ker} \phi \to \phi(g)$ , is an isomorphism. In symbols,  $G / \mathrm{Ker} \phi \approx \phi(G)$ .

PROOF Let us use  $\psi$  to denote the correspondence  $g\mathrm{Ker}\phi \to \phi (g)$ . That  $\psi$  is well-defined (i.e., the correspondence is independent of the particular coset representative chosen) and one-to-one follows directly from property 5 of Theorem 10.1. To show that  $\psi$  is operation-preserving, observe that  $\psi (x\mathrm{Ker}\phi y\mathrm{Ker}\phi) = \psi (xy\mathrm{Ker}\phi) = \phi (xy) = \phi (x)\phi (y) = \psi (x\mathrm{Ker}\phi)\psi (y\mathrm{Ker}\phi)$ .

The beauty of Theorem 10.3 is that we can use homomorphisms to gain insight about a factor group and the group itself and we can use factor groups to gain insight about homomorphisms and homomorphic images. For example, noting that the subgroup of  $A_4$  of order 4 given in Example 9 in Chapter 9 is normal in  $S_4$  we can deduce that  $S_3$  is the homomorphic image of  $S_4$  (see Exercise 43). Similarly, Example 5 in Chapter 7 implies that  $Z_2$  is not the homomorphic image of  $A_4$ .

The following useful corollary of Theorem 10.3 is immediate.

# Corollary 1

If  $\phi$  is a homomorphism from a finite group  $G$  to  $\overline{G}$ , then  $|G| / |\mathrm{Ker} \, \phi| = |\phi(G)|$ .

The next corollary follows directly from Theorem 10.3, property 1 of Theorem 10.2, and Lagrange's Theorem.

# Corollary 2

If  $\phi$  is a homomorphism from a finite group  $G$  to  $\overline{G}$ , then  $|\phi(G)|$  divides  $|G|$  and  $|\overline{G}|$ .

EXAMPLE 14 To illustrate Theorem 10.3 and its proof, consider the homomorphism  $\phi$  from  $D_4$  to itself given by the following:

$$
R _ {0}, R _ {1 8 0} \longrightarrow R _ {0}
$$

$$
R _ {9 0}, R _ {2 7 0} \longrightarrow H
$$

$$
H, V \longrightarrow R _ {1 8 0}
$$

$$
D, D ^ {\prime} \longrightarrow V.
$$

Then  $\mathrm{Ker}\phi = \{R_0,R_{180}\}$ , and the mapping  $\psi$  in Theorem 10.3 is  $R_0\mathrm{Ker}\phi \to R_0$ ,  $R_{90}\mathrm{Ker}\phi \to H$ ,  $H\mathrm{Ker}\phi \to R_{180}$ ,  $D\mathrm{Ker}\phi \to V$ . It is straightforward to verify that the mapping  $\psi$  is an isomorphism.

Mathematicians often give a pictorial representation of Theorem 10.3, as follows:

![](images/d9405687c4a0ca10b59b01c7eb0ee7658c267ae7150c21471767b999f18ac45a.jpg)

where  $\gamma \colon G \to G / \mathrm{Ker} \phi$  is defined as  $\gamma(g) = g \mathrm{Ker} \phi$ . The mapping  $\gamma$  is called the natural mapping from  $G$  to  $G / \mathrm{Ker} \phi$ . Our proof of Theorem 10.3 shows that  $\psi \gamma = \phi$ . In this case, one says that the preceding diagram is commutative.

As a consequence of Theorem 10.3, we see that all homomorphic images of  $G$  can be determined using  $G$ . We may simply consider the various factor groups of  $G$ . For example, we know that the homomorphic image of an Abelian group is Abelian because the factor group of an Abelian group is Abelian. We know that the number of homomorphic images of a cyclic group  $G$  of order  $n$  is the number of divisors of  $n$ , since there is exactly one subgroup of  $G$  (and therefore one factor group of  $G$ ) for each divisor of  $n$ . (Be careful: The number of homomorphisms of a cyclic group of order  $n$  need not be the same as the number of divisors of  $n$ , since different homomorphisms can have the same image.)

EXAMPLE 15 For every positive integer  $n$  the homomorphisms in Examples 5 and 6 and Theorem 10.3 give us  $Z / \langle n \rangle \approx Z_n$  and  $Z[i] / \{sn + tni \mid s, t \in Z\} \approx Z_n[i]$ .

Theorem 10.3 provides a convenient way to indirectly prove that a factor group  $G / H$  is isomorphic to some group  $\overline{G}$ . Following are some examples.

EXAMPLE 16 Consider the normal subgroup  $SL(2, \mathbf{R}) = \{A \in GL(2, \mathbf{R}) \mid \det A = 1\}$  of  $GL(2, \mathbf{R})$ . Then to prove that  $GL(2, \mathbf{R}) / SL(2, \mathbf{R}) \approx \mathbf{R}^*$  we observe that the mapping  $\phi(A) = \det A$  from  $GL(2, \mathbf{R})$  onto  $\mathbf{R}^*$  is a homomorphism with  $\operatorname{Ker} \phi = SL(2, \mathbf{R})$ .

Likewise, for the normal subgroup  $SL^{\pm}(2,\mathbf{R}) = \{A\in GL(2,\mathbf{R})|$  det  $A = \pm 1\}$  of  $GL(2,\mathbf{R})$  the mapping  $\phi (A) = (\operatorname *{det}A)^2$  from  $GL(2,\mathbf{R})$  onto  $\mathbf{R}^{+}$  is a homomorphism with  $\mathrm{Ker}\phi = SL^{\pm}(2,\mathbf{R})$  . So,  $GL(2,\mathbf{R}) / SL^{\pm}(2,\mathbf{R})\approx \mathbf{R}^{+}$

EXAMPLE 17 For an Abelian group  $G$  and a positive integer  $k$  let  $G^k$  denote the subgroup  $\{x^k \mid x \in G\}$  and  $G^{(k)}$  the subgroup  $\{x \in G \mid x^k = e\}$ . (See Examples 4 and 5 in Chapter 3). Then  $G / G^{(k)} \approx G^k$ . To verify this assertion note that the mapping  $\phi$  from  $G$  onto  $G^k$  given by  $\phi(x) = x^k$  is a homomorphism from  $G$  onto  $G^k$  with  $\operatorname{Ker} \phi = G^{(k)}$ .

The next example of a homomorphism has a beautiful visual description. That it is a homomorphism follows directly from the rules for multiplication of complex numbers written in exponential form. That is,  $z = r e^{i\theta}$ , where  $(a + bi) = z = r(\cos(\theta) + i(\sin(\theta))$ ,  $r = \sqrt{(a^2 + b^2)}$  and  $\theta$  is the angle made by the line in the complex plane from the origin to  $z$ . The multiplication rule is: if  $z = r_1 e^{i\theta}$  and  $w = r_2 e^{i\lambda}$ , then  $zw = r_1 r_2 e^{i(\theta + \lambda)}$ .

# EXAMPLE 18

The mapping from the nonzero complex numbers  $\mathbf{C}^*$  under multiplication to the subgroup  $\{z\in \mathbf{C}^{*}\mid |z| = 1\}$  (the unit circle in the complex plane) that maps  $z$  to the point where the line joining the origin to  $z$  intersects the unit circle is a group homomorphism.

Our next example is a theorem that is used repeatedly in Chapters 23 and 24.

# EXAMPLE 19 (N/C Theorem)

Let  $H$  be a subgroup of a group  $G$ . Noting that the normalizer of  $H$  in  $G$ ,  $N(H) = \{x \in G \mid xHx^{-1} = H\}$ , and the centralizer of  $H$  in  $G$ ,  $C(H) = \{x \in G \mid xhx^{-1} = h \text{ for all } h \text{ in } H\}$ , are subgroups of  $G$ , consider the mapping from  $N(H)$  to  $\operatorname{Aut}(H)$  given by  $g \to \phi_g$ , where  $\phi_g$  is the inner automorphism of  $H$  induced by  $g$  [i.e.,  $\phi_g(h) = ghg^{-1}$  for all  $h \text{ in } H$ ]. This mapping is a homomorphism with kernel  $C(H)$ . So, by Theorem 10.3,  $N(H) / C(H)$  is isomorphic to a subgroup of  $\operatorname{Aut}(H)$ .

As an application of the  $N / C$  Theorem, we will show that every group of order 35 is cyclic. The same proof works for any two primes  $p$  and  $q$  with  $p < q$  where  $p$  does not divide  $q - 1$  (see Exercise 71). For any two primes  $p$  and  $q$  with  $p < q$  where  $p$  does divide  $q - 1$  there is a unique (up to isomorphism) non-Abelian group of order  $pq$ .

# EXAMPLE 20

Let  $G$  be a group of order 35. By Lagrange's Theorem, every nonidentity element of  $G$  has order 5, 7, or 35. If some element has order 35,  $G$  is cyclic. So we may assume that all nonidentity elements have order 5 or 7. However, not all such elements can have order 5, since elements of order 5 come 4 at a time (if  $|x| = 5$ , then  $|x^2| = |x^3| = |x^4| = 5$ ) and 4 does not divide 34. Similarly, since 6 does not divide 34, not all nonidentity elements can have order 7. So,  $G$  has elements of order 7 and order 5. Since  $G$  has an element of order 7, it has a subgroup of order 7. Let us call it  $H$ . In fact,  $H$  is the only subgroup of  $G$  of order 7, for if  $K$  is another subgroup of  $G$  of order 7, we have by Theorem 7.2 that  $|HK| = |H||K| / |H \cap K| = 7 \cdot 7 / 1 = 49$ . But, of course, this is impossible in a group of order 35. Since for every  $a$  in  $G$ ,  $aHa^{-1}$  is also a subgroup of  $G$  of order 7, we must have  $aHa^{-1} = H$ . So,  $N(H) = G$ . Since  $H$  has prime order, it is cyclic and therefore Abelian. In particular,  $C(H)$  contains  $H$ . So, 7 divides  $|C(H)|$  and  $|C(H)|$  divides 35. It follows, then, that  $C(H) = G$  or  $C(H) = H$ . If  $C(H) = G$ , then we may obtain an element  $x$  of order 35 by letting  $x = hk$ , where  $h$  is a nonidentity element of  $H$  and  $k$  has order 5. On the other hand, if  $C(H) = H$ , then  $|C(H)| = 7$  and  $|N(H) / C(H)| = 35 / 7 = 5$ . However, 5 does not divide  $|\operatorname{Aut}(H)| = |\operatorname{Aut}(Z_7)| = 6$ . This contradiction shows that  $G$  is cyclic.

The corollary of Theorem 10.2 says that the kernel of every homomorphism of a group is a normal subgroup of the group. We conclude this chapter by verifying that the converse of this statement is also true.

# Theorem 10.4 Normal Subgroups Are Kernels

Every normal subgroup of a group  $G$  is the kernel of a homomorphism of  $G$ . In particular, a normal subgroup  $N$  is the kernel of the mapping  $g \to gN$  from  $G$  to  $G / N$ .

PROOF Define  $\gamma: G \to G / N$  by  $\gamma(g) = gN$ . (This mapping is called the natural homomorphism from  $G$  to  $G / N$ .) Then,  $\gamma(xy) = (xy)N = xNyN = \gamma(x)\gamma(y)$ . Moreover,  $g \in \operatorname{Ker} \gamma$  if and only if  $gN = \gamma(g) = N$ , which is true if and only if  $g \in N$  (see property 2 of the lemma in Chapter 7).

It is worth emphasizing that there is a homomorphism-normal subgroup duality: Every homomorphism of a group  $G$  results in a normal subgroup  $H$  of  $G$  and every normal subgroup  $H$  of  $G$  results in a natural homomorphism from  $G$  to  $G / H$ .

EXAMPLE 21 In this example we show how to use the normal subgroup  $H$  of  $A_4$  of order 4 given in Example 9 in Chapter 9 and Theorem 10.4 to construct a homomorphism from  $A_4$  onto  $Z_3$ . By Theorem 10.4 the mapping from  $A_4$  onto  $A_4 / H = \{H, (123)H, (123)^2 H\}$  given by  $\alpha \to \alpha H$  is a homomorphism. Since  $A_4 / H$  is isomorphic to  $Z_3$ , it follows that the mapping from  $A_4$  onto  $Z_3$  given by  $H \to 0, (123)H \to 1, (123)^2 H \to 2$  is a homomorphism from  $A_4$  onto  $Z_3$ . (Compare with Exercise 34.)

Many of the previous examples illustrate the utility of the First Isomorphism Theorem. But what about homomorphisms in general? Why would one care to study a homomorphism of a group? The answer is that, just as was the case with factor groups of a group, homomorphic images of a group tell us some of the properties of the original group. One measure of the likeness of a group and its homomorphic image is the size of the kernel. If the kernel of the homomorphism of group  $G$  is the identity, then the image of  $G$  tells us everything (group theoretically) about  $G$  (the two being isomorphic). On the other hand, if the kernel of the homomorphism is  $G$  itself, then the image tells us nothing about  $G$ . Between these two extremes, some information about  $G$  is preserved and some is lost. The utility of a particular homomorphism lies in its ability to preserve the group properties we want, while losing some inessential ones. In this way, we have replaced  $G$  by a group less complicated (and therefore easier to study) than  $G$ ; but, in the process, we have saved enough information to answer questions that we have about  $G$  itself. For example, if  $G$  is a group of order 60 and  $G$  has a homomorphic image of order 12 that is cyclic, then we know from properties 5, 8, and 9 of Theorem 10.2 that  $G$  has normal subgroups of orders 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 60.

The next two examples illustrate how one can use a homomorphism to simplify a problem.

EXAMPLE 22 Suppose we are asked to find an infinite group that is the union of three proper subgroups. Instead of attempting to do this directly, we first make the problem easier by finding a finite group that is the union of three proper subgroups. Since no cyclic group can be the union of proper

subgroups the smallest candidate is a noncyclic group of order 4 group such as  $U(8)$ . Observing that  $U(8)$  is the union of  $H = \{1,3\}$ ,  $K = \{1,5\}$ , and  $L = \{1,7\}$  we have found our finite group. Now all we need do is think of an infinite group that has  $U(8)$  as a homomorphic image and pull back  $H$ ,  $K$ , and  $L$ , and our original problem is solved. Clearly, the mapping from  $U(8) \oplus Z$  onto  $U(8)$  given by  $\phi(a,b) = a$  is such a mapping, and therefore  $U(8) \oplus Z$  is the union of the proper subgroups  $\phi^{-1}(H)$ ,  $\phi^{-1}(K)$  and  $\phi^{-1}(L)$ .

EXAMPLE 23 The groups  $Z \oplus Z$  and  $Z \oplus Z \oplus Z$  are not isomorphic. To verify this suppose that  $\alpha$  is an isomorphism from  $Z \oplus Z$  onto  $Z \oplus Z \oplus Z$ . Let  $\beta$  be the homomorphism from  $Z \oplus Z \oplus Z$  onto  $Z_2 \oplus Z_2 \oplus Z_2$  given by  $\beta(x, y, z) = (x \bmod 2, y \bmod 2, z \bmod 2)$ . Then  $\gamma = \beta \alpha$  is a homomorphism from  $Z \oplus Z$  onto  $Z_2 \oplus Z_2 \oplus Z_2$ . Since  $Z \oplus Z$  is generated by  $(1,0)$  and  $(0,1)$ ,  $Z_2 \oplus Z_2 \oplus Z_2$  is generated by  $\gamma(1,0)$  and  $\gamma(0,1)$ . But any subgroup generated by two elements of  $Z_2 \oplus Z_2 \oplus Z_2$  has order at most 4.

Although an isomorphism is a special case of a homomorphism, the two concepts have entirely different roles. Whereas isomorphisms allow us to look at a group in an alternative way, homomorphisms act as investigative tools. The following analogy between homomorphisms and photography may be instructive.<sup>1</sup> A photograph of a person cannot tell us the person's exact height, weight, or age. Nevertheless, we may be able to decide from a photograph whether the person is tall or short, heavy or thin, old or young, male or female. In the same way, a homomorphic image of a group gives us some information about the group.

In certain branches of group theory, and especially in physics and chemistry, one often wants to know all homomorphic images of a group that are matrix groups over the complex numbers (these are called group representations). Here, we may carry our analogy with photography one step further by saying that this is like wanting photographs of a person from many different angles (front view, profile, head-to-toe view, close-up, etc.), as well as x-rays! Just as this composite information from the photographs reveals much about the person, several homomorphic images of a group reveal much about the group.

# Camille Jordan

Although these contributions [to analysis and topology] would have been enough to rank Jordan very high among his mathematical contemporaries, it is chiefly as an algebraist that he reached celebrity when he was barely thirty; and during the next forty years he was universally regarded as the undisputed master of group theory.

CAMILLE JORDAN was born into a well-todo family on January 5, 1838, in Lyons, France. Like his father, he graduated from the École Polytechnique and became an engineer. Nearly all of his 120 research papers in mathematics were written before his retirement from engineering in 1885. From 1873 until 1912, Jordan taught simultaneously at the École Polytechnique and at the College of France. In the great French tradition, Jordan was a universal mathematician who published in nearly every branch of mathematics. Among the concepts named after him are the Jordan canonical form in matrix theory, the Jordan curve theorem from topology, and the

Jordan-Hölder Theorem from group theory. His classic book Traité des substitutions, published in 1870, was the first to be devoted solely to group theory and its applications to other branches of mathematics. Another book that had great influence and set a new standard for rigor was his Cours d'analyse. This book gave the first clear definitions of the notions of volume and multiple integral. Nearly 100 years after this book appeared, the distinguished mathematician and mathematical historian B. L. van der Waerden wrote, "For me, every single chapter of the Cours d'analyse is a pleasure to read." Jordan died in Paris on January 22, 1922.

# Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups

By a small sample we may judge of the whole piece.

Miguel De Cervantes, Don Quixote

# The Fundamental Theorem

In this chapter we present a theorem that describes to an algebraist's eye (i.e., up to isomorphism) all finite Abelian groups in a standardized way. Before giving the proof, which is long and difficult, we discuss some consequences of the theorem and its proof. The first proof of the theorem was given by Leopold Kronecker in 1858.

# Theorem 11.1 Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups

Every finite Abelian group is a direct product of cyclic groups of prime-power order. Moreover, the number of terms in the product and the orders of the cyclic groups are uniquely determined by the group.

Theorem 11.1 reduces questions about finite abelian groups to questions about cyclic groups, which when combined with the results from earlier chapters, usually yields complete answers to the questions.

Since a cyclic group of order  $n$  is isomorphic to  $Z_{n}$ , Theorem 11.1 shows that every finite Abelian group  $G$  is isomorphic to a group of the form

$$
Z _ {p _ {1} ^ {n _ {1}}} \oplus Z _ {p _ {2} ^ {n _ {2}}} \oplus \dots \oplus Z _ {p _ {k} ^ {n _ {k}}},
$$

where the  $p_i$ 's are not necessarily distinct primes and the prime powers  $p_1^{n_1}, p_2^{n_2}, \ldots, p_k^{n_k}$  are uniquely determined by  $G$ . Writing a group in this form is called determining the isomorphism class of  $G$ .

# The Isomorphism Classes of Abelian Groups

The Fundamental Theorem is extremely powerful. As an application, we can use it as an algorithm for constructing all Abelian groups of any order. Let's look at groups whose orders have the form  $p^k$ , where  $p$  is prime and  $k \leq 4$ . In

general, there is one group of order  $p^k$  for each set of positive integers whose sum is  $k$  (such a set is called a partition of  $k$ ); that is, if  $k$  can be written as

$$
k = n _ {1} + n _ {2} + \dots + n _ {t},
$$

where each  $n_i$  is a positive integer, then

$$
Z _ {p ^ {n _ {1}}} \oplus Z _ {p ^ {n _ {2}}} \oplus \dots \oplus Z _ {p ^ {n _ {t}}}
$$

is an Abelian group of order  $p^k$ .

<table><tr><td>Order of G</td><td>Partitions of k</td><td>Possible direct products for G</td></tr><tr><td>p</td><td>1</td><td>Zp</td></tr><tr><td>p2</td><td>2</td><td>Zp2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>1+1</td><td>Zp ⊕ Zp</td></tr><tr><td>p3</td><td>3</td><td>Zp3</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>2+1</td><td>Zp2 ⊕ Zp</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>1+1+1</td><td>Zp ⊕ Zp ⊕ Zp</td></tr><tr><td>p4</td><td>4</td><td>Zp4</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>3+1</td><td>Zp3 ⊕ Zp</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>2+2</td><td>Zp2 ⊕ Zp2</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>2+1+1</td><td>Zp2 ⊕ Zp ⊕ Zp</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>1+1+1+1</td><td>Zp ⊕ Zp ⊕ Zp ⊕ Zp</td></tr></table>

Furthermore, the uniqueness portion of the Fundamental Theorem guarantees that distinct partitions of  $k$  yield distinct isomorphism classes. Thus, for example,  $Z_{9} \oplus Z_{3}$  is not isomorphic to  $Z_{3} \oplus Z_{3} \oplus Z_{3}$ . A reliable mnemonic for comparing external direct products is the cancellation property: If  $A$  is finite, then

$$
A \oplus B \approx A \oplus C \quad \text {i f a n d o n l y i f} \quad B \approx C.
$$

Thus,  $Z_4 \oplus Z_4$  is not isomorphic to  $Z_4 \oplus Z_2 \oplus Z_2$ , because  $Z_4$  is not isomorphic to  $Z_2 \oplus Z_2$ .

To appreciate fully the potency of the Fundamental Theorem, contrast the ease with which the Abelian groups of order  $p^k$ ,  $k \leq 4$ , were determined with the corresponding problem for non-Abelian groups. Even a description of the two non-Abelian groups of order 8 is a challenge (see Theorem 25.4), and a description of the nine non-Abelian groups of order 16 is well beyond the scope of this text.

Now that we know how to construct all the Abelian groups of prime-power order, we move to the problem of constructing all Abelian groups of a certain order  $n$ , where  $n$  has two or more distinct prime divisors. We begin by writing  $n$  in prime-power decomposition form  $n = p_1^{n_1}p_2^{n_2}\dots p_k^{n_k}$ . Next, we individually form all Abelian groups of order  $p_1^{n_1}$ , then  $p_2^{n_2}$ , and so on, as described earlier. Finally, we form all possible external direct products of these groups. For example, let  $n = 1176 = 2^3\cdot 3\cdot 7^2$ . Then, the complete list

of the distinct isomorphism classes of Abelian groups of order 1176 is

$$
\begin{array}{l} Z _ {8} \oplus Z _ {3} \oplus Z _ {4 9}, \\ Z _ {4} \oplus Z _ {2} \oplus Z _ {3} \oplus Z _ {4 9}, \\ Z _ {2} \oplus Z _ {2} \oplus Z _ {2} \oplus Z _ {3} \oplus Z _ {4 9}, \\ Z _ {8} \oplus Z _ {3} \oplus Z _ {7} \oplus Z _ {7}, \\ Z _ {4} \oplus Z _ {2} \oplus Z _ {3} \oplus Z _ {7} \oplus Z _ {7}, \\ Z _ {2} \oplus Z _ {2} \oplus Z _ {2} \oplus Z _ {3} \oplus Z _ {7} \oplus Z _ {7}. \\ \end{array}
$$

If we are given any particular Abelian group  $G$  of order 1176, the question we want to answer about  $G$  is: Which of the preceding six isomorphism classes represents the structure of  $G$ ? We can answer this question by comparing the orders of the elements of  $G$  with the orders of the elements in the six direct products, since it can be shown that two finite Abelian groups are isomorphic if and only if they have the same number of elements of each order. For instance, we could determine whether  $G$  has any elements of order 8. If so, then  $G$  must be isomorphic to the first or fourth group above, since these are the only ones with elements of order 8. To narrow  $G$  down to a single choice, we now need only check whether or not  $G$  has an element of order 49, since the first product above has such an element, whereas the fourth one does not.

As  $n$  grows, one might wonder how the number of Abelian groups of orders up to  $n$  compares with the total number of groups of order up to  $n$ . In fact, the percentage tends to 0. This is dramatically illustrated by noting that the number of Abelian groups of order  $2^{10} = 1,024$  is 42, whereas the number of groups of order 1,024 is more than 49 billion! In contrast, we remark that as  $n$  tends to infinity, the percentage of the Abelian groups of orders up to  $n$  that are cyclic (those of square-free order) approaches  $6 / \pi^2 \approx 61\%$ .

In contrast, we remark that as  $n$  tends to infinity, the percentage of the Abelian groups of orders up to  $n$  that are cyclic (those of square-free order) approaches  $6 / \pi \approx 61$ .

Despite their relative scarcity among all finite groups up to large orders, finite Abelian groups are of fundamental importance in many branches of mathematics and have many applications.

In the following example the group is small enough that we can easily determine its isomorphism class from the orders of its elements.

EXAMPLE 1 Let  $G = \{1, 8, 12, 14, 18, 21, 27, 31, 34, 38, 44, 47, 51, 53, 57, 64\}$  under multiplication modulo 65. Since  $G$  has order 16, we know it is

isomorphic to one of

$$
\begin{array}{l} Z _ {1 6}, \\ Z _ {8} \oplus Z _ {2}, \\ Z _ {4} \oplus Z _ {4}, \\ Z _ {4} \oplus Z _ {2} \oplus Z _ {2}, \\ Z _ {2} \oplus Z _ {2} \oplus Z _ {2} \oplus Z _ {2}. \\ \end{array}
$$

To decide which one, we can use an online modular arithmetic calculator such as planetcalc.com/8326 to determine the orders of elements of  $G$ .

<table><tr><td>Element</td><td>1</td><td>8</td><td>12</td><td>14</td><td>18</td><td>21</td><td>27</td><td>31</td><td>34</td><td>38</td><td>44</td><td>47</td><td>51</td><td>53</td><td>57</td><td>64</td></tr><tr><td>Order</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>2</td></tr></table>

From the table of orders, we can instantly rule out all but  $Z_{4} \oplus Z_{4}$  and  $Z_{4} \oplus Z_{2} \oplus Z_{2}$  as possibilities. Finally, we observe that since this latter group has a subgroup isomorphic to  $Z_{2} \oplus Z_{2} \oplus Z_{2}$ , it has more than three elements of order 2, and therefore we must have  $G \approx Z_{4} \oplus Z_{4}$ .

Expressing  $G$  as an internal direct product is even easier. Pick an element of maximum order, say the element 8. Then  $\langle 8 \rangle$  is a factor in the product. Next, choose a second element, say  $a$ , so that  $a$  has order 4 and  $\langle a \rangle \cap \langle 8 \rangle = \{1\}$ . Since 12 has this property, we have  $G = \langle 8 \rangle \times \langle 12 \rangle$ .

Example 1 illustrates how quickly and easily one can write an Abelian group as a direct product given the orders of the elements of the group. But calculating all those orders is certainly not an appealing prospect! The good news is that, in practice, a combination of theory and calculation of the orders of a few elements will usually suffice.

EXAMPLE 2 Let  $G = \{1, 8, 17, 19, 26, 28, 37, 44, 46, 53, 62, 64, 71, 73, 82, 89, 91, 98, 107, 109, 116, 118, 127, 134\}$  under multiplication modulo 135. Since  $G$  has order 24, it is isomorphic to one of

$$
\begin{array}{l} Z _ {8} \oplus Z _ {3} \approx Z _ {2 4}, \\ Z _ {4} \oplus Z _ {2} \oplus Z _ {3} \approx Z _ {1 2} \oplus Z _ {2}, \\ Z _ {2} \oplus Z _ {2} \oplus Z _ {2} \oplus Z _ {3} \approx Z _ {6} \oplus Z _ {2} \oplus Z _ {2}. \\ \end{array}
$$

Consider the element 8. Direct calculations show that  $8^4 = 49$ ,  $8^6 = 109$ , and  $8^{12} = 1$ . So  $|8| = 12$ . But now we know  $G$ . Why? Clearly,  $|8| = 12$  rules out the third group in the list. At the same time,  $|109| = 2 = |134|$  (remember,  $134 = -1 \mod 135$ ) implies that  $G$  is not  $Z_{24}$  (see Theorem 4.4). Thus,  $G \approx Z_{12} \oplus Z_2$ , and  $G = \langle 8 \rangle \times \langle 134 \rangle$ .

Rather than express an Abelian group as a direct product of cyclic groups of prime-power orders, it is often more convenient to combine the cyclic factors of relatively prime order, as we did in Example 2, to obtain a direct product of the form  $Z_{n_1} \oplus Z_{n_2} \oplus \dots \oplus Z_{n_k}$ , where  $n_i$  divides  $n_{i-1}$ . For example,  $Z_4 \oplus Z_4 \oplus Z_2 \oplus Z_9 \oplus Z_3 \oplus Z_5$  would be written as  $Z_{180} \oplus Z_{12} \oplus Z_2$  (see Exercise 11).

As a consequence of the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, we have the following corollary, which shows that the converse of Lagrange's Theorem is true for finite Abelian groups.

# Corollary Existence of Subgroups of Abelian Groups

If  $m$  divides the order of a finite Abelian group  $G$ , then  $G$  has a subgroup of order  $m$ .

PROOF Suppose that  $G$  is an Abelian group of order  $n$  and  $m$  divides  $n$ . We induct on the order of  $G$ . The case where  $n$  or  $m$  is 1 is trivial. Let  $p$  be a prime that divides  $m$ . It follows from the corollary of Theorem 11.1 that  $G$  has a subgroup  $H$  of order  $p$ . Then  $G / H$  is an Abelian group of order  $n / p$  and  $m / p$  divides  $|G / H|$ . By the Second Principle of Mathematical Induction,  $\overline{G} = G / H$  has a subgroup  $\overline{K}$  of order  $m / p$ . Since the natural homomorphism  $\phi$  from  $G$  onto  $G / H$  given by  $\phi(g) = gH$  (see Theorem 10.4) is a  $p$  to 1 mapping, every element in  $\overline{K}$  is the image of exactly  $p$  elements in  $G$ . So, the pullback  $\phi(\overline{K})^{-1}$  of  $\overline{K}$  has order  $p(m / p) = m$  and is a subgroup of  $G$ .

It is instructive to verify this corollary for a specific case. Let us say that  $G$  is an Abelian group of order 72 and we wish to produce a subgroup of order 12. According to the Fundamental Theorem,  $G$  is isomorphic to one of the following six groups:

$$
Z _ {8} \oplus Z _ {9}, \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad Z _ {8} \oplus Z _ {3} \oplus Z _ {3},
$$

$$
Z _ {4} \oplus Z _ {2} \oplus Z _ {9}, \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad Z _ {4} \oplus Z _ {2} \oplus Z _ {3} \oplus Z _ {3},
$$

$$
Z _ {2} \oplus Z _ {2} \oplus Z _ {2} \oplus Z _ {9}, \quad Z _ {2} \oplus Z _ {2} \oplus Z _ {2} \oplus Z _ {3} \oplus Z _ {3}.
$$

Obviously,  $Z_8 \oplus Z_9 \approx Z_{72}$  and  $Z_4 \oplus Z_2 \oplus Z_3 \oplus Z_3 \approx Z_{12} \oplus Z_6$  both have a subgroup of order 12. To construct a subgroup of order 12 in  $Z_4 \oplus Z_2 \oplus Z_9$ , we simply piece together all of  $Z_4$  and the subgroup of order 3 in  $Z_9$ ; that is,  $\{(a,0,b) \mid a \in Z_4, b \in \{0,3,6\}\}$ . A subgroup of order 12 in  $Z_8 \oplus Z_3 \oplus Z_3$  is given by  $\{(a,b,0) \mid a \in \{0,2,4,6\}, b \in Z_3\}$ . An analogous procedure applies to the remaining cases and indeed to any finite Abelian group.

Let's turn, now, to the proof of one of the most important theorems in finite group theory. Recall, in Chapter 8 we showed how every group in the family  $U(n)$  is isomorphic to an external direct product of cyclic groups.

# Proof of the Fundamental Theorem

Because of the length and complexity of the proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, we will break it up into a series of lemmas.

# Lemma 1

Let  $G$  be a finite Abelian group of order  $p^n m$ , where  $p$  is a prime that does not divide  $m$ . Then  $G = H \times K$ , where  $H = \{x \in G \mid x^{p^n} = e\}$  and  $K = \{x \in G \mid x^m = e\}$ . Moreover,  $|H| = p^n$ .

PROOF It is an easy exercise to prove that  $H$  and  $K$  are subgroups of  $G$  (see Exercise 51 in Chapter 3). Because  $G$  is Abelian, to prove that  $G = H \times K$  we need only prove that  $G = HK$  and  $H \cap K = \{e\}$ . Since we have  $\gcd(m, p^n) = 1$ , there are integers  $s$  and  $t$  such that  $1 = sm + tp^n$ . For any  $x$  in  $G$ , we have  $x = x^1 = x^{sm + tp^n} = x^{sm}x^{tp^n}$  and, by Corollary 4 of Lagrange's Theorem (Theorem 7.1),  $x^{sm} \in H$  and  $x^{tp^n} \in K$ . Thus,  $G = HK$ . Now suppose that some  $x \in H \cap K$ . Then  $x^{p^n} = e = x^m$  and, by Corollary

2 of Theorem 4.1,  $|x|$  divides both  $p^n$  and  $m$ . Since  $p$  does not divide  $m$ , we have  $|x| = 1$  and, therefore,  $x = e$ .

To prove the second assertion of the lemma, note that  $p^n m = |HK| = |H||K| / |H \cap K| = |H||K|$  (Theorem 7.2). It follows from Theorem 9.5 and Corollary 2 to Theorem 4.1 that  $p$  does not divide  $|K|$  and therefore  $|H| = p^n$ .

Given an Abelian group  $G$  with  $|G| = p_1^{n_1}p_2^{n_2}\dots p_k^{n_k}$ , where the  $p$ 's are distinct primes, we let  $G(p_i)$  denote the set  $\{x\in G\mid x^{p_i^{n_i}} = e\}$ . It then follows immediately from Lemma 1 and induction that  $G = G(p_{1})\times G(p_{2})\times \dots \times G(p_{k})$  and  $|G(p_i)| = p_i^{n_i}$ . Hence, we turn our attention to groups of prime-power order.

# Lemma 2

Let  $G$  be an Abelian group of prime-power order and let  $a$  be an element of maximum order in  $G$ . Then  $G$  can be written in the form  $\langle a \rangle \times K$ .

PROOF We denote  $|G|$  by  $p^n$  and induct on  $n$ . If  $n = 1$ , then  $G = \langle a \rangle \times \langle e \rangle$ . Now assume that the statement is true for all Abelian groups of order  $p^k$ , where  $k < n$ . Among all the elements of  $G$ , choose  $a$  of maximum order  $p^m$ . Then  $x^{p^m} = e$  for all  $x$  in  $G$ . We may assume that  $G \neq \langle a \rangle$ , for otherwise there is nothing to prove. Now, among all the elements of  $G$ , choose  $b$  of smallest order such that  $b \notin \langle a \rangle$ . We claim that  $\langle a \rangle \cap \langle b \rangle = \{e\}$ . Since  $|b^p| = |b| / p$ , we know that  $b^p \in \langle a \rangle$  by the manner in which  $b$  was chosen. Say  $b^p = a^i$ . Notice that  $e = b^{p^m} = (b^p)^{p^{m-1}} = (a^i)^{p^{m-1}}$ , so  $|a^i| \leq p^{m-1}$ . Thus,  $a^i$  is not a generator of  $\langle a \rangle$  and, therefore by Corollary 3 to Theorem 4.2,  $\gcd(p^m, i) \neq 1$ . This proves that  $p$  divides  $i$ , so that we can write  $i = pj$ . Then  $b^p = a^i = a^{pj}$ . Consider the element  $c = a^{-j}b$ . Certainly,  $c$  is not in  $\langle a \rangle$ , for if it were,  $b$  would be, too. Also  $c^p = a^{-jp}b^p = a^{-i}b^p = b^{-p}b^p = e$ . Thus, we have found an element  $c$  of order  $p$  such that  $c \notin \langle a \rangle$ . Since  $b$  was chosen to have smallest order such that  $b \in \langle a \rangle$ , we conclude that  $b$  also has order  $p$ . It now follows that  $\langle a \rangle \cap \langle b \rangle = \{e\}$ , because any nonidentity element of the intersection would generate  $\langle b \rangle$  and thus contradict  $b \notin \langle a \rangle$ .

Now consider the factor group  $\overline{G} = G / \langle b \rangle$ . To simplify the notation, we let  $\overline{x}$  denote the coset  $x\langle b \rangle$  in  $\overline{G}$ . If  $|\overline{a}| < |a| = p^m$ , then  $\overline{a}^{p^{m-1}} = \overline{e}$ . This means that  $(a\langle b \rangle)^{p^{m-1}} = a^{p^{m-1}}\langle b \rangle = \langle b \rangle$ , so that  $a^{p^{m-1}} \in \langle a \rangle \cap \langle b \rangle = \{e\}$ , contradicting the fact that  $|a| = p^m$ . Thus,  $|\overline{a}| = |a| = p^m$ , and therefore  $\overline{a}$  is an element of maximum order in  $\overline{G}$ . By induction, we know that  $\overline{G}$  can be written in the form  $\langle \overline{a} \rangle \times \overline{K}$  for some subgroup  $\overline{K}$  of  $\overline{G}$ . Let  $K$  be the pullback of  $\overline{K}$  under the natural homomorphism from  $G$  to  $\overline{G}$  (i.e.,  $K = \{x \in G \mid \overline{x} \in \overline{K}\}$ ). We claim that  $\langle a \rangle \cap K = \{e\}$ . For if  $x \in \langle a \rangle \cap K$ , then  $\overline{x} \in \langle \overline{a} \rangle \cap \overline{K} = \{\overline{e}\} = \langle b \rangle$  and  $x \in \langle a \rangle \cap \langle b \rangle = \{e\}$ . It now follows from an order argument (see Exercise 37) that  $G = \langle a \rangle K$ , and therefore  $G = \langle a \rangle \times K$ .

Lemma 2 and induction on the order of the group now give the following.

# Lemma 3

A finite Abelian group of prime-power order is an internal direct product of cyclic groups.

Let us pause to determine where we are in our effort to prove the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups. The remark following Lemma 1 shows that  $G = G(p_{1}) \times G(p_{2}) \times \dots \times G(p_{n})$ , where each  $G(p_{i})$  is a group of prime-power order, and Lemma 3 shows that each of these factors is an internal direct product of cyclic groups. Thus, we have proved that  $G$  is an internal direct product of cyclic groups of prime-power order. All that remains to be proved is the uniqueness of the factors. Certainly the groups  $G(p_{i})$  are uniquely determined by  $G$ , since they comprise the elements of  $G$  whose orders are powers of  $p_{i}$ . So we must prove that there is only one way (up to isomorphism and rearrangement of factors) to write each  $G(p_{i})$  as an internal direct product of cyclic groups.

# Lemma 4

Suppose that  $G$  is a finite Abelian group of prime-power order. If  $G = H_1 \times H_2 \times \dots \times H_m$  and  $G = K_1 \times K_2 \times \dots \times K_n$ , where the  $H$ 's and  $K$ 's are nontrivial cyclic subgroups with  $|H_1| \geq |H_2| \geq \dots \geq |H_m|$  and  $|K_1| \geq |K_2| \geq \dots \geq |K_n|$ , then  $m = n$  and  $|H_i| = |K_i|$  for all  $i$ .

PROOF We proceed by induction on  $|G|$ . Clearly, the case where  $|G| = p$  is true. Now suppose that the statement is true for all Abelian groups of order less than  $|G|$ . For any Abelian group  $L$ , the set  $L^p = \{x^p \mid x \in L\}$  is a subgroup of  $L$  (see Example 5 of Chapter 3) and, by Theorem 9.5, is a proper subgroup if  $p$  divides  $|L|$ . It follows that  $G^p = H_1^p \times H_2^p \times \dots \times H_{m'}^p$ , and  $G^p = K_1^p \times K_2^p \times \dots \times K_{n'}^p$ , where  $m'$  is the largest integer  $i$  such that  $|H_i| > p$ , and  $n'$  is the largest integer  $j$  such that  $|K_j| > p$ . (This ensures that our two direct products for  $G^p$  do not have trivial factors.) Since  $|G^p| < |G|$ , we have, by induction,  $m' = n'$  and  $|H_i^p| = |K_i^p|$  for  $i = 1, \ldots, m'$ . Since  $|H_i| = p |H_i|^p$ , this proves that  $|H_i| = |K_i|$  for all  $i = 1, \ldots, m'$ . All that remains to be proved is that the number of  $H_i$  of order  $p$  equals the number of  $K_i$  of order  $p$ ; that is, we must prove that  $m - m' = n - n'$  (since  $n' = M'$ ). This follows directly from the facts that  $|H_1||H_2| \dots |H_{m'}| p^{m - m'} = |G| = |K_1||K_2| \dots |K_{n'}| p^{n - n'}$ ,  $|H_i| = |K_i|$ , and  $m' = n'$ .

Georg Frobenius combined results from the theory of algebraic equations, geometry, and number theory, which led him to the study of abstract groups, the representation theory of groups and the character theory of groups.

GEORG FROBENIUS was born in Berlin Prussia (now Germany) on October 26, 1849. He attended lectures by Kronecker, Kummer, and Weierstrass at the University of Berlin where he received his doctorate (awarded with distinction) in 1870 supervised by Weierstrass. In 1874, after having taught at secondary school level for a short period, he was appointed to the University of Berlin as an extraordinary professor of mathematics. The next year Frobenius received an ordinary professorship at the Eidgenössische Polytechnikum in Zürich, where he stayed for seventeen years. His pioneering work on representation theory for finite groups had important applications in quantum mechanics and theoretical physics.

Frobenius was the first to prove the Cayley-Hamilton theorem and gave the first abstract proof of the famous Sylow Theorem the says if  $p$  is prime and  $p^n$  divides the order of a finite group  $G$ , then  $G$  has a subgroup of order  $p^n$  (his proof is given in Chapter 23)

Frobenius was elected to the Prussian Academy of Sciences in 1892. He supervised 17 PhD students and has over 12,600 academic descendants. Wikipedia lists more than 35 things named after him.

Frobenius died August 3, 1917 in Berlin.

# Introduction to Rings

Example is the school of mankind, and they will learn at no other.

Edmund Burke, On a Regicide Peace

... the source of all great mathematics is the special case, the concrete example. It is frequent in mathematics that every instance of a concept of seemingly great generality is in essence the same as a small and concrete special case.

Paul R. Halmos, I Want to be a Mathematician

In this, and the next several chapters, we look at some of the groups studied thus far from a new prospective.

# Motivation and Definition

Many sets are naturally endowed with two binary operations: addition and multiplication. Examples that quickly come to mind are the integers, the integers modulo  $n$ , the real numbers, matrices, and polynomials. When considering these sets as groups, we simply used addition and ignored multiplication. In many instances, however, one wishes to take into account both addition and multiplication. One abstract concept that does this is the concept of a ring.<sup>1</sup> This notion was originated in the mid-19th century by Richard Dedekind, although its first formal abstract definition was not given until Abraham Fraenkel presented it in 1914.

# Definition Ring

A ring  $R$  is a set with two binary operations, addition (denoted by  $a + b$ ) and multiplication (denoted by  $ab$ ), such that for all  $a, b, c$  in  $R$ :

1.  $a + b = b + a.$  
2.  $(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$ .  
3. There is an additive identity 0. That is, there is an element 0 in  $R$  such that  $a + 0 = a$  for all  $a$  in  $R$ .  
4. There is an element  $-a$  in  $R$  such that  $a + (-a) = 0$ .  
5.  $a(bc) = (ab)c$  
6.  $a(b + c) = ab + ac$  and  $(b + c)a = ba + ca$ .

So, a ring is an Abelian group under addition, also having an associative multiplication that is left and right distributive over addition. Note that

multiplication need not be commutative. When it is, we say that the ring is commutative. Also, a ring need not have an identity under multiplication. A unity (or identity) in a ring is a nonzero element that is an identity under multiplication. A nonzero element of a commutative ring with unity need not have a multiplicative inverse. When it does, we say that it is a unit of the ring. Thus,  $a$  is a unit if  $a^{-1}$  exists.

Because some branches of mathematics always use rings with a unity, some authors require a ring to have a unity and a subring to have the same unity as the whole ring. For a textbook on abstract algebra that greatly reduces the pool of rings and subrings for theorems, examples, and exercises. For example,  $Z$  and  $Z_{n}$  have no proper subrings under that definition and so greatly lessen the parallels between groups and rings.

Here are some words of warning regarding three common mistakes when working with arbitrary rings. Using  $a^0$  or  $a^k$  where  $k$  is a negative integer; assuming  $ab = ba$  for ring elements  $a$  and  $b$ ; assuming that a ring has a unity. Of course, these are valid in some cases.

The following terminology and notation are convenient. If  $a$  and  $b$  belong to a commutative ring  $R$  and  $a$  is nonzero, we say that  $a$  divides  $b$  (or that  $a$  is a factor of  $b$ ) and write  $a \mid b$ , if there exists an element  $c$  in  $R$  such that  $b = ac$ . If  $a$  does not divide  $b$ , we write  $a \nmid b$ .

Recall that if  $a$  is an element from a group under the operation of addition and  $n$  is a positive integer,  $na$  means  $a + a + \dots + a$ , where there are  $n$  summands. When dealing with rings, this notation can cause confusion, since we also use juxtaposition for the ring multiplication. When there is the potential for confusion, we will use  $n \cdot a$  to mean  $a + a + \dots + a$  ( $n$  summands).

For an abstraction to be worthy of study, it must have many diverse concrete realizations. The following list of examples shows that the ring concept is pervasive.

# Examples of Rings

EXAMPLE 1 The set  $Z$  of integers under ordinary addition and multiplication is a commutative ring with unity 1. The units of  $Z$  are 1 and -1.

EXAMPLE 2 The set  $Z_{n} = \{0,1,\ldots ,n - 1\}$  under addition and multiplication modulo  $n$  is a commutative ring with unity 1. The set of units is  $U(n)$ .

EXAMPLE 3 The set  $Z[x]$  of all polynomials in the variable  $x$  with integer coefficients under ordinary addition and multiplication is a commutative ring with unity  $f(x) = 1$ .

EXAMPLE 4 The set  $M_2(Z)$  of  $2 \times 2$  matrices with integer entries is a noncommutative ring with unity  $\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$ . The units of  $M_2(Z)$  are the elements of  $A$  with  $\det A = \pm 1$ . (See Exercise 63.)

EXAMPLE 5 The set  $2Z$  of even integers under ordinary addition and multiplication is a commutative ring without unity.

EXAMPLE 6 The set of all continuous real-valued functions of a real variable whose graphs pass through the point  $(1,0)$  is a commutative ring without unity under the operations of pointwise addition and multiplication [i.e., the operations  $(f + g)(a) = f(a) + g(a)$  and  $(fg)(a) = f(a)g(a)]$ .

EXAMPLE 7 Let  $R_1, R_2, \ldots, R_n$  be rings. We can use these to construct a new ring as follows. Let

$$
R _ {1} \oplus R _ {2} \oplus \dots \oplus R _ {n} = \left\{\left(a _ {1}, a _ {2}, \dots , a _ {n}\right) \mid a _ {i} \in R _ {i} \right\}
$$

and perform componentwise addition and multiplication; that is, define

$$
\left(a _ {1}, a _ {2}, \dots , a _ {n}\right) + \left(b _ {1}, b _ {2}, \dots , b _ {n}\right) = \left(a _ {1} + b _ {1}, a _ {2} + b _ {2}, \dots , a _ {n} + b _ {n}\right)
$$

and

$$
(a _ {1}, a _ {2}, \dots , a _ {n}) (b _ {1}, b _ {2}, \dots , b _ {n}) = (a _ {1} b _ {1}, a _ {2} b _ {2}, \dots , a _ {n} b _ {n}).
$$

This ring is called the direct sum of  $R_{1}, R_{2}, \ldots, R_{n}$ .

The fact that some nonzero elements in a commutative ring with unity do not have multiplicative inverses leads to many oddities when compared other familiar algebraic structures. For instance, in the ring  $Z_6$ , which has unity 1, the subring  $\{0,3\}$  has unity 3, and the subring  $\{0,2,4\}$  has unity 4. (In contrast, the identity in a subgroup is the identity in the group.) Here is another oddity. The polynomial equation  $4x^2 - 4x = 4x(x - 1)$  with coefficients from  $Z_8$ , has eight solutions!

# Properties of Rings

Our first theorem shows how the operations of addition and multiplication intertwine. We use  $b - c$  to denote  $b + (-c)$ .

# Theorem 12.1 Rules of Multiplication

Let  $a, b,$  and  $c$  belong to a ring  $R$ . Then

1.  $a\theta = \theta a = \theta$  
2.  $a(-b) = (-a)b = -(ab)$  
3.  $(-a)(-b) = ab$  
4.  $a(b - c) = ab - ac$  and  $(b - c)a = ba - ca$ .

Furthermore, if  $R$  has a unity element 1, then

5.  $(-1)a = -a$  
6.  $(-1)(-1) = 1$

PROOF We will prove rules 1 and 2 and leave the rest as easy exercises (see Exercise 11). To prove statements such as those in Theorem 12.1, we need only "play off" the distributive property against the fact that  $R$  is a group under addition with additive identity 0. Consider rule 1. Clearly,

$$
0 + a 0 = a 0 = a (0 + 0) = a 0 + a 0.
$$

So, by cancellation,  $0 = a0$ . Similarly,  $0a = 0$

To prove rule 2, we observe that  $a(-b) + ab = a(-b + b) = a0 = 0$ . So, adding  $-(ab)$  to both sides yields  $a(-b) = -(ab)$ . The remainder of rule 2 is done analogously.

Recall that in the case of groups, the identity and inverses are unique. The same is true for rings, provided that these elements exist. The proofs are identical to the ones given for groups and therefore are omitted.

# Theorem 12.2 Uniqueness of the Unity and Inverses

If a ring has a unity, it is unique. If a ring element has a multiplicative inverse, it is unique.

Many students have the mistaken tendency to treat a ring as if it were a group under multiplication. It is not. The two most common errors are the assumptions that ring elements have multiplicative inverses—they need not—and that a ring has a multiplicative identity—it need not. For example, if  $a$ ,  $b$ , and  $c$  belong to a ring,  $a \neq 0$  and  $ab = ac$ , we cannot conclude that  $b = c$ . Similarly, if  $a^2 = a$ , we cannot conclude that  $a = 0$  or 1 (as is the case with real numbers). In the first place, the ring need not have multiplicative cancellation, and in the second place, the ring need not have a multiplicative identity. There is an important class of rings that contains  $Z$  and  $Z[x]$  wherein multiplicative identities exist and for which multiplicative cancellation holds. This class is taken up in the next chapter.

# Subrings

In our study of groups, subgroups played a crucial role. Subrings, the analogous structures in ring theory, play a much less prominent role than their counterparts in group theory. Nevertheless, subrings are important.

# Definition Subring

A subset  $S$  of a ring  $R$  is a subring of  $R$  if  $S$  is itself a ring with the operations of  $R$ .

Just as was the case for subgroups, there is a simple test for subrings.

# Theorem 12.3 Subring Test

A nonempty subset  $S$  of a ring  $R$  is a subring if  $S$  is closed under subtraction and multiplication—that is, if  $a - b$  and  $ab$  are in  $S$  whenever  $a$  and  $b$  are in  $S$ .

PROOF Since addition in  $R$  is commutative and  $S$  is closed under subtraction, we know by the One-Step Subgroup Test (Theorem 3.1) that  $S$  is an Abelian group under addition. Also, since multiplication in  $R$  is associative as well as distributive over addition, the same is true for multiplication in  $S$ . Thus, the only condition remaining to be checked is that multiplication is a binary operation on  $S$ . But this is exactly what closure means.

We leave it to the student to confirm that each of the following examples is a subring.

EXAMPLE 8  $\{0\}$  and  $R$  are subrings of any ring  $R$ .  $\{0\}$  is called the trivial subring of  $R$ .  
EXAMPLE 9  $\{0,2,4,6,8\}$  is a subring of the ring  $Z_{10}$ , the integers modulo 10. Note that 6 is the unity in this subring and 8 is the multiplicative inverse of 2 in this subring.  
EXAMPLE 10 For each positive integer  $n$ , the set

$$
n Z = \{0, \pm n, \pm 2 n, \pm 3 n, \dots \}
$$

is a subring of the integers  $Z$ .

EXAMPLE 11 The set of Gaussian integers

$$
Z [ i ] = \{a + b i \mid a, b \in Z \}
$$

is a subring of the complex numbers  $\mathbf{C}$ .

EXAMPLE 12 Let  $R$  be the ring of all real-valued functions of a single real variable under pointwise addition and multiplication. The subset  $S$  of  $R$  of functions whose graphs pass through the origin forms a subring of  $R$ .

EXAMPLE 13 The set

$$
\left\{\left[ \begin{array}{c c} a & 0 \\ 0 & b \end{array} \right] \bigg | a, b \in Z \right\}
$$

of diagonal matrices is a subring of the ring of all  $2 \times 2$  matrices over  $Z$ .

We can picture the relationship between a ring and its various subrings by way of a subring lattice diagram. In such a diagram, any ring is a subring of all the rings that it is connected to by one or more upward lines. Figure 12.1 shows the relationships among some of the rings we have already discussed.

In the next several chapters, we will see that many of the fundamental concepts of group theory can be naturally extended to rings. In particular, we will introduce ring homomorphisms and factor rings.

I. N. HERSTEIN was born on March 28, 1923, in Poland. His family moved to Canada when he was seven. He grew up in a poor and tough environment, on which he commented that in his neighborhood you became either a gangster or a college professor. During his school years he played football, hockey, golf, tennis, and pool. During this time he worked as a steeplejack and as a barber at a fair. Herstein received a B.S. degree from the University of Manitoba, an M.A. from the University of Toronto, and, in 1948, a Ph.D. degree from Indiana University under the supervision of Max Zorn. Before permanently settling at the University of Chicago in 1962, he held positions at the University of Kansas, the Ohio State University, the

University of Pennsylvania, and Cornell University. Herstein wrote more than 100 research papers and a dozen books. Although his principal interest was noncommutative ring theory, he also wrote papers on finite groups, linear algebra, and mathematical economics. His textbook Topics in Algebra, first published in 1964, dominated the field for 20 years and has become a classic. Herstein had great influence through his teaching and his collaboration with colleagues. He had 29 Ph.D. students, and traveled and lectured widely. His nonmathematical interests included languages and art. He spoke Italian, Hebrew, Polish, and Portuguese. Herstein died on February 9, 1988, after a long battle with cancer.

# Integral Domains

Don't just read it! Ask your own questions, look for your own examples, discover your own proofs. Is the hypothesis necessary? Is the converse true? What happens in the classical special case? Where does the proof use the hypothesis?

Paul Halmos

# Definition and Examples

To a certain degree, the notion of a ring was invented in an attempt to put the algebraic properties of the integers into an abstract setting. A ring is not the appropriate abstraction of the integers, however, because too much is lost in the process. Besides the two obvious properties of commutativity and existence of a unity, there is one other essential feature of the integers that rings in general do not enjoy—the cancellation property. In this chapter, we introduce integral domains—a particular class of rings that have all three of these properties. Integral domains play a prominent role in number theory and algebraic geometry.

# Definition Zero-Divisors

A zero-divisor is a nonzero element  $a$  of a commutative ring  $R$  such that there is a nonzero element  $b \in R$  with  $ab = 0$ .

# Definition Integral Domain

An integral domain is a commutative ring with unity and no zero-divisors.

Thus, in an integral domain, a product is 0 only when one of the factors is 0; that is,  $ab = 0$  only when  $a = 0$  or  $b = 0$ . Put another way: In an integral domain the product of nonzero elements is nonzero.

The following examples show that many familiar rings are integral domains and some familiar rings are not. For each example, the student should verify the assertion made.

EXAMPLE 1 The ring of integers is an integral domain.

EXAMPLE 2 The ring of Gaussian integers  $Z[i] = \{a + bi \mid a, b \in Z\}$  is an integral domain.

EXAMPLE 3 The ring  $Z[x]$  of polynomials with integer coefficients is an integral domain.

EXAMPLE 4 The ring  $Z[\sqrt{2}] = \{a + b\sqrt{2} \mid a, b \in Z\}$  is an integral domain.  
EXAMPLE 5 The ring  $Z_{p}$  of integers modulo a prime  $p$  is an integral domain.  
EXAMPLE 6 The ring  $Z_{n}$  of integers modulo  $n$  is not an integral domain when  $n$  is not prime.  
EXAMPLE 7 The ring  $M_2(Z)$  of  $2 \times 2$  matrices over the integers is not an integral domain.  
EXAMPLE 8  $Z \oplus Z$  is not an integral domain.

What makes integral domains particularly appealing is that they have an important multiplicative group-theoretic property, in spite of the fact that the nonzero elements need not form a group under multiplication. This property is cancellation.

# Theorem 13.1 Cancellation

Let  $a, b$ , and  $c$  belong to an integral domain. If  $a \neq 0$  and  $ab = ac$ , then  $b = c$ .

PROOF From  $ab = ac$ , we have  $a(b - c) = 0$ . Since  $a \neq 0$ , we must have  $b - c = 0$ .

Many authors prefer to define integral domains by the cancellation property—that is, as commutative rings with unity in which the cancellation property holds. This definition is equivalent to ours.

# Fields

In many applications, a particular kind of integral domain called a field is necessary.

# Definition Field

A field is a commutative ring with unity in which every nonzero element is a unit.

To verify that every field is an integral domain, observe that if  $a$  and  $b$  belong to a field with  $a \neq 0$  and  $ab = 0$ , we can multiply both sides of the last expression by  $a^{-1}$  to obtain  $b = 0$ .

It is often helpful to think of  $ab^{-1}$  as  $a$  divided by  $b$ . With this in mind, a field can be thought of as simply an algebraic system that is closed under addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (except by 0). We have had numerous examples of fields: the complex numbers, the real numbers, the rational numbers. The abstract theory of fields was initiated by Heinrich Weber in 1893. Groups, rings, and fields are the three main branches of

abstract algebra. Theorem 13.2 says that, in the finite case, fields and integral domains are the same.

# Theorem 13.2 Finite Integral Domains Are Fields

# A finite integral domain is a field.

PROOF Let  $D$  be a finite integral domain with unity 1. Let  $a$  be any nonzero element of  $D$ . We must show that  $a$  is a unit. If  $a = 1$ ,  $a$  is its own inverse, so we may assume that  $a \neq 1$ . Now consider the following sequence of elements of  $D: a, a^2, a^3, \ldots$ . Since  $D$  is finite, there must be two positive integers  $i$  and  $j$  such that  $i > j$  and  $a^i = a^j$ . Then, by cancellation,  $a^{i-j} = 1$ . Since  $a \neq 1$ , we know that  $i - j > 1$ , and we have shown that  $a^{i-j-1}$  is the inverse of  $a$ .

# Corollary  $Z_{p}$  Is a Field

# For every prime  $p$ ,  $Z_{p}$ , the ring of integers modulo  $p$  is a field.

PROOF According to Theorem 13.2, we need only prove that  $Z_{p}$  has no zero-divisors. So, suppose that  $a, b \in Z_{p}$  and  $ab = 0$ . Then  $ab = pk$  for some integer  $k$ . But then, by Euclid's Lemma (see Chapter 0),  $p$  divides  $a$  or  $p$  divides  $b$ . Thus, in  $Z_{p}, a = 0$  or  $b = 0$ .

Putting the preceding corollary together with Example 6, we see that  $Z_{n}$  is a field if and only if  $n$  is prime. In Chapter 21, we will describe how all finite fields can be constructed. For now, we give one example of a finite field that is not of the form  $Z_{p}$ .

# EXAMPLE 9 Field With Nine Elements

Let  $Z_{3}[i] = \{a + bi \mid a, b \in Z_{3}\} = \{0, 1, 2, i, 1 + i, 2 + i, 2i, 1 + 2i, 2 + 2i\}$ , where  $i^{2} = -1$ . This is the ring of Gaussian integers modulo 3. Elements are added and multiplied as in the complex numbers, except that the coefficients are reduced modulo 3. In particular,  $-1 = 2$ . Table 13.1 is the multiplication table for the nonzero elements of  $Z_{3}[i]$ . Note that because 2 is the only element of order 2,  $Z_{3}[i]^{*}$  is a cyclic group. Moreover, because  $(1 + i)^{2} = 2i$  and  $(2i)^{2} = i^{2} = -1 = 2$ ,  $1 + i$  is a generator of  $Z_{3}[x]^{*}$ .

EXAMPLE 10 Let  $Z_{5}[i] = \{a + bi \mid a, b \in Z_{5}, i^{2} = -1\}$ . This ring has 25 elements but is not an integral domain because  $(1 + 2i)(1 - 2i) = 1 - 4i^{2} = 0$ . (Compare with Exercises 43 and 61.)

EXAMPLE 11 Let  $Q[\sqrt{2}] = \{a + b\sqrt{2} \mid a, b \in Q\}$ . It is easy to see that  $Q[\sqrt{2}]$  is a ring. Viewed as an element of  $\mathbf{R}$ , the multiplicative inverse of any nonzero element of the form  $a + b\sqrt{2}$  is simply  $1 / (a + b\sqrt{2})$ . To verify that  $Q[\sqrt{2}]$  is a field, we must show that  $1 / (a + b\sqrt{2})$  can be written in the form  $c + d\sqrt{2}$ . In high school algebra, this process is called "rationalizing the

denominator." Specifically,

$$
\frac {1}{a + b \sqrt {2}} = \frac {1}{a + b \sqrt {2}} \frac {a - b \sqrt {2}}{a - b \sqrt {2}} = \frac {a}{a ^ {2} - 2 b ^ {2}} - \frac {b}{a ^ {2} - 2 b ^ {2}} \sqrt {2}.
$$

(Note that  $a + b\sqrt{2}\neq 0$  guarantees that  $a - b\sqrt{2}\neq 0.$

# Characteristic of a Ring

Note that for any element  $x$  in  $Z_{3}[i]$ , we have  $3x = x + x + x = 0$ , since addition is done modulo 3. Similarly, in the subring  $\{0, 3, 6, 9\}$  of  $Z_{12}$ , we have  $4x = x + x + x + x = 0$  for all  $x$ . This observation motivates the following definition.

# Definition Characteristic of a Ring

The characteristic of a ring  $R$  is the least positive integer  $n$  such that  $n \cdot x = 0$  for all  $x$  in  $R$ . If no such integer exists, we say that  $R$  has characteristic 0. The characteristic of  $R$  is denoted by char  $R$ .

Thus, the ring of integers has characteristic 0, and  $Z_{n}$  has characteristic  $n$ . An infinite ring can have a nonzero characteristic. Indeed, the ring  $Z_{2}[x]$  of all polynomials with coefficients in  $Z_{2}$  has characteristic 2. (Addition and multiplication are done as for polynomials with ordinary integer coefficients except that the coefficients are reduced modulo 2.) When a ring has a unity, the task of determining the characteristic is simplified by Theorem 13.3.

# Theorem 13.3 Characteristic of a Ring with Unity

Let  $R$  be a ring with unity 1. If 1 has infinite order under addition, then the characteristic of  $R$  is 0. If 1 has order  $n$  under addition, then the characteristic of  $R$  is  $n$ .

PROOF If 1 has infinite order, then there is no positive integer  $n$  such that  $n \cdot 1 = 0$ , so  $R$  has characteristic 0. Now suppose that 1 has additive order  $n$ .

Then  $n \cdot 1 = 0$ , and  $n$  is the least positive integer with this property. So, for any  $x$  in  $R$ , we have

$$
\begin{array}{l} n \cdot x = x + x + \dots + x (n \text {s u m m a n d s}) \\ = 1 x + 1 x + \dots + 1 x (n \text {s u m m a n d s}) \\ = (1 + 1 + \dots + 1) x (n \text {s u m m a n d s}) \\ = (n \cdot 1) x = 0 x = 0. \\ \end{array}
$$

Thus,  $R$  has characteristic  $n$ .

In the case of an integral domain, the possibilities for the characteristic are severely limited.

# Theorem 13.4 Characteristic of an Integral Domain

# The characteristic of an integral domain is 0 or prime.

PROOF By Theorem 13.3, it suffices to show that if the additive order of 1 is finite, it must be prime. Suppose that 1 has order  $n$  and that  $n = st$ , where  $1 \leq s, t \leq n$ . Then, by Exercise 15 in Chapter 12,

$$
0 = n \cdot 1 = (s t) \cdot 1 = (s \cdot 1) (t \cdot 1).
$$

So,  $s \cdot 1 = 0$  or  $t \cdot 1 = 0$ . Since  $n$  is the least positive integer with the property that  $n \cdot 1 = 0$ , we must have  $s = n$  or  $t = n$ . Thus,  $n$  is prime.

An important consequence of Theorem 13.4 is that every finite field has order  $p^n$  where the characteristic of the field is  $p$  (see Exercise 51).

We conclude this chapter with a brief discussion of polynomials with coefficients from a ring—a topic we will consider in detail in later chapters. The existence of zero-divisors in a ring causes unusual results when one is finding zeros of polynomials with coefficients in the ring. Consider, for example, the equation  $x^{2} - 4x + 3 = 0$ . In the integers, we could find all solutions by factoring

$$
x ^ {2} - 4 x + 3 = (x - 3) (x - 1) = 0
$$

and setting each factor equal to 0. But notice that when we say we can find all solutions in this manner, we are using the fact that the only way for a product to equal 0 is for one of the factors to be 0—that is, we are using the fact that  $Z$  is an integral domain. In  $Z_{12}$ , there are many pairs of nonzero elements whose products are  $0: 2 \cdot 6 = 0, 3 \cdot 4 = 0, 4 \cdot 6 = 0, 6 \cdot 8 = 0$ , and so on. So, how do we find all solutions of  $x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0$  in  $Z_{12}$ ? The easiest way is simply to try every element! Upon doing so, we find four solutions:  $x = 1, x = 3, x = 7$ , and  $x = 9$ . Observe that we can find all solutions of  $x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0$  over  $Z_{11}$  or  $Z_{13}$ , say, by setting the two factors  $x - 3$  and  $x - 1$  equal to 0. Of course, the reason this works for these rings is that they are integral domains. Perhaps this will convince you that integral domains are particularly advantageous rings. Table 13.2 gives a summary of some of the rings we have introduced and their properties.

B. L. van der Waerden was born on February 2, 1903, in Amsterdam, Netherlands. He studied mathematics at the University of Amsterdam and the University of Göttingen. At Göttingen, he attended lectures by Emil Artin (see Chapter 15 for a biography) and Emmy Noether (see Chapter 14 for a biography) on the abstract approach to ring theory being pioneered by Noether. The notes he took on these lectures became a two-volume book titled Moderne Algebra published in 1030-1931 that revolutionized the study of algebra that persists to this day.

After nearly 100 years, a translation of his algebra book is still in print. In a review of the book published in 1997 Sauders Mac Lane (see Chapter 16 for a biography) wrote "It [Moderne Algebra] is in my view, the most influential text in algebra of the twentieth century."

Beyond his classic book, van der Waerden made important contributions to the history of mathematics and science, and had more than 2300 academic descendants. van der Waerden died on January 12 1996 at age 92 in Zürich, Switzerland.

# Ideals

Normal subgroups play a special role in group theory—they permit us to construct factor groups. In this chapter, we introduce the analogous concepts for rings—ideals and factor rings.

# Definition Ideal

A subring  $A$  of a ring  $R$  is called a (two-sided) ideal of  $R$  if for every  $r \in R$  and every  $a \in A$  both  $ra$  and  $ar$  are in  $A$ .

So, a subring  $A$  of a ring  $R$  is an ideal of  $R$  if  $A$  "absorbs" elements from  $R$  that is, if  $rA = \{ra \mid a \in A\} \subseteq A$  and  $Ar = \{ar \mid a \in A\} \subseteq A$  for all  $r \in R$ .<sup>1</sup>

An ideal  $A$  of  $R$  is called a proper ideal of  $R$  if  $A$  is a proper subset of  $R$ . In practice, one identifies ideals with the following test, which is an immediate consequence of the definition of ideal and the subring test given in Theorem 12.3.

# Theorem 14.1 Ideal Test

A nonempty subset  $A$  of a ring  $R$  is an ideal of  $R$  if

1.  $a - b \in A$  whenever  $a, b \in A$ .  
2.  $ra$  and  $ar$  are in  $A$  whenever  $a \in A$  and  $r \in R$ .

EXAMPLE 1 For any ring  $R$ ,  $\{0\}$  and  $R$  are ideals of  $R$ . The ideal  $\{0\}$  is called the trivial ideal.

EXAMPLE 2 For any positive integer  $n$ , the set  $nZ = \{0, \pm n, \pm 2n, \ldots\}$  is an ideal of  $Z$ .

EXAMPLE 3 Let  $R$  be a commutative ring with unity and let  $a \in R$ . The set  $\langle a \rangle = \{ ra \mid r \in R \}$  is an ideal of  $R$  called the principal ideal generated by  $a$ . (Notice that  $\langle a \rangle$  is also the notation we used for the cyclic subgroup generated by  $a$ . However, the intended meaning will always be clear from the context.) The assumption that  $R$  is commutative is necessary in this example.

EXAMPLE 4 Let  $\mathbf{R}[x]$  denote the set of all polynomials with real coefficients and let  $A$  denote the subset of all polynomials with constant term 0. Then  $A$  is an ideal of  $\mathbf{R}[x]$  and  $A = \langle x \rangle$ .

EXAMPLE 5 Let  $R$  be a commutative ring with unity and let  $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$  belong to  $R$ . Then  $I = \langle a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \rangle = \{r_1a_1 + r_2a_2 + \dots + r_na_n | r_i \in R\}$  is an ideal of  $R$  called the ideal generated by  $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ . The verification that  $I$  is an ideal is left as an easy exercise (Exercise 3).

The way to think about the ideal in Example 5 is that it is the smallest ideal of  $R$  that contains the elements  $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ .

EXAMPLE 6 Let  $Z[x]$  denote the ring of all polynomials with integer coefficients and let  $I$  be the subset of  $Z[x]$  of all polynomials with even constant terms. Then  $I$  is an ideal of  $Z[x]$  and  $I = \langle x, 2 \rangle$  (see Exercise 51).

EXAMPLE 7 In  $\mathbf{R}[x]$  the set  $S = \{f(x) \in \mathbf{R}[x] \mid f(0)$  is rational\} is a subring but not an ideal of  $\mathbf{R}[x]$ .

# Factor Rings

Let  $R$  be a ring and let  $A$  be an ideal of  $R$ . Since  $R$  is a group under addition and  $A$  is a normal subgroup of  $R$ , we may form the factor group  $R / A = \{r + A \mid r \in R\}$ . The natural question at this point is: How may we form a ring of this group of cosets? The addition is already taken care of, and, by analogy with groups of cosets, we define the product of two cosets of  $s + A$  and  $t + A$  as  $st + A$ . The next theorem shows that this definition works as long as  $A$  is an ideal of  $R$ , and not just a subring of  $R$ .

# Theorem 14.2 Existence of Factor Rings

Let  $R$  be a ring and let  $A$  be a subring of  $R$ . The set of cosets  $\{r + A | r \in R\}$  is a ring under the operations  $(s + A) + (t + A) = s + t + A$  and  $(s + A)(t + A) = st + A$  if and only if  $A$  is an ideal of  $R$ .

PROOF We know that the set of cosets forms a group under addition. Once we know that multiplication is indeed a binary operation on the cosets, it is trivial to check that the multiplication is associative and that multiplication

is distributive over addition. Hence, the proof boils down to showing that multiplication is well-defined if and only if  $A$  is an ideal of  $R$ . To do this, let us suppose that  $A$  is an ideal and let  $s + A = s' + A$  and  $t + A = t' + A$ . Then we must show that  $st + A = s't' + A$ . Well, by definition,  $s = s' + a$  and  $t = t' + b$ , where  $a$  and  $b$  belong to  $A$ . Then

$$
s t = \left(s ^ {\prime} + a\right) \left(t ^ {\prime} + b\right) = s ^ {\prime} t ^ {\prime} + a t ^ {\prime} + s ^ {\prime} b + a b,
$$

and so

$$
s t + A = s ^ {\prime} t ^ {\prime} + a t ^ {\prime} + s ^ {\prime} b + a b + A = s ^ {\prime} t ^ {\prime} + A,
$$

since  $A$  absorbs  $at' + s'b + ab$ . Thus, multiplication is well-defined when  $A$  is an ideal.

On the other hand, suppose that  $A$  is a subring of  $R$  that is not an ideal of  $R$ . Then there exist elements  $a \in A$  and  $r \in R$  such that  $ar \notin A$  or  $ra \notin A$ . For convenience, say  $ar \notin A$ . Consider the elements  $a + A = 0 + A$  and  $r + A = 1$ . Clearly,  $(a + A)(r + A) = ar + A$  but  $(0 + A)(r + A) = 0 \cdot r + A = A$ . Since  $ar + A \neq A$ , the multiplication is not well-defined and the set of cosets is not a ring.

Let's look at a few factor rings.

EXAMPLE 8  $Z / 4Z = \{0 + 4Z, 1 + 4Z, 2 + 4Z, 3 + 4Z\}$ . To see how to add and multiply, consider  $2 + 4Z$  and  $3 + 4Z$ .

$$
(2 + 4 Z) + (3 + 4 Z) = 5 + 4 Z = 1 + 4 + 4 Z = 1 + 4 Z,
$$

$$
(2 + 4 Z) (3 + 4 Z) = 6 + 4 Z = 2 + 4 + 4 Z = 2 + 4 Z.
$$

One can readily see that the two operations are essentially modulo 4 arithmetic.

EXAMPLE 9  $2Z / 6Z = \{0 + 6Z, 2 + 6Z, 4 + 6Z\}$ . Here the operations are essentially modulo 6 arithmetic. For example,  $(4 + 6Z) + (4 + 6Z) = 2 + 6Z$  and  $(4 + 6Z)(4 + 6Z) = 4 + 6Z$ .

Here is a noncommutative example of an ideal and factor ring.

EXAMPLE 10 Let  $R = \left\{\left[ \begin{array}{cc}a_1 & a_2\\ a_3 & a_4 \end{array} \right]\bigg{|}a_i\in Z\right\}$  and let  $I$  be the subset of  $R$  consisting of matrices with even entries. It is easy to show that  $I$  is indeed an ideal of  $R$  (Exercise 25). Consider the factor ring  $R / I$ . The interesting question about this ring is: What is its size? We claim  $R / I$  has 16 elements; in fact,  $R / I = \left\{\left[ \begin{array}{cc}r_{1} & r_{2}\\ r_{3} & r_{4} \end{array} \right] + I\bigg{|}r_{i}\in \{0,1\} \right\}$ . An example illustrates the typical situation. Which of the 16 elements is  $\left[ \begin{array}{cc}7 & 8\\ 5 & -3 \end{array} \right] + I?$  Well, observe that  $\left[ \begin{array}{cc}7 & 8\\ 5 & -3 \end{array} \right] + I = \left[ \begin{array}{cc}1 & 0\\ 1 & 1 \end{array} \right] + \left[ \begin{array}{cc}6 & 8\\ 4 & -4 \end{array} \right] + I = \left[ \begin{array}{cc}1 & 0\\ 1 & 1 \end{array} \right] + I,$  since an ideal absorbs its own elements. In essence, we may replace even entries with 0 and odd entries with 1. The general case is left to the reader (see Exercise 27.)

Example 10 demonstrates how we can use the particular properties of an ideal  $I$  of a ring  $R$  to simplify the form of the elements of the factor ring  $R / I$ . Following are more examples.

EXAMPLE 11 Consider the factor ring  $R = Z_{3}[x] / \langle x^{2} + 1 \rangle$ . To simplify the notation let  $I = \langle x^{2} + 1 \rangle$ . By definition the elements of  $R$  have the form  $f(x) + I$  where  $f(x)$  is a polynomial with coefficients from  $Z_{3}$  but the important question is: What do the distinct cosets of  $R$  look like? The fact that  $x^{2} + 1 + I = 0 + I$  means that when dealing with coset representatives we may treat  $x^{2} + 1$  as equivalent to 0 and therefore  $x^{2} = -1$ . For example, the coset  $2x^{2} + x + 1 + I = -2 + x + 1 + I = x - 1 + I$ . Moreover, when dealing with coset representatives we have  $x^{2} = -1$  implies that  $x^{3} = -x$  and  $x^{4} = 1$ . So,  $x^{4} + 2x^{3} + x^{2} + 2 + I = 1 - 2x - 1 + 2 + I = -2x + 2 + I = x + 2 + I$  (because  $-2 = 1$  in  $Z_{3}$ ). In the same way, we have  $x^{5} = x$ ,  $x^{6} = x^{2}x^{4} = -1$  and so on. Thus we see that  $R = \{ax + b + I \mid a, b \in Z_{3}\}$ . This means that  $R$  has order 9. We can make one more simplification by suppressing the use of  $I$  and just refer to the coset  $ax + b + I$  as  $ax + b$ . All we need to keep in mind is that when we perform the product  $(ax + b)(cx + d) = acx^{2} + (ad + bc)x + bd$  we replace  $acx^{2}$  with  $-ac$ . We can now ask if any particular non-zero element of  $R$  is a unit or a zero-divisor. Consider  $x + 1$ . Note that  $(x + 1)^{2} = x^{2} + 2x + 1 = 2x$ . Then  $(x + 1)^{4} = (2x)^{2} = 4x^{2} = -1$ . So,  $x + 1$  is a unit and  $|x + 1| = 8$ . This means the eight non-zero elements of  $R$  form a cyclic group and  $R$  is a field of order 9.

Just for fun let's look at the factor ring  $R = Z_5[x] / \langle x^2 + 1 \rangle$ .

EXAMPLE 12 Consider the factor ring  $R = Z_5[x] / \langle x^2 + 1 \rangle$ . This time  $|R| = 25$  and  $(x + 1)^4 = (2x)^2 = 4x^2 = -4 = 1$ . So,  $x + 1$  is a unit and  $|x + 1| = 4$ . In contrast,  $(x + 2)(x + 3) = x^2 + 1 = 0$ , So,  $x + 2$  and  $x + 3$  are zero-divisors and  $R$  is not a field.

A simple explanation for the opposite behaviors in the two previous examples is given in Chapter 16.

EXAMPLE 13 Consider the factor ring of the Gaussian integers  $R = Z[i] / \langle 2 - i \rangle$ . As always, we must first determine what the distinct elements of the factor ring look like. This time the elements of  $R$  have the form  $a + bi + \langle 2 - i \rangle$ , where  $a$  and  $b$  are integers, and when dealing with coset representatives, we may treat  $\langle 2 - i \rangle$  as equivalent to 0, so that  $2 = i$ . For example, the coset  $3 + 4i + \langle 2 - i \rangle = 3 + 8 + \langle 2 - i \rangle = 11 + \langle 2 - i \rangle$ . Similarly, all the elements of  $R$  can be written in the form  $a + \langle 2 - i \rangle$ , where  $a$  is an integer. But we can further reduce the set of distinct coset representatives by observing that when dealing with coset representatives,  $2 = i$  implies (by squaring both sides) that  $4 = -1$  or  $5 = 0$ . Thus, the coset  $3 + 4i + \langle 2 - i \rangle = 11 + \langle 2 - i \rangle = 1 + 5 + 5 + \langle 2 - i \rangle = 1 + \langle 2 - i \rangle$ . In this way, we can show that every element of  $R$  is equal to one of the following cosets:  $0 + \langle 2 - i \rangle$ ,  $1 + \langle 2 - i \rangle$ ,  $2 + \langle 2 - i \rangle$ ,  $3 + \langle 2 - i \rangle$ ,  $4 + \langle 2 - i \rangle$ . Is any further reduction possible? To demonstrate that there is not, we will show that these five cosets are distinct. It suffices to show that  $1 + \langle 2 - i \rangle$  has additive order 5. Since  $5(1 + \langle 2 - i \rangle) = 5 + \langle 2 - i \rangle = 0 + \langle 2 - i \rangle$ ,  $1 + \langle 2 - i \rangle$  has order 1 or 5. If the order is actually 1, then  $1 + \langle 2 - i \rangle = 0 + \langle 2 - i \rangle$ , so  $1 \in \langle 2 - i \rangle$ . Thus  $1 = (2 - i)(a + bi) = 2a + b + (-a + 2b)i$  for some integers  $a$  and  $b$ . But this equation implies that  $1 = 2a + b$  and  $0 = -a + 2b$ , and solving these simultaneously yields  $b = 1/5$ , which is a contradiction. It should be clear that the ring  $R$  is essentially the field  $Z_5$  in disguise.

Example 11 illustrates one of the most important applications of factor rings—the construction of rings with highly desirable properties. In particular, we shall show how one may use factor rings to construct integral domains and fields.

# Prime Ideals and Maximal Ideals

# Definitions Prime Ideal, Maximal Ideal

A prime ideal  $A$  of a commutative ring  $R$  is a proper ideal of  $R$  such that  $a, b \in R$  and  $ab \in A$  imply  $a \in A$  or  $b \in A$ . A maximal ideal  $A$  of a commutative ring  $R$  is a proper ideal of  $R$  such that, whenever  $B$  is an ideal of  $R$  and  $A \subseteq B \subseteq R$ , then  $B = A$  or  $B = R$ .

So, the only ideal that properly contains a maximal ideal is the entire ring. The motivation for the definition of a prime ideal comes from the integers.

EXAMPLE 14 Let  $n$  be an integer greater than 1. Then, in the ring of integers, the ideal  $nZ$  is prime if and only if  $n$  is prime (Exercise 13). (\{0\} is also a prime ideal of  $Z$ .)  
EXAMPLE 15 The lattice of ideals of  $Z_{36}$  (Figure 14.1) shows that only  $\langle 2 \rangle$  and  $\langle 3 \rangle$  are maximal ideals.

Figure 14.1 Lattice of ideals of  $Z_{36}$ .

EXAMPLE 16 The ideal  $\langle x^2 + 1 \rangle$  is maximal in  $\mathbf{R}[x]$ . To see this, assume that  $A$  is an ideal of  $\mathbf{R}[x]$  that properly contains  $\langle x^2 + 1 \rangle$ . We will prove that  $A = \mathbf{R}[x]$  by showing that  $A$  contains some nonzero real number  $c$ . [This is the constant polynomial  $h(x) = c$  for all  $x$ .] Then  $1 = (1/c)c \in A$  and therefore, by Exercise 19,  $A = \mathbf{R}[x]$ . To this end, let  $f(x) \in A$ , but  $f(x) \notin \langle x^2 + 1 \rangle$ . Then

$$
f (x) = q (x) \left(x ^ {2} + 1\right) + r (x),
$$

where  $r(x) \neq 0$  and the degree of  $r(x)$  is less than 2. It follows that  $r(x) = ax + b$ , where  $a$  and  $b$  are not both 0, and

$$
a x + b + r (x) = f (x) - q (x) \left(x ^ {2} + 1\right) \in A.
$$

Thus,

$$
a ^ {2} x ^ {2} - b ^ {2} = (a x + b) (a x - b) \in A \quad \text {a n d} \quad a ^ {2} (x ^ {2} + 1) \in A.
$$

So,

$$
0 \neq a ^ {2} + b ^ {2} = (a ^ {2} x ^ {2} + a ^ {2}) - (a ^ {2} x ^ {2} - b ^ {2}) \in A.
$$

EXAMPLE 17 The ideal  $\langle x^2 + 1 \rangle$  is not prime in  $Z_2[x]$ , since it contains  $(x + 1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1 = x^2 + 1$  but does not contain  $x + 1$ .

The next two theorems are useful for determining whether a particular ideal is prime or maximal.

Theorem 14.3  $R / A$  Is an Integral Domain If and Only If  $A$  Is Prime

Let  $R$  be a commutative ring with unity and let  $A$  be an ideal of  $R$ . Then  $R / A$  is an integral domain if and only if  $A$  is prime.

PROOF Suppose that  $R / A$  is an integral domain and  $ab \in A$ . Then  $(a + A)(b + A) = ab + A = A$ , the zero element of the ring  $R / A$ . So, either  $a + A = A$  or  $b + A = A$ ; that is, either  $a \in A$  or  $b \in A$ . Hence,  $A$  is prime.

To prove the other half of the theorem, we first observe that  $R / A$  is a commutative ring with unity for any proper ideal  $A$ . Thus, our task is simply to show that when  $A$  is prime,  $R / A$  has no zero-divisors. So, suppose that  $A$  is prime and  $(a + A)(b + A) = 0 + A = A$ . Then  $ab \in A$  and, therefore,  $a \in A$  or  $b \in A$ . Thus, one of  $a + A$  or  $b + A$  is the zero coset in  $R / A$ .

For maximal ideals, we can do even better.

Theorem 14.4  $R / A$  Is a Field If and Only If  $A$  Is Maximal

Let  $R$  be a commutative ring with unity and let  $A$  be an ideal of  $R$ . Then  $R / A$  is a field if and only if  $A$  is maximal.

PROOF Suppose that  $R / A$  is a field and  $B$  is an ideal of  $R$  that properly contains  $A$ . Let  $b \in B$  but  $b \notin A$ . Then  $b + A$  is a nonzero element of  $R / A$  and, therefore, there exists an element  $c + A$  such that  $(b + A) \cdot (c + A) = 1 + A$ , the multiplicative identity of  $R / A$ . Since  $b \in B$ , we have  $bc \in B$ . Because

$$
1 + A = (b + A) (c + A) = b c + A,
$$

we have  $1 - bc \in A \subset B$ . So,  $1 = (1 - bc) + bc \in B$ . By Exercise 19,  $B = R$ . This proves that  $A$  is maximal.

Now suppose that  $A$  is maximal and let  $b \in R$  but  $b \notin A$ . It suffices to show that  $b + A$  has a multiplicative inverse. (All other properties for a field follow trivially.) Consider  $B = \{br + a \mid r \in R, a \in A\}$ . This is an ideal of  $R$  that properly contains  $A$  (Exercise 37). Since  $A$  is maximal, we must have  $B = R$ . Thus,  $1 \in B$ , say,  $1 = bc + a'$ , where  $a' \in A$ . Then

$$
1 + A = b c + a ^ {\prime} + A = b c + A = (b + A) (c + A).
$$

From Theorems 14.3 and 14.4 and Examples 11 and 12 we see that the ideal  $\langle x^2 + 1 \rangle$  is maximal in  $Z_3[x]$  but not prime in  $Z_5[x]$ .

When a commutative ring has a unity, it follows from Theorems 14.3 and 14.4 that a maximal ideal is a prime ideal. The next example shows that a prime ideal need not be maximal.

EXAMPLE 18 The ideal  $\langle x\rangle$  is a prime ideal in  $Z[x]$  but not a maximal ideal in  $Z[x]$ . To verify this, we begin with the observation that  $\langle x\rangle = \{f(x)\in Z[x]\mid f(0) = 0\}$  (see Exercise 43). Thus, if  $g(x)h(x)\in \langle x\rangle$ , then  $g(0)h(0) = 0$ . And since  $g(0)$  and  $h(0)$  are integers, we have  $g(0) = 0$  or  $h(0) = 0$ .

To see that  $\langle x\rangle$  is not maximal, we simply note that  $\langle x\rangle \subset \langle x,2\rangle \subset Z[x]$  (see Exercise 51).

# Richard Dedekind

RICHARD DEDEKIND was not only a mathematician, but one of the wholly great in the history of mathematics, now and in the past, the last hero of a great epoch, the last pupil of Gauss, for four decades himself a classic, from whose works not only we, but our teachers and the teachers of our teachers, have drawn.

EDMUND LANDAU, Commemorative Address to the Royal Society of Göttingen

RICHARD DEDEKIND was born on October 6, 1831, in Brunswick, Germany, the birthplace of Gauss. Dedekind was the youngest of four children of a law professor. His early interests were in chemistry and physics, but he obtained a doctor's degree in mathematics at the age of 21 under Gauss at the University of Göttingen. Dedekind continued his studies at Göttingen for a few years, and in 1854 he began to lecture there.

Dedekind spent the years 1858-1862 as a professor in Zurich. Then he accepted a position at an institute in Brunswick where he had once been a student.

Although this school was less than university level, Dedekind remained there for the next 50 years. He died in Brunswick in 1916. During his career, Dedekind made numerous fundamental contributions to mathematics. His treatment of irrational numbers, "Dedekind cuts," put analysis on a firm, logical foundation. His work on unique factorization led to the modern theory of algebraic numbers. He was a pioneer in the theory of rings and fields. The notion of ideals as well as the term itself are attributed to Dedekind. Mathematics historian Morris Kline has called him "the effective founder of abstract algebra."

# Emmy Noether

... she discovered methods which have proved of enormous importance in the development of the present-day younger generation of mathematicians.

ALBERT EINSTEIN, The New York Times

EMMY NOETHER was born on March 23, 1882, in Germany. When she entered the University of Erlangen, she was one of only two women among the 1000 students. Noether completed her doctorate in 1907.

In 1916, Noether went to Göttingen and, under the influence of David Hilbert and Felix Klein, became interested in general relativity. While there, she made a major contribution to physics with her theorem that whenever there is a symmetry in nature, there is also a conservation law, and vice versa. In a 2012 issue of the New York Times science writer Ranson Stephens said "You can make a strong case that her theorem is the backbone on which all of modern physics is built." Hilbert tried unsuccessfully to obtain a faculty appointment at Göttingen for Noether, saying, "I do not see that the sex of the candidate is an argument

against her admission as Privatdozent. After all, we are a university and not a bathing establishment."

It was not until she was 38 that Noether's true genius revealed itself. Over the next 13 years, she used an axiomatic method to develop a general theory of ideals and noncommutative algebras. With this abstract theory, Noether was able to weld together many important concepts. Her approach was even more important than the individual results. Hermann Weyl said of Noether, "She originated above all a new and epoch making style of thinking in algebra."

With the rise of Hitler in 1933, Noether, a Jew, fled to the United States and took a position at Bryn Mawr College. She died suddenly on April 14, 1935, following an operation.

# Ring Homomorphisms

If there is one central idea which is common to all aspects of modern algebra it is the notion of homomorphism.

I. N. Herstein, Topics in Algebra

In mathematics, functions are used, among other purposes, (1) to carry out a matching up of elements of one system with those of another; and (2) to transform a given system (or problem) into a simpler one.

Norman J. Block, Abstract Algebra with Applications

# Definitions and Examples

In our work with groups, we saw that one way to discover information about a group is to examine its interaction with other groups by way of homomorphisms. It should not be surprising to learn that this concept extends to rings with equally profitable results.

Just as a group homomorphism preserves the group operation, a ring homomorphism preserves the ring operations.

# Definitions Ring Homomorphism, Ring Isomorphism

A ring homomorphism  $\phi$  from a ring  $R$  to a ring  $S$  is a mapping from  $R$  to  $S$  that preserves the two ring operations; that is, for all  $a, b$  in  $R$ ,

$$
\phi (a + b) = \phi (a) + \phi (b) \qquad \text {a n d} \qquad \phi (a b) = \phi (a) \phi (b).
$$

A ring homomorphism that is both one-to-one and onto is called a ring isomorphism.

As is the case for groups, in the preceding definition the operations on the left of the equal signs are those of  $R$ , whereas the operations on the right of the equal signs are those of  $S$ .

Again as with group theory, the roles of isomorphisms and homomorphisms are entirely distinct. An isomorphism is used to show that two rings are algebraically identical; a homomorphism is used to simplify a ring while retaining certain of its features.

A schematic representation of a ring homomorphism is given in Figure 15.1. The dashed arrows indicate the results of performing the ring operations.

The following examples illustrate ring homomorphisms. The reader should supply the missing details.

Figure 15.1 Actions of a homomorphism.

EXAMPLE 1 For any positive integer  $n$ , the mapping  $k \to k \mod n$  is a ring homomorphism from  $Z$  onto  $Z_{n}$  (see Exercise 9 in Chapter 0). This mapping is called the natural homomorphism from  $Z$  to  $Z_{n}$ .

EXAMPLE 2 The mapping  $a + bi \to a - bi$  is a ring isomorphism from the complex numbers onto the complex numbers (see Exercise 39 in Chapter 6).

EXAMPLE 3 Let  $\mathbf{R}[x]$  denote the ring of all polynomials with real coefficients. The mapping  $f(x)\rightarrow f(1)$  is a ring homomorphism from  $\mathbf{R}[x]$  onto  $\mathbf{R}$ .

EXAMPLE 4 We determine all non-zero ring homomorphisms from  $Z_{10}$  to  $Z_{20}$  and from  $Z_{20}$  to  $Z_{10}$ . From properties of group homomorphisms we know that the image of any ring non-zero homomorphism  $\phi$  from  $Z_{10}$  to  $Z_{20}$  has order 10, 5, or 2. For any ring homomorphism  $\phi$  from a ring  $R$  with unity 1 onto a ring  $S$  and  $\phi(1) = a$  we have that  $1 \cdot 1 = 1$  implies that  $a \cdot a = a$ . That is,  $a$  is an idempotent in  $S$ . If  $|a| = 10$ , from Corollary 4 of Theorem 4.2 we know that  $a = 2$ ,  $2 \cdot 3 = 6$ ,  $2 \cdot 7 = 14$  or  $2 \cdot 9 = 18$ . Checking each case for  $a^2 = a$  we see that none of these four possibilities pans out. If  $|a| = 5$ , then  $a = 4$ , 8, 12, or 16. Of these, only 16 is an idempotent. If  $|a| = 2$ , then  $a = 10$  and but 10 is not an idempotent. So, the only possible non-zero ring homomorphism from  $Z_{10}$  to  $Z_{20}$  is  $\phi(x) = 16x$ . That this is well-defined and preserves both operations follows directly from the definitions.

To determine that ring homomorphisms from  $Z_{20}$  to  $Z_{10}$  we let  $\phi(1) = a$  where  $a$  is an idempotent in  $Z_{10}$ . Checking for idempotents in  $Z_{10}$  we find that they are 5 and 6. Since  $|5| = 2$  and  $|6| = 5$  and both 2 and 10 are divisors of 20 these images are candidates for  $\phi(1)$  and indeed the mappings  $\phi(x) = 5x$  and  $\phi(x) = 6x$  are ring homomorphisms.

EXAMPLE 5 We determine all ring homomorphisms from  $Z_{12}$  to  $Z_{9}$ . We first view  $Z_{12}$  as a cyclic group under addition. Then, we need only determine  $\phi(1)$ . From properties of group homomorphisms, we know that  $|\phi(1)|$  must divide both 12 and 9. So, the only candidates for  $\phi(1)$  viewed under addition are 0, 3, and 6. But neither 3 nor 6 is an idempotent in the ring  $Z_{9}$ . Thus, the zero map is the only ring homomorphism from  $Z_{12}$  to  $Z_{9}$ .

There is an easy way to determine all ring homomorphisms from  $Z_{m}$  to  $Z_{n}$ .

Indeed, the mapping from  $Z_{m}$  to  $Z_{n}$  given by  $x \to kx$  is a ring homomorphism if and only if the order of  $k$  divides both  $m$  and  $n$  and  $k$  is an idempotent in  $Z_{n}$ . See Exercise 9.

EXAMPLE 6 Let  $R$  be a commutative ring of characteristic 2. Then the mapping  $a \to a^2$  is a ring homomorphism from  $R$  to  $R$ .

EXAMPLE 7 Although  $2Z$ , the group of even integers under addition, is group-isomorphic to the group  $Z$  under addition, the ring  $2Z$  is not ring-isomorphic to the ring  $Z$ . (Quick! What does  $Z$  have that  $2Z$  doesn't?)

EXAMPLE 8 The equation  $a^2 - 7b^2 = 3$  has no solution in  $Z$ . Since the mapping  $x \to x \mod 7$  from  $Z$  to  $Z_7$  is a ring homomorphism, any integer solution in the integers would also be a solution in  $Z_7$ . But trying  $a^2 = 3$  for all seven choices for  $a$  does not give a solution.

Our next two examples are applications to number theory of the natural homomorphism given in Example 1.

# EXAMPLE 9 Test for Divisibility by 9

An integer  $n$  with decimal representation  $a_{k}a_{k - 1}\dots a_{0}$  is divisible by 9 if and only if  $a_{k} + a_{k - 1} + \dots +a_{0}$  is divisible by 9. To verify this, observe that  $n = a_k10^k +a_{k - 1}10^{k - 1} + \dots +a_0$ . Then, letting  $\alpha$  denote the natural homomorphism from  $Z$  to  $Z_{9}$  [in particular,  $\alpha (10) = 1$ ], we note that  $n$  is divisible by 9 if and only if

$$
\begin{array}{l} 0 = \alpha (n) = \alpha \left(a _ {k}\right) \left(\alpha (1 0)\right) ^ {k} + \alpha \left(a _ {k - 1}\right) \left(\alpha (1 0)\right) ^ {k - 1} + \dots + \alpha \left(a _ {0}\right) \\ = \alpha \left(a _ {k}\right) + \alpha \left(a _ {k - 1}\right) + \dots + \alpha \left(a _ {0}\right) \\ = \alpha \left(a _ {k} + a _ {k - 1} + \dots + a _ {0}\right). \\ \end{array}
$$

But  $\alpha (a_{k} + a_{k - 1} + \dots +a_{0}) = 0$  is equivalent to  $a_{k} + a_{k - 1} + \dots +a_{0}$  being divisible by 9.

# EXAMPLE 10 Theorem of Gersonides

In 1844 Eugéne Charles Catalan conjectured that  $2^{3}$  and  $3^{2}$  is the only instance of two consecutive powers greater than 1 of natural numbers. That is, they are the only solution in the natural numbers of  $x^{m} - y^{n} = 1$  where  $m, n, x, y > 1$ . This conjecture was proved in 2002 by Preda Mihăilescu. The special case where  $x$  and  $y$  are restricted to 2 and 3 was first proved by the Rabbi Gersonides in the fourteenth century who proved for  $m, n > 1$  the only case when  $2^{m} = 3^{n} \pm 1$  is for  $(m, n) = (3, 2)$ . To verify this is so for  $2^{m} = 3^{n} + 1$ , observe that for all  $n$  we have  $3^{n} \mod 8 = 3$  or 1. Thus,  $3^{n} + 1 \mod 8 = 4$  or 2. On the other hand, for  $m > 2$ , we have  $2^{m} \mod 8 = 0$ . To handle the case where  $2^{m} = 3^{n} - 1$ , we first note that for all  $n$ ,  $3^{n} \mod 16 = 3, 9, 11$ , or 1, depending on the value of  $n \mod 4$ . Thus,  $(3^{n} - 1) \mod 16 = 2, 8, 10$ , or 0. Since  $2^{m} \mod 16 = 0$  for  $m \geq 4$ , we have ruled out the cases where  $n \mod 4 = 1, 2$ , or 3. Because  $3^{4k} \mod 5 = (3^{4})^{k} \mod 5 = 1^{k} \mod 5 = 1$ , we know that  $(3^{4k} - 1) \mod 5 = 0$ . But the only values for  $2^{m} \mod 5$  are 2, 4, 3, and 1. This contradiction completes the proof.

# Theorem 15.1 Properties of Ring Homomorphisms

Let  $\phi$  be a ring homomorphism from a ring  $R$  to a ring  $S$ . Let  $A$  be a subring of  $R$  and let  $B$  be an ideal of  $S$ .

1. For any  $r \in R$  and any positive integer  $n$ ,  $\phi(nr) = n\phi(r)$  and  $\phi(r^n) = (\phi(r))^n$ .  
2.  $\phi (A) = \{\phi (a)\mid a\in A\}$  is a subring of  $S$  
3. If  $A$  is an ideal and  $\phi$  is onto  $S$ , then  $\phi(A)$  is an ideal of  $S$ .  
4.  $\phi^{-1}(B) = \{r\in R\mid \phi (r)\in B\}$  is an ideal of  $R$  
5. If  $R$  is commutative, then  $\phi(R)$  is commutative.  
6. If  $R$  has a unity 1,  $S \neq \{0\}$ , and  $\phi$  is onto, then  $\phi(1)$  is the unity of  $S$  and units in  $R$  map to units in  $S$ .  
7.  $\phi$  is an isomorphism if and only if  $\phi$  is onto and  $\operatorname{Ker} \phi = \{r \in R \mid \phi(r) = 0\} = \{0\}$ .  
8. If  $\phi$  is an isomorphism from  $R$  onto  $S$ , then  $\phi^{-1}$  is an isomorphism from  $S$  onto  $R$ .  
9. If  $a$  is an idempotent in  $R$ , then  $\phi(a)$  is idempotent in  $\phi(R)$ .

PROOF The proofs of these properties are similar to those given in Theorems 10.1 and 10.2 and are left as exercises (Exercise 1).

The student should learn the various properties of Theorem 15.1 in words in addition to the symbols. Property 2 says that the homomorphic image of a subring is a subring. Property 4 says that the pullback of an ideal is an ideal, and so on.

The next three theorems parallel results we had for groups. The proofs are nearly identical to their group theory counterparts and are left as exercises (Exercises 2, 3, and 4).

# Theorem 15.2 Kernels Are Ideals

Let  $\phi$  be a ring homomorphism from a ring  $R$  to a ring  $S$ . Then  $\operatorname{Ker} \phi = \{r \in R \mid \phi(r) = 0\}$  is an ideal of  $R$ .

# Theorem 15.3 First Isomorphism Theorem for Rings

Let  $\phi$  be a ring homomorphism from  $R$  to  $S$ . Then the mapping from  $R / \operatorname{Ker} \phi$  to  $\phi(R)$ , given by  $r + \operatorname{Ker} \phi \to \phi(r)$ , is an isomorphism. In symbols,  $R / \operatorname{Ker} \phi \approx \phi(R)$ .

# Theorem 15.4 Ideals Are Kernels

Every ideal of a ring  $R$  is the kernel of a ring homomorphism of  $R$ . In particular, an ideal  $A$  is the kernel of the mapping  $r \to r + A$  from  $R$  to  $R / A$ .

The homomorphism from  $R$  to  $R / A$  given in Theorem 15.4 is called the natural homomorphism from  $R$  to  $R / A$ . Theorem 15.3 is often referred to as the Fundamental Theorem of Ring Homomorphisms.

In Example 18 in Chapter 14 we gave a direct proof that  $\langle x\rangle$  is a prime ideal of  $Z[x]$  but not a maximal ideal. In the following example we illustrate a better way to do this kind of problem.

EXAMPLE 11 Since the mapping  $\phi$  from  $Z[x]$  onto  $Z$  given by  $\phi(f(x)) = f(0)$  is a ring homomorphism with  $\operatorname{Ker} \phi = \langle x \rangle$  (see Exercise 43 in Chapter 14), we have, by Theorem 15.3,  $Z[x] / \langle x \rangle \approx Z$ . And because  $Z$  is an integral domain but not a field, we know by Theorems 14.3 and 14.4 that the ideal  $\langle x \rangle$  is prime but not maximal in  $Z[x]$ .

# Theorem 15.5 Homomorphism from  $Z$  to a Ring with Unity

Let  $R$  be a ring with unity 1. The mapping  $\phi: Z \to R$  given by  $n \to n \cdot 1$  is a ring homomorphism.

PROOF Since the multiplicative group property  $a^{m + n} = a^m a^n$  translates to  $(m + n)a = ma + na$  when the operation is addition, we have  $\phi(m + n) = (m + n) \cdot 1 = m \cdot 1 + n \cdot 1$ . So,  $\phi$  preserves addition.

That  $\phi$  also preserves multiplication follows from Exercise 15 in Chapter 12, which says that  $(m\cdot a)(n\cdot b) = (mn)\cdot (ab)$  for all integers  $m$  and  $n$ . Thus,  $\phi(mn) = (mn)\cdot 1 = (mn)\cdot ((1)(1)) = (m\cdot 1)(n\cdot 1) = \phi(m)\phi(n)$ . So,  $\phi$  preserves multiplication as well.

# Corollary 1 A Ring with Unity Contains  $Z_{n}$  or  $Z$

If  $R$  is a ring with unity and the characteristic of  $R$  is  $n > 0$ , then  $R$  contains a subring isomorphic to  $Z_{n}$ . If the characteristic of  $R$  is 0, then  $R$  contains a subring isomorphic to  $Z$ .

PROOF Let  $1$  be the unity of  $R$  and let  $S = \{k \cdot 1 \mid k \in Z\}$ . Theorem 15.5 shows that the mapping  $\phi$  from  $Z$  to  $S$  given by  $\phi(k) = k \cdot 1$  is a homomorphism, and by the First Isomorphism Theorem for rings, we have  $Z / \operatorname{Ker} \phi \approx S$ . But, clearly,  $\operatorname{Ker} \phi = \langle n \rangle$ , where  $n$  is the additive order of 1 and, by Theorem 13.3,  $n$  is also the characteristic of  $R$ . So, when  $R$  has characteristic  $n$ ,  $S \approx Z / \langle n \rangle \approx Z_n$ . When  $R$  has characteristic 0,  $S \approx Z / \langle 0 \rangle \approx Z$ .

Here is an example of the mapping in Corollary 1 where the unity of the ring is not immediately obvious.

EXAMPLE 12 Let  $R = \{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\}$  under addition and multiplication modulo 10. Note that 6 is the unity and, because  $5x = 0$  for all  $x$ , the characteristic of  $R$  is 5. So, the mapping  $\phi(n) = n \cdot 6 = 6n$  is an isomorphism with  $\operatorname{Ker} \phi = \langle 5 \rangle$ . Thus  $R \approx Z / \langle 5 \rangle \approx Z_5$  and  $R$  is a field.

# Corollary 2  $Z_{m}$  Is a Homomorphic Image of  $Z$

For any positive integer  $m$ , the mapping of  $\phi \colon Z \to Z_m$  given by  $x \to x \mod m$  is a ring homomorphism.

PROOF This follows directly from the statement of Theorem 15.5, since in the ring  $Z_{m}$ , the integer  $x \mod m$  is  $x \cdot 1$ . (For example, in  $Z_{3}$ , if  $x = 5$ , we have  $5 \cdot 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 2$ .)

# Corollary 3 A Field Contains  $Z_{p}$  or  $Q$  (Steinitz, 1910)

If  $F$  is a field of characteristic  $p$ , then  $F$  contains a subfield isomorphic to  $Z_p$ . If  $F$  is a field of characteristic 0, then  $F$  contains a subfield isomorphic to the rational numbers.

PROOF By Corollary 1,  $F$  contains a subring isomorphic to  $Z_{p}$  if  $F$  has characteristic  $p$ , and  $F$  has a subring  $S$  isomorphic to  $Z$  if  $F$  has characteristic 0. In the latter case, let

$$
T = \{a b ^ {- 1} \mid a, b \in S, b \neq 0 \}.
$$

Then  $T$  is isomorphic to the rationals.

Since the intersection of all subfields of a field is itself a subfield (Exercise 13), every field has a smallest subfield (i.e., a subfield that is contained in every subfield). This subfield is called the prime subfield of the field. It follows from Corollary 3 that the prime subfield of a field of characteristic  $p$  is isomorphic to  $Z_{p}$ , whereas the prime subfield of a field of characteristic 0 is isomorphic to  $Q$ . (See Exercise 75.)

# The Field of Quotients

Although the integral domain  $Z$  is not a field, it is at least contained in a field—the field of rational numbers. And notice that the field of rational numbers is nothing more than quotients of integers. Can we mimic the construction of the rationals from the integers for other integral domains? Yes. The field constructed in Theorem 15.6 is called the field of quotients of  $D$ . Throughout the proof of Theorem 15.6, you should keep in mind that we are

using the construction of the rationals from the integers as a model for our construction of the field of quotients of  $D$ .

# Theorem 15.6 Field of Quotients

Let  $D$  be an integral domain. Then there exists a field  $F$  (called the field of quotients of  $D$ ) that contains a subring isomorphic to  $D$ .

PROOF Let  $S = \{(a, b) \mid a, b \in D, b \neq 0\}$ . We define an equivalence relation on  $S$  by  $(a, b) \equiv (c, d)$  if  $ad = bc$ . Now, let  $F$  be the set of equivalence classes of  $S$  under the relation  $\equiv$  and denote the equivalence class that contains  $(x, y)$  by  $x / y$ . We define addition and multiplication on  $F$  by

$$
a / b + c / d = (a d + b c) / (b d) \quad \text {a n d} \quad a / b \cdot c / d = (a c) / (b d).
$$

(Notice that here we need the fact that  $D$  is an integral domain to ensure that multiplication is closed; that is,  $bd \neq 0$  whenever  $b \neq 0$  and  $d \neq 0$ .)

Since there are many representations of any particular element of  $F$  (just as in the rationals, we have  $1/2 = 3/6 = 4/8$ ), we must show that these two operations are well-defined. To do this, suppose that  $a/b = a'/b'$  and  $c/d = c'/d'$ , so that  $ab' = a'b$  and  $cd' = c'd$ . It then follows that

$$
\begin{array}{l} (a d + b c) b ^ {\prime} d ^ {\prime} = a d b ^ {\prime} d ^ {\prime} + b c b ^ {\prime} d ^ {\prime} = \left(a b ^ {\prime}\right) d d ^ {\prime} + \left(c d ^ {\prime}\right) b b ^ {\prime} \\ = \left(a ^ {\prime} b\right) d d ^ {\prime} + \left(c ^ {\prime} d\right) b b ^ {\prime} = a ^ {\prime} d ^ {\prime} b d + b ^ {\prime} c ^ {\prime} b d \\ = \left(a ^ {\prime} d ^ {\prime} + b ^ {\prime} c ^ {\prime}\right) b d. \\ \end{array}
$$

Thus, by definition, we have

$$
\left. (a d + b c) / (b d) = \left(a ^ {\prime} d ^ {\prime} + b ^ {\prime} c ^ {\prime}\right) / \left(b ^ {\prime} d ^ {\prime}\right), \right.
$$

and, therefore, addition is well-defined. We leave the verification that multiplication is well-defined as an exercise (Exercise 63). That  $F$  is a field is straightforward. Let  $1$  denote the unity of  $D$ . Then  $0/1$  is the additive identity of  $F$ . The additive inverse of  $a/b$  is  $-a/b$ ; the multiplicative inverse of a nonzero element  $a/b$  is  $b/a$ . The remaining field properties can be checked easily.

Finally, the mapping  $\phi \colon D \to F$  given by  $x \to x/1$  is a ring isomorphism from  $D$  to  $\phi(D)$  (see Exercise 7).

EXAMPLE 13 Let  $D = Z[x]$ . Then the field of quotients of  $D$  is  $\{f(x) / g(x) \mid f(x), g(x) \in D$ , where  $g(x)$  is not the zero polynomial\}.

When  $F$  is a field, the field of quotients of  $F[x]$  is traditionally denoted by  $F(x)$ .

EXAMPLE 14 Let  $p$  be a prime. Then  $Z_{p}(x) = \{f(x) / g(x) | f(x), g(x) \in Z_{p}[x], g(x) \neq 0\}$  is an infinite field of characteristic  $p$ .

One point of clarification is warranted here. Whereas in the field of quotients  $F(x)$  the element  $f(x) = x$  has the inverse  $g(x) = 1 / x$ , the  $F$ -valued function  $f(x) = x$  does not have an inverse in any ring of polynomials functions that contains  $F[x]$  since  $1 / x$  it is not defined at  $x = 0$ . Polynomials over a commutative ring  $R$  are abstract objects whereas polynomials that are used to define functions from  $R$  to  $R$  are a particular application of abstract polynomials. We will see in the next chapter that different polynomials can define the same function.

For Artin, to be a mathematician meant to participate in a great common effort, to continue work begun thousands of years ago, to shed new light on old discoveries, to seek new ways to prepare the developments of the future. Whatever standards we use, he was a great mathematician.

RICHARD BRAUER, Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society

EMIL ARTIN was one of the leading mathematicians of the 20th century and a major contributor to linear algebra and abstract algebra. Artin was born on March 3, 1898, in Vienna, Austria, and grew up in what was recently known as Czechoslovakia. He received a Ph.D. in 1921 from the University of Leipzig. From 1923 until he emigrated to America in 1937, he was a professor at the University of Hamburg. After one year at Notre Dame, Artin went to Indiana University. In 1946 he moved to Princeton, where he stayed until 1958. The last four years of his career were spent where it began, at Hamburg. Artin's mathematics is both deep and broad. He made contributions to number theory, group theory, ring theory, field theory, Galois theory, geometric algebra, algebraic topo

logy and the theory of braids—a field he invented. Artin received the American Mathematical Society's Cole Prize in number theory, and he solved one of the 23 famous problems posed by the eminent mathematician David Hilbert in 1900. Artin was an outstanding teacher of mathematics at all levels, from freshman calculus to seminars for colleagues. Many of his Ph.D. students as well as his son Michael have become leading mathematicians. Through his research, teaching, and books, Artin exerted great influence among his contemporaries. He died of a heart attack, at the age of 64, in 1962.

# Polynomial Rings

We lay down a fundamental principle of generalization by abstraction: The existence of analogies between central features of various theories implies the existence of a general theory which underlies the particular theories and unifies them with respect to those central features.

E. H. Moore, (1862-1932)

Wit lies in recognizing the resemblance among things which differ and the difference between things which are alike.

Madame De Stael

# Notation and Terminology

One of the mathematical concepts that students are most familiar with and most comfortable with is that of a polynomial. In high school, students study polynomials with integer coefficients, rational coefficients, real coefficients, and perhaps even complex coefficients. In earlier chapters of this book, we introduced something that was probably new—polynomials with coefficients from  $Z_{n}$ . Notice that all of these sets of polynomials are rings, and, in each case, the set of coefficients is also a ring. In this chapter, we abstract all of these examples into one.

# Definition Ring of Polynomials over  $R$

Let  $R$  be a commutative ring. The set of formal symbols

$$
R [ x ] = \left\{a _ {n} x ^ {n} + a _ {n - 1} x ^ {n - 1} + \dots + a _ {1} x + a _ {0} \mid a _ {i} \in R, \right.
$$

$n$  is a nonnegative integer}

is called the ring of polynomials over  $R$  in the indeterminate  $x$ . Two elements

$$
a _ {n} x ^ {n} + a _ {n - 1} x ^ {n - 1} + \dots + a _ {1} x + a _ {0}
$$

and

$$
b _ {m} x ^ {m} + b _ {m - 1} x ^ {m - 1} + \dots + b _ {1} x + b _ {0}
$$

of  $R[x]$  are considered equal if and only if  $a_{i} = b_{i}$  for all nonnegative integers  $i$ . (Define  $a_{i} = 0$  when  $i > n$  and  $b_{i} = 0$  when  $i > m$ .)

In this definition, the symbols  $x, x^2, \ldots, x^n$  do not represent "unknown" elements or variables from the ring  $R$ . Rather, their purpose is to serve as convenient placeholders that separate the ring elements  $a_n, a_{n-1}, \ldots, a_0$ . We could have avoided the  $x$ 's by defining a polynomial as an infinite sequence  $a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n, 0, 0, 0, \ldots$ , but our method takes advantage of the student's experience in manipulating polynomials where  $x$  does represent a variable. The disadvantage of our method is that one must be careful not to confuse a polynomial with the function determined by a polynomial. For example, in  $Z_3[x]$ , the polynomials  $f(x) = x$  and  $g(x) = x^3$  determine the same function from  $Z_3$  to  $Z_3$ , since  $f(a) = g(a)$  for all  $a$  in  $Z_3$ . But  $f(x)$  and  $g(x)$  are different elements of  $Z_3[x]$ . Also, in the ring  $Z_n[x]$ , be careful to reduce only the coefficients and not the exponents modulo  $n$ . For example, in  $Z_3[x], 5x = 2x$ , but  $x^5 \neq x^2$ .

To make  $R[x]$  into a ring, we define addition and multiplication in the usual way.

# Definition Addition and Multiplication in  $R[x]$

Let  $R$  be a commutative ring and let

$$
f (x) = a _ {n} x ^ {n} + a _ {n - 1} x ^ {n - 1} + \dots + a _ {1} x + a _ {0}
$$

and

$$
g (x) = b _ {m} x ^ {m} + b _ {m - 1} x ^ {m - 1} + \dots + b _ {1} x + b _ {0}
$$

belong to  $R[x]$ . Then

$$
\begin{array}{l} f (x) + g (x) = \left(a _ {s} + b _ {s}\right) x ^ {s} + \left(a _ {s - 1} + b _ {s - 1}\right) x ^ {s - 1} \\ + \dots + (a _ {1} + b _ {1}) x + a _ {0} + b _ {0}, \\ \end{array}
$$

where  $s$  is the maximum of  $m$  and  $n$ ,  $a_{i} = 0$  for  $i > n$ , and  $b_{i} = 0$  for  $i > m$ . Also,

$$
f (x) g (x) = c _ {m + n} x ^ {m + n} + c _ {m + n - 1} x ^ {m + n - 1} + \dots + c _ {1} x + c _ {0},
$$

where

$$
c _ {k} = a _ {k} b _ {0} + a _ {k - 1} b _ {1} + \dots + a _ {1} b _ {k - 1} + a _ {0} b _ {k}
$$

for  $k = 0,\ldots ,m + n$

Although the definition of multiplication might appear complicated, it is just a formalization of the familiar process of using the distributive property and collecting like terms. So, just multiply polynomials over a commutative ring  $R$  in the same way that polynomials are always multiplied. Here is an example.

Consider  $f(x) = 2x^{3} + x^{2} + 2x + 2$  and  $g(x) = 2x^{2} + 2x + 1$  in  $Z_{3}[x]$ . Then, in our preceding notation,  $a_5 = 0, a_4 = 0, a_3 = 2, a_2 = 1, a_1 = 2, a_0 = 2$ , and  $b_5 = 0, b_4 = 0, b_3 = 0, b_2 = 2, b_1 = 2, b_0 = 1$ . Now, using the definitions and remembering that addition and multiplication of the coefficients are done

modulo 3, we have

$$
\begin{array}{l} f (x) + g (x) = (2 + 0) x ^ {3} + (1 + 2) x ^ {2} + (2 + 2) x + (2 + 1) \\ = 2 x ^ {3} + 0 x ^ {2} + 1 x + 0 \\ = 2 x ^ {3} + x \\ \end{array}
$$

and

$$
\begin{array}{l} f (x) \cdot g (x) = (0 \cdot 1 + 0 \cdot 2 + 2 \cdot 2 + 1 \cdot 0 + 2 \cdot 0 + 2 \cdot 0) x ^ {5} \\ + (0 \cdot 1 + 2 \cdot 2 + 1 \cdot 2 + 2 \cdot 0 + 2 \cdot 0) x ^ {4} \\ + (2 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 2 + 2 \cdot 2 + 2 \cdot 0) x ^ {3} \\ + (1 \cdot 1 + 2 \cdot 2 + 2 \cdot 2) x ^ {2} + (2 \cdot 1 + 2 \cdot 2) x + 2 \cdot 1 \\ = x ^ {5} + 0 x ^ {4} + 2 x ^ {3} + 0 x ^ {2} + 0 x + 2 \\ = x ^ {5} + 2 x ^ {3} + 2. \\ \end{array}
$$

Our definitions for addition and multiplication of polynomials were formulated so that they are commutative and associative, and so that multiplication is distributive over addition. We leave the verification that  $R[x]$  is a ring to the reader.

It is time to introduce some terminology for polynomials. If

$$
f (x) = a _ {n} x ^ {n} + a _ {n - 1} x ^ {n - 1} + \dots + a _ {1} x + a _ {0},
$$

where  $a_{n} \neq 0$ , we say that  $f(x)$  has degree  $n$ ; the term  $a_{n}$  is called the leading coefficient of  $f(x)$ , and if the leading coefficient is the multiplicative identity element of  $R$ , we say that  $f(x)$  is a monic polynomial. The polynomial  $f(x) = 0$  has no degree. Polynomials of the form  $f(x) = a_{0}$  are called constant. We often write  $\deg f(x) = n$  to indicate that  $f(x)$  has degree  $n$ . As with polynomials with real coefficients, we may insert or delete terms of the form  $0x^{k}$ ;  $1x^{k}$  is the same as  $x^{k}$ ; and  $+(-a_{k})x^{k}$  is the same as  $-a_{k}x^{k}$ .

Very often properties of  $R$  carry over to  $R[x]$ . Our first theorem is a case in point.

# Theorem 16.1  $D$  an Integral Domain Implies  $D[x]$  an Integral Domain

# If  $D$  is an integral domain, then  $D[x]$  is an integral domain.

PROOF Since we already know that  $D[x]$  is a ring, all we need to show is that  $D[x]$  is commutative with a unity and has no zero-divisors. Clearly,  $D[x]$  is commutative whenever  $D$  is. If 1 is the unity element of  $D$ , it is obvious that  $f(x) = 1$  is the unity element of  $D[x]$ . Finally, suppose that

$$
f (x) = a _ {n} x ^ {n} + a _ {n - 1} x ^ {n - 1} + \dots + a _ {0}
$$

and

$$
g (x) = b _ {m} x ^ {m} + b _ {m - 1} x ^ {m - 1} + \dots + b _ {0},
$$

where  $a_{n} \neq 0$  and  $b_{m} \neq 0$ . Then, by definition,  $f(x)g(x)$  has leading coefficient  $a_{n}b_{m}$  and, since  $D$  is an integral domain,  $a_{n}b_{m} \neq 0$ .

# The Division Algorithm and Consequences

One of the properties of integers that we have used repeatedly is the division algorithm: If  $a$  and  $b$  are integers and  $b \neq 0$ , then there exist unique integers  $q$  and  $r$  such that  $a = bq + r$ , where  $0 \leq r < |b|$ . The next theorem is the analogous statement for polynomials over a field.

# Theorem 16.2 Division Algorithm for  $F[x]$

Let  $F$  be a field and let  $f(x), g(x) \in F[x]$  with  $g(x) \neq 0$ . Then there exist unique polynomials  $q(x)$  and  $r(x)$  in  $F[x]$  such that  $f(x) = g(x)q(x) + r(x)$  and either  $r(x) = 0$  or  $r(x) < \deg g(x)$ .

PROOF We begin by showing the existence of  $q(x)$  and  $r(x)$ . If  $f(x) = 0$  or  $\deg f(x) < \deg g(x)$ , we simply set  $q(x) = 0$  and  $r(x) = f(x)$ . So, we may assume that  $n = \deg f(x) \geq \deg g(x) = m$  and let  $f(x) = a_{n}x^{n} + \dots + a_{0}$  and  $g(x) = b_{m}x^{m} + \dots + b_{0}$ . The idea behind this proof is to begin just as if you were going to "long divide"  $g(x)$  into  $f(x)$ , then use the Second Principle of Mathematical Induction on  $\deg f(x)$  to finish up. Thus, resorting to long division, we let  $f_{1}(x) = f(x) - a_{n}b_{m}^{-1}x^{n - m}g(x)$ . Then,  $f_{1}(x) = 0$  or  $\deg f_{1}(x) < \deg f(x)$ ; so, by our induction hypothesis, there exist  $q_{1}(x)$  and  $r_{1}(x)$  in  $F[x]$  such that  $f_{1}(x) = g(x)q_{1}(x) + r_{1}(x)$ , where  $r_{1}(x) = 0$  or  $\deg r_{1}(x) < \deg g(x)$ .

[Technically, we should get the induction started by proving the case in which  $\deg f(x) = 0$ , but this is trivial.] Thus,

$$
\begin{array}{l} f (x) = a _ {n} b _ {m} ^ {- 1} x ^ {n - m} g (x) + f _ {1} (x) \\ = a _ {n} b _ {m} ^ {- 1} x ^ {n - m} g (x) + q _ {1} (x) g (x) + r _ {1} (x) \\ = \left[ a _ {n} b _ {m} ^ {- 1} x ^ {n - m} + q _ {1} (x) \right] g (x) + r _ {1} (x). \\ \end{array}
$$

So, the polynomials  $q(x) = a_{n}b_{m}^{-1}x^{n - m} + q_{1}(x)$  and  $r(x) = r_1(x)$  have the desired properties.

2For example,

$$
2 x ^ {2} + 2 \frac {(3 / 2) x ^ {2}}{) 3 x ^ {4}} + x + 1
$$

$$
\frac {3 x ^ {4} + 3 x ^ {2}}{- 3 x ^ {2} + x + 1 .}
$$

So,

$$
- 3 x ^ {2} + x + 1 = 3 x ^ {4} + x + 1 - (3 / 2) x ^ {2} (2 x ^ {2} + 2).
$$

In general,

$$
b _ {m} x ^ {m} + \dots \frac {a _ {n} b _ {m} ^ {- 1} x ^ {n - m}}{a _ {n} x ^ {n} + \cdots}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{c} a _ {n} x ^ {n} + \dots \\ \hline f _ {1} (x). \end{array}
$$

So,

$$
f _ {1} (x) = \left(a _ {n} x ^ {n} + \dots\right) - a _ {n} b _ {m} ^ {- 1} x ^ {n - m} \left(b _ {m} x ^ {m} + \dots\right).
$$

To prove uniqueness, suppose that  $f(x) = g(x)q(x) + r(x)$  and  $f(x) = g(x)\bar{q}(x) + \bar{r}(x)$ , where  $r(x) = 0$  or  $\deg r(x) < \deg g(x)$  and  $\bar{r}(x) = 0$  or  $\deg \bar{r}(x) < \deg g(x)$ . Then, subtracting these two equations, we obtain

$$
0 = g (x) [ q (x) - \bar {q} (x) ] + [ r (x) - \bar {r} (x) ]
$$

or

$$
\bar {r} (x) - r (x) = g (x) \left(q (x) - \bar {q} (x)\right).
$$

Thus,  $\bar{r}(x) - r(x)$  is 0, or the degree of  $\bar{r}(x) - r(x)$  is at least that of  $g(x)$ . Since the latter is clearly impossible, we have  $\bar{r}(x) = r(x)$  and  $q(x) = \bar{q}(x)$  as well.

The polynomials  $q(x)$  and  $r(x)$  in the division algorithm are called the quotient and remainder in the division of  $f(x)$  by  $g(x)$ . When the ring of coefficients of a polynomial ring is a field, we can use the long division process to determine the quotient and remainder.

EXAMPLE 1 To find the quotient and remainder upon dividing  $f(x) = 3x^4 + x^3 + 2x^2 + 1$  by  $g(x) = x^2 + 4x + 2$ , where  $f(x)$  and  $g(x)$  belong to  $Z_5[x]$ , we may proceed by long division, provided we keep in mind that addition and multiplication are done modulo 5. Thus,

$$
\begin{array}{l} x ^ {2} + 4 x + 2 \frac {3 x ^ {2} + 4 x}{) 3 x ^ {4} + x ^ {3} + 2 x ^ {2}} + 1 \\ \begin{array}{c c c} 3 x ^ {4} + 2 x ^ {3} + & x ^ {2} \\ \hline 4 x ^ {3} + & x ^ {2} \end{array} \qquad + 1 \\ \begin{array}{c} 4 x ^ {3} + x ^ {2} + 3 x \\ \hline 2 x + 1. \end{array} \\ \end{array}
$$

So,  $3x^{2} + 4x$  is the quotient and  $2x + 1$  is the remainder. Therefore,

$$
3 x ^ {4} + x ^ {3} + 2 x ^ {2} + 1 = (x ^ {2} + 4 x + 2) (3 x ^ {2} + 4 x) + 2 x + 1.
$$

Let  $D$  be an integral domain. If  $f(x)$  and  $g(x) \in D[x]$ , we say that  $g(x)$  divides  $f(x)$  in  $D[x]$  [and write  $g(x) \mid f(x)$ ] if there exists an  $h(x) \in D[x]$  such that  $f(x) = g(x)h(x)$ . In this case, we also call  $g(x)$  a factor of  $f(x)$ . An element  $a$  is a zero (or a root) of a polynomial  $f(x)$  if  $f(a) = 0$ . [Recall that  $f(a)$  means substitute  $a$  for  $x$  in the expression for  $f(x)$ .] When  $F$  is a field,  $a \in F$ , and  $f(x) \in F[x]$ , we say that  $a$  is a zero of multiplicity  $k(k \geq 1)$  if  $(x - a)^k$  is a factor of  $f(x)$  but  $(x - a)^{k+1}$  is not a factor of  $f(x)$ . With these definitions, we may now give several important corollaries of the division algorithm. No doubt you have seen these for the special case where  $F$  is the field of real numbers.

# Corollary 1 Remainder Theorem

Let  $F$  be a field,  $a \in F$ , and  $f(x) \in F[x]$ . Then  $f(a)$  is the remainder in the division of  $f(x)$  by  $x - a$ .

PROOF The proof of Corollary 1 is left as an exercise (Exercise 5).

# Corollary 2 Factor Theorem

Let  $F$  be a field,  $a \in F$ , and  $f(x) \in F[x]$ . Then  $a$  is a zero of  $f(x)$  if and only if  $x - a$  is a factor of  $f(x)$ .

PROOF The proof of Corollary 2 is left as an exercise (Exercise 5).

# Theorem 16.3 Polynomials of Degree  $n$  Have at Most  $n$  Zeros

A polynomial of degree  $n$  over a field has at most  $n$  zeros, counting multiplicity.

PROOF We proceed by induction on  $n$ . Clearly, a polynomial of degree 0 over a field has no zeros. Now suppose that  $f(x)$  is a polynomial of degree  $n$  over a field and  $a$  is a zero of  $f(x)$  of multiplicity  $k$ . Then,  $f(x) = (x - a)^k q(x)$  and  $q(a) \neq 0$ ; and, since  $n = \deg f(x) = \deg (x - a)^k q(x) = k + \deg q(x)$ , we have  $k \leq n$  (see Exercise 19). If  $f(x)$  has no zeros other than  $a$ , we are done. On the other hand, if  $b \neq a$  and  $b$  is a zero of  $f(x)$ , then  $0 = f(b) = (b - a)^k q(b)$ , so that  $b$  is also a zero of  $q(x)$  with the same multiplicity as it has for  $f(x)$  (see Exercise 21). By the Second Principle of Mathematical Induction, we know that  $q(x)$  has at most  $\deg q(x) = n - k$  zeros, counting multiplicity. Thus,  $f(x)$  has at most  $k + n - k = n$  zeros, counting multiplicity.

To demonstrate the unpredictability of the behavior of zeros for polynomials in  $Z_{n}[x]$  when  $n$  is not prime, note that for the polynomial  $f(x) = 50x$  in  $Z_{100}$ , every even integer in  $Z_{100}$  is a zero, and every element in  $Z_{100}$  is a zero of  $f(x) = 50(x - 1)$ . Lagrange was the first to prove Theorem 16.3 for polynomials in  $Z_{p}[x]$ .

# EXAMPLE 2 The Complex Zeros of  $x^n - 1$

We find all complex zeros of  $x^n - 1$ . Let  $\omega = \cos(360^\circ / n) + i\sin(360^\circ / n)$ . It follows from DeMoivre's Theorem (see Example 11 in Chapter 0) that  $\omega^n = 1$  and  $\omega^k \neq 1$  for  $1 \leq k < n$ . Thus, each of  $1, \omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{n-1}$  is a zero of  $x^n - 1$  and, by Theorem 16.4, there are no others.

The complex number  $\omega$  in Example 2 is called a primitive  $n$ th root of unity. We conclude this chapter with an important theoretical application of the division algorithm, but first an important definition.

# Definition Principal Ideal Domain (PID)

A principal ideal domain is an integral domain  $R$  in which every ideal has the form  $\langle a \rangle = \{ra \mid r \in R\}$  for some  $a$  in  $R$ .

# Theorem 16.4  $F[x]$  Is a PID

Let  $F$  be a field. Then  $F[x]$  is a principal ideal domain.

PROOF By Theorem 16.1, we know that  $F[x]$  is an integral domain. Now, let  $I$  be an ideal in  $F[x]$ . If  $I = \{0\}$ , then  $I = \langle 0 \rangle$ . If  $I \neq \{0\}$ , then among all the elements of  $I$ , let  $g(x)$  be one of minimum degree. We will show that  $I = \langle g(x) \rangle$ . Since  $g(x) \in I$ , we have  $\langle g(x) \rangle \subseteq I$ . Now let  $f(x) \in I$ . Then, by the division algorithm, we may write  $f(x) = g(x)q(x) + r(x)$ , where  $r(x) = 0$  or  $\deg r(x) < \deg g(x)$ . Since  $r(x) = f(x) - g(x)q(x) \in I$ , the minimality of  $\deg g(x)$  implies that the latter condition cannot hold. So,  $r(x) = 0$  and, therefore,  $f(x) \in \langle g(x) \rangle$ . This shows that  $I \subseteq \langle g(x) \rangle$ .

Because  $Z[x]$  is an iconic integral domain of polynomials, it is natural to wonder if it is a principal ideal domain. The answer is no. The ideal of all elements in  $Z[x]$  with even constant terms is not generated by a single element. See Exercise 45.

The proof of Theorem 16.4 also establishes the following.

# Theorem 16.5 Criterion for  $I = \langle g(x)\rangle$

Let  $F$  be a field,  $I$  a nonzero ideal in  $F[x]$ , and  $g(x)$  an element of  $F[x]$ . Then,  $I = \langle g(x) \rangle$  if and only if  $g(x)$  is a polynomial of minimum degree in  $I$ .

As an application of the First Isomorphism Theorem for Rings (Theorem 15.3) and Theorem 16.5, we verify the remark we made in Example 12 in Chapter 14 that the ring  $\mathbf{R}[x] / \langle x^2 + 1 \rangle$  is isomorphic to the ring of complex numbers.

EXAMPLE 3 Consider the homomorphism  $\phi$  from  $\mathbf{R}[x]$  onto  $\mathbf{C}$  given by  $f(x)\to f(i)$  (i.e., evaluate a polynomial in  $\mathbf{R}[x]$  at  $i$ ). Then  $x^{2} + 1\in \mathrm{Ker}\phi$  and is clearly a polynomial of minimum degree in  $\mathrm{Ker}\phi$ . Thus,  $\mathrm{Ker}\phi = \langle x^2 +1\rangle$  and  $\mathbf{R}[x] / \langle x^2 +1\rangle$  is isomorphic to  $\mathbf{C}$ .

Citation for the Steele Prize

Saunders Mac Lane ranks among the most influential mathematicians in the 20th century. He was born on August 4, 1909, in Norwich, Connecticut. In 1933, at the height of the Depression, he was newly married; despite having degrees from Yale, the University of Chicago, and the University of Göttingen, he had no prospects for a position at a college or university. After applying for employment as a master at a private preparatory school for boys, Mac Lane received a two-year instructorship at Harvard in 1934. He then spent a year at Cornell and a year at the University of Chicago before returning to Harvard in 1938. In 1947, he went back to Chicago permanently.

# Factorization of Polynomials

Very early in our mathematical education—in fact in junior high school or early in high school itself—we are introduced to polynomials. For a seemingly endless amount of time we are drilled, to the point of utter boredom, in factoring them, multiplying them, dividing them, simplifying them. Facility in factoring a quadratic becomes confused with genuine mathematical talent.

# Reducibility Tests

In high school, students spend much time factoring polynomials and finding their zeros. In this chapter, we consider the same problems in a more abstract setting.

To discuss factorization of polynomials, we must first introduce the polynomial analog of a prime integer.

# Definitions Irreducible Polynomial, Reducible Polynomial

Let  $D$  be an integral domain. A polynomial  $f(x)$  from  $D[x]$  that is neither the zero polynomial nor a unit in  $D[x]$  is said to be irreducible over  $D$  if, whenever  $f(x)$  is expressed as a product  $f(x) = g(x)h(x)$ , with  $g(x)$  and  $h(x)$  from  $D[x]$ , then  $g(x)$  or  $h(x)$  is a unit in  $D[x]$ . A nonzero, nonunit element of  $D[x]$  that is not irreducible over  $D$  is called reducible over  $D$ .

The reason we exclude units in an integral domain  $D[x]$  in a factorization of  $f(x)$  as  $g(x)h(x)$  is that if we did not, then for any unit  $c$  in  $D$ , every  $f(x)$  in  $D[x]$  can be written as  $c^{-1}cf(x)$ , so every nonzero element  $f(x)$  that is not a unit would be reducible over  $D$ , making the concept unuseful.

In the case that an integral domain is a field  $F$ , it is equivalent and more convenient to define a nonconstant  $f(x) \in F[x]$  to be irreducible if  $f(x)$  cannot be expressed as a product of two polynomials of lower degree.

EXAMPLE 1 The polynomial  $f(x) = 2x^{2} + 4$  is irreducible over  $Q$  but reducible over  $Z$ , since  $2x^{2} + 4 = 2(x^{2} + 2)$  and neither 2 nor  $x^{2} + 2$  is a unit in  $Z[x]$ .  
EXAMPLE 2 The polynomial  $f(x) = 2x^{2} + 4$  is irreducible over  $\mathbf{R}$  but reducible over  $\mathbf{C}$ .  
EXAMPLE 3 The polynomial  $x^{2} - 2$  is irreducible over  $Q$  but reducible over  $\mathbf{R}$ .  
EXAMPLE 4 The polynomial  $x^{2} + 1$  is irreducible over  $Z_{3}$  but reducible over  $Z_{5}$  because  $x^{2} + 1 = (x + 2)(x + 3)$  over  $Z_{5}$ .

In general, it is a difficult problem to decide whether or not a particular polynomial is reducible over an integral domain, but there are special cases when it is easy. Our first theorem is a case in point. It applies to the four preceding examples.

# Theorem 17.1 Reducibility Test for Degrees 2 and 3

Let  $F$  be a field. If  $f(x) \in F[x]$  and  $\deg f(x)$  is 2 or 3, then  $f(x)$  is reducible over  $F$  if and only if  $f(x)$  has a zero in  $F$ .

PROOF Suppose that  $f(x) = g(x)h(x)$ , where both  $g(x)$  and  $h(x)$  belong to  $F[x]$  and have degrees less than that of  $f(x)$ . Since  $\deg f(x) = \deg g(x) + \deg h(x)$  (Exercise 19 in Chapter 16) and  $\deg f(x)$  is 2 or 3, at least one of  $g(x)$  and  $h(x)$  has degree 1. Say  $g(x) = ax + b$ . Then, clearly,  $-a^{-1}b$  is a zero of  $g(x)$  and therefore a zero of  $f(x)$  as well.

Conversely, suppose that  $f(a) = 0$ , where  $a \in F$ . Then, by the Factor Theorem, we know that  $x - a$  is a factor of  $f(x)$  and, therefore,  $f(x)$  is reducible over  $F$ .

Theorem 17.1 is particularly easy to use when the field is  $Z_{p}$ , because in this case we can check for reducibility of  $f(x)$  by simply testing to see if  $f(a) = 0$  for  $a = 0, 1, \ldots, p - 1$ . For example, since 2 is a zero of  $x^{2} + 1$  over  $Z_{5}$ ,  $x^{2} + 1$  is reducible over  $Z_{5}$ . On the other hand, because neither 0, 1, nor 2 is a zero of  $x^{2} + 1$  over  $Z_{3}$ ,  $x^{2} + 1$  is irreducible over  $Z_{3}$ .

Note that polynomials of degree larger than 3 may be reducible over a field even though they do not have zeros in the field. For example, in  $Q[x]$ , the polynomial  $x^4 + 2x^2 + 1$  is equal to  $(x^2 + 1)^2$ , but has no zeros in  $Q$ .

Our next three results deal with polynomials with integer coefficients. To simplify the proof of the first of these, we introduce some terminology and isolate a portion of the argument in the form of a lemma.

# Definitions Content of a Polynomial, Primitive Polynomial

The content of a nonzero polynomial  $a_{n}x^{n} + a_{n - 1}x^{n - 1} + \dots +a_{0}$  where the  $a$  's are integers, is the greatest common divisor of the integers  $a_{n},a_{n - 1},\ldots ,a_{0}$ . A primitive polynomial is an element of  $Z[x]$  with content 1.

# Gauss's Lemma

# The product of two primitive polynomials is primitive.

PROOF Let  $f(x)$  and  $g(x)$  be primitive polynomials, and suppose that  $f(x)g(x)$  is not primitive. Let  $p$  be a prime divisor of the content of  $f(x)g(x)$ , and let  $\bar{f}(x), \bar{g}(x)$ , and  $\overline{f(x)g(x)}$  be the polynomials obtained from  $f(x), g(x)$ , and  $f(x)g(x)$  by reducing the coefficients modulo  $p$ . Then,  $\bar{f}(x)$  and  $\bar{g}(x)$  belong to the integral domain  $Z_p[x]$  and  $\bar{f}(x)\bar{g}(x) = \overline{f(x)g(x)} = 0$ , the zero element of  $Z_p[x]$ . Thus,  $\bar{f}(x) = 0$  or  $\bar{g}(x) = 0$ . This means that either  $p$  divides every coefficient of  $f(x)$  or  $p$  divides every coefficient of  $g(x)$ . Hence, either  $f(x)$  is not primitive or  $g(x)$  is not primitive. This contradiction completes the proof.

Remember that the question of reducibility depends on which ring of coefficients one permits. Thus,  $x^{2} - 2$  is irreducible over  $Z$  but reducible over  $Q[\sqrt{2}]$ . In Chapter 19, we will prove that every polynomial of degree greater than 1 with coefficients from an integral domain is reducible over some field. Theorem 17.2 shows that in the case of polynomials irreducible over  $Z$ , this field must be larger than the field of rational numbers.

# Theorem 17.2 Reducibility over  $Q$  implies Reducibility over  $Z$

Let  $f(x) \in Z[x]$ . If  $f(x)$  is reducible over  $Q$ , then it is reducible over  $Z$ .

PROOF Suppose that  $f(x) = g(x)h(x)$ , where  $g(x)$  and  $h(x) \in Q[x]$ . Clearly, we may assume that  $f(x)$  is primitive because we can divide both  $f(x)$  and  $g(x)$  by the content of  $f(x)$ . Let  $a$  be the least common multiple of the denominators of the coefficients of  $g(x)$ , and  $b$  the least common multiple of the denominators of the coefficients of  $h(x)$ . Then  $abf(x) = ag(x) \cdot bh(x)$ , where  $ag(x)$  and  $bh(x) \in Z[x]$ . Let  $c_{1}$  be the content of  $ag(x)$  and let  $c_{2}$  be the content of  $bh(x)$ . Then  $ag(x) = c_{1}g_{1}(x)$  and  $bh(x) = c_{2}h_{1}(x)$ , where both  $g_{1}(x)$  and  $h_{1}(x)$  are primitive, and  $abf(x) = c_{1}c_{2}g_{1}(x)h_{1}(x)$ . Since  $f(x)$  is primitive, the content of  $abf(x)$  is  $ab$ . Also, since the product of two primitive polynomials is primitive, it follows that the content of  $c_{1}c_{2}g_{1}(x)h_{1}(x)$  is  $c_{1}c_{2}$ . Thus,  $ab = c_{1}c_{2}$  and  $f(x) = g_{1}(x)h_{1}(x)$ , where  $g_{1}(x)$  and  $h_{1}(x) \in Z[x]$  and  $\deg g_{1}(x) = \deg g(x)$  and  $\deg h_{1}(x) = \deg h(x)$ .

EXAMPLE 5 We illustrate the proof of Theorem 17.2 by tracing through it for the polynomial  $f(x) = 6x^{2} + x - 2 = (3x - 3/2)(2x + 4/3) = g(x)h(x)$ . In this case we have  $a = 2, b = 3, c_{1} = 3, c_{2} = 2, g_{1}(x) = 2x - 1$ , and  $h_{1}(x) = 3x + 2$ , so that  $2 \cdot 3(6x^{2} + x - 2) = 3 \cdot 2(2x - 1)(3x + 2)$  or  $6x^{2} + x - 2 = (2x - 1)(3x + 2)$ .

# Irreducibility Tests

Theorem 17.1 reduces the question of irreducibility of a polynomial of degree 2 or 3 to one of finding a zero. The next theorem often allows us to simplify the problem even further.

# Theorem 17.3 Mod  $p$  Irreducibility Test

Let  $f(x) \in Z[x]$  with  $\deg f(x) > 1$  and let  $p$  be a prime that does not divide the lead coefficient of  $f(x)$  nor the constant term of  $f(x)$ . Let  $\bar{f}(x)$  be the polynomial in  $Z_p[x]$  obtained from  $f(x)$  by reducing all the coefficients of  $f(x)$  modulo  $p$ . If  $\bar{f}(x)$  is irreducible over  $Z_p$ , then  $f(x)$  is irreducible over  $Q$ .

PROOF It follows from the proof of Theorem 17.2 that if  $f(x)$  is reducible over  $Q$ , then  $f(x) = g(x)h(x)$  with  $g(x), h(x) \in Z[x]$ , and both  $g(x)$  and  $h(x)$  have degree less than that of  $f(x)$ . Let  $\bar{f}(x), \bar{g}(x)$ , and  $\bar{h}(x)$  be the polynomials obtained from  $f(x), g(x)$ , and  $h(x)$  by reducing all the coefficients modulo  $p$ . Since  $\deg f(x) = \deg \bar{f}(x)$ , we have  $\deg \bar{g}(x) \leq \deg g(x) < \deg \bar{f}(x)$  and  $\deg \bar{h}(x) \leq \deg h(x) < \deg \bar{f}(x)$ . But,  $\bar{f}(x) = \bar{g}(x)\bar{h}(x)$ , and this contradicts our assumption that  $\bar{f}(x)$  is irreducible over  $Z_p$ .

To see why the Mod  $p$  Irreducibility Test requires that the lead coefficient of  $f(x)$  not be divisible by  $p$ , note the reducible polynomial  $(3x + 1)(x^2 + 1)$  in  $Z[x]$  becomes the irreducible polynomial  $x^2 + 1$  over  $Z_3$ . The Mod  $p$  Irreducibility Test never works when a prime  $p$  divides the constant term of an  $f(x) \in Z[x]$  because  $\overline{f}(x)$  has  $x$  as a factor.

EXAMPLE 6 Consider  $f(x) = 5x^{3} + 7x + 6$ . Then the smallest prime  $p$  for which we may apply the Mod  $p$  Irreducibility Test is 7. By Theorem 17.1, it suffices to show that  $\overline{f}(x) = 5x^{3} + 6 = -2x^{3} - 1$  has no zeros in  $Z_{7}$  (we include the last expression to make the arithmetic easier). Checking this for a zero reveals that there are no zeros. So,  $f(x)$  is irreducible over  $Q$ .

Notice that the larger the prime  $p$ , the greater the number of cases that must be checked.

EXAMPLE 7 Let  $f(x) = 21x^{3} - 3x^{2} + 2x + 9$ . Then, over  $Z_{2}$ , we have  $\bar{f}(x) = x^{3} + x^{2} + 1$  and, since  $\bar{f}(0) = 1$  and  $\bar{f}(1) = 1$ , we see that  $\bar{f}(x)$  is irreducible over  $Z_{2}$ . Thus,  $f(x)$  is irreducible over  $Q$ . Notice that, over  $Z_{3}$ ,  $\bar{f}(x) = 2x$  is irreducible, but we may not apply Theorem 17.3 to conclude that  $f(x)$  is irreducible over  $Q$ .

Be careful not to use the converse of Theorem 17.3. If  $f(x) \in Z[x]$  and  $\bar{f}(x)$  is reducible over  $Z_p$  for some  $p$ ,  $f(x)$  may still be irreducible over  $Q$ . For example, consider  $f(x) = 21x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x + 8$ . Then, over  $Z_2$ ,  $\bar{f}(x) = x^3 + x^2 = x^2(x + 1)$ . This is a false positive because over  $Z_5$ ,  $\bar{f}(x)$  has no zeros and therefore is irreducible over  $Z_5$ . So,  $f(x)$  is irreducible over  $Q$ . Note that this example shows that the Mod  $p$  Irreducibility Test may fail for some  $p$

and work for others. To conclude that a particular  $f(x)$  in  $Z[x]$  is irreducible over  $Q$ , all we need to do is find a single  $p$  for which the corresponding polynomial  $\bar{f}(x)$  in  $Z_p$  is irreducible. However, this is not always possible, since  $f(x) = x^4 + 1$  is irreducible over  $Q$  but reducible over  $Z_p$  for every prime  $p$ .

The Mod  $p$  Irreducibility Test can also be helpful in checking for irreducibility of polynomials of degree greater than 3 and polynomials with rational coefficients.

EXAMPLE 8 Let  $f(x) = (3/7)x^4 - (2/7)x^2 + (9/35)x + 3/5$ . We will show that  $f(x)$  is irreducible over  $Q$ . First, let  $h(x) = 35f(x) = 15x^4 - 10x^2 + 9x + 21$ . Then  $f(x)$  is irreducible over  $Q$  if  $h(x)$  is irreducible over  $Z$ . Next, applying the Mod 2 Irreducibility Test to  $h(x)$ , we get  $\bar{h}(x) = x^4 + x + 1$ . Clearly,  $\bar{h}(x)$  has no zeros in  $Z_2$ . Furthermore,  $\bar{h}(x)$  has no quadratic factor in  $Z_2[x]$  either. [For if so, the factor would have to be either  $x^2 + x + 1$  or  $x^2 + 1$ . Long division shows that  $x^2 + x + 1$  is not a factor, and  $x^2 + 1$  cannot be a factor because it has a zero, whereas  $\bar{h}(x)$  does not.] Thus,  $\bar{h}(x)$  is irreducible over  $Z_2[x]$ . This guarantees that  $h(x)$  is irreducible over  $Q$ .

EXAMPLE 9 Let  $f(x) = x^5 + 2x + 4$ . Obviously, neither Theorem 17.1 nor the Mod 2 Irreducibility Test helps here. Let's try mod 3. Substitution of 0, 1, and 2 into  $\bar{f}(x)$  does not yield 0, so there are no linear factors. But  $\bar{f}(x)$  may have a quadratic factor. If so, we may assume it has the form  $x^2 + ax + b$  where  $b \neq 0$  (see Exercise 5). This gives six possibilities to check. We can immediately rule out each of the six that has a zero over  $Z_3$ , since  $\bar{f}(x)$  does not have one. This leaves only  $x^2 + 1, x^2 + x + 2$ , and  $x^2 + 2x + 2$  to check. These are eliminated by long division. So, since  $\bar{f}(x)$  is irreducible over  $Z_3$ ,  $f(x)$  is irreducible over  $Q$ . (Why is it unnecessary to check for cubic or fourth-degree factors?)

Another important irreducibility test is the following one, credited to Ferdinand Eisenstein (1823-1852), a student of Gauss. The corollary was first proved by Gauss by a different method.

# Theorem 17.4 Eisenstein's Criterion (1850)

Let

$$
f (x) = a _ {n} x ^ {n} + a _ {n - 1} x ^ {n - 1} + \dots + a _ {0} \in Z [ x ].
$$

If there is a prime  $p$  such that  $p \nmid a_n, p \mid a_{n-1}, \ldots, p \mid a_0$  and  $p^2 \nmid a_0$ , then  $f(x)$  is irreducible over  $Q$ .

PROOF If  $f(x)$  is reducible over  $Q$ , we know by Theorem 17.2 that there exist elements  $g(x)$  and  $h(x)$  in  $Z[x]$  such that  $f(x) = g(x)h(x)$ ,  $1 \leq \deg g(x)$ , and  $1 \leq \deg h(x) < n$ . Say  $g(x) = b_r x^r + \dots + b_0$  and  $h(x) = c_s x^s + \dots + c_0$ . Then, since  $p \mid a_0, p^2 \nmid a_0$ , and  $a_0 = b_0 c_0$ , it follows that  $p$  divides one of  $b_0$  and  $c_0$  but not the other. Let us say  $p \mid b_0$  and  $p \nmid c_0$ . Also, since  $p \nmid a_n = b_r c_s$ , we know that  $p \nmid b_r$ . So, there is a least integer  $t$  such that  $p \nmid b_t$ . Now, consider  $a_t = b_t c_0 + b_{t-1} c_1 + \dots + b_0 c_t$ . By assumption,  $p$  divides  $a_t$  and, by

choice of  $t$ , every summand on the right after the first one is divisible by  $p$ . Clearly, this forces  $p$  to divide  $b_{t}c_{0}$  as well. This is impossible, however, since  $p$  is prime and  $p$  divides neither  $b_{t}$  nor  $c_{0}$ .

# Corollary Irreducibility of  $p$ th Cyclotomic Polynomial

For any prime  $p$ , the  $p$ th cyclotomic polynomial

$$
\Phi_ {p} (x) = \frac {x ^ {p} - 1}{x - 1} = x ^ {p - 1} + x ^ {p - 2} + \dots + x + 1
$$

is irreducible over  $Q$ .

PROOF Let

$$
f (x) = \Phi_ {p} (x + 1) = \frac {(x + 1) ^ {p} - 1}{(x + 1) - 1} = x ^ {p - 1} + \binom {p} {1} x ^ {p - 2} \binom {p} {2} x ^ {p - 3} + \dots + \binom {p} {1}.
$$

Then, since  $\binom{p}{k} = \frac{p!}{(p-k)!k!}$ , every coefficient except that of  $x^{p-1}$  is divisible by  $p$  and the constant term is not divisible by  $p^2$ , by Eisenstein's Criterion,  $f(x)$  is irreducible over  $Q$ . So, if  $\Phi_p(x) = g(x)h(x)$  were a nontrivial factorization of  $\Phi_p(x)$  over  $Q$ , then  $f(x) = \Phi_p(x+1) = g(x+1) \cdot h(x+1)$  would be a nontrivial factorization of  $f(x)$  over  $Q$ . Since this is impossible, we conclude that  $\Phi_p(x)$  is irreducible over  $Q$ .

EXAMPLE 10 The polynomial  $3x^{5} + 15x^{4} - 20x^{3} + 10x + 20$  is irreducible over  $Q$  because  $5 \nmid 3$  and  $25 \nmid 20$  but  $5$  does divide  $15, -20, 10,$  and  $20$ .

The principal reason for our interest in irreducible polynomials stems from the fact that there is an intimate connection among them, maximal ideals, and fields. This connection is revealed in the next theorem and its first corollary.

# Theorem 17.5  $\langle p(x)\rangle$  Is Maximal If and Only If  $p(x)$  Is Irreducible

Let  $F$  be a field and let  $p(x) \in F[x]$ . Then  $\langle p(x) \rangle$  is a maximal ideal in  $F[x]$  if and only if  $p(x)$  is irreducible over  $F$ .

PROOF Suppose first that  $\langle p(x) \rangle$  is a maximal ideal in  $F[x]$ . Clearly,  $p(x)$  is neither the zero polynomial nor a unit in  $F[x]$ , because neither  $\{0\}$  nor  $F[x]$  is a maximal ideal in  $F[x]$ . If  $p(x) = g(x)h(x)$  is a factorization of  $p(x)$  over  $F$ , then  $\langle p(x) \rangle \subseteq \langle g(x) \rangle \subseteq F[x]$ . Thus,  $\langle p(x) \rangle = \langle g(x) \rangle$  or  $F[x] = \langle g(x) \rangle$ . In the first case, we must have  $\deg p(x) = \deg g(x)$ . In the second case, it follows that  $\deg g(x) = 0$  and, consequently,  $\deg h(x) = \deg p(x)$ . Thus,  $p(x)$  cannot be written as a product of two polynomials in  $F[x]$  of lower degree.

Now, suppose that  $p(x)$  is irreducible over  $F$ . Let  $I$  be any ideal of  $F[x]$  such that  $\langle p(x) \rangle \subseteq I \subseteq F[x]$ . Because  $F[x]$  is a principal ideal domain, we know that  $I = \langle g(x) \rangle$  for some  $g(x)$  in  $F[x]$ . So,  $p(x) \in \langle g(x) \rangle$  and, therefore,  $p(x) = g(x)h(x)$ , where  $h(x) \in F[x]$ . Since  $p(x)$  is irreducible over  $F$ , it follows

that either  $g(x)$  is a constant or  $h(x)$  is a constant. In the first case, we have  $I = F[x]$ ; in the second case, we have  $\langle p(x) \rangle = \langle g(x) \rangle = I$ . So,  $\langle p(x) \rangle$  is maximal in  $F[x]$ .

# Corollary 1  $F[x] / \langle p(x) \rangle$  Is a Field

Let  $F$  be a field and  $p(x)$  be an irreducible polynomial over  $F$ . Then  $F[x] / \langle p(x) \rangle$  is a field.

PROOF This follows directly from Theorems 17.5 and 14.4.  $\square$

The next corollary is a polynomial analog of Euclid's Lemma for primes (see Chapter 0).

# Corollary 2  $p(x) \mid a(x)b(x)$  implies  $p(x) \mid a(x)$  or  $p(x) \mid b(x)$

Let  $F$  be a field and let  $p(x), a(x), b(x) \in F[x]$ . If  $p(x)$  is irreducible over  $F$  and  $p(x) \mid a(x)b(x)$ , then  $p(x) \mid a(x)$  or  $p(x) \mid b(x)$ .

PROOF Since  $p(x)$  is irreducible,  $F[x] / \langle p(x) \rangle$  is a field and, therefore, an integral domain. From Theorem 14.3, we know that  $\langle p(x) \rangle$  is a prime ideal, and since  $p(x)$  divides  $a(x)b(x)$ , we have  $a(x)b(x) \in \langle p(x) \rangle$ . Thus,  $a(x) \in \langle p(x) \rangle$  or  $b(x) \in \langle p(x) \rangle$ . This means that  $p(x) \mid a(x)$  or  $p(x) \mid b(x)$ .

The next two examples put the theory to work.

# EXAMPLE 11 Field With Eight Elements

We construct a field with eight elements. By Theorem 17.1 and Corollary 1 of Theorem 17.5, it suffices to find a cubic polynomial over  $Z_{2}$  that has no zero in  $Z_{2}$ . By inspection,  $x^{3} + x + 1$  fills the bill. Thus,  $Z_{2}[x] / \langle x^{3} + x + 1 \rangle = \{ax^{2} + bx + c + \langle x^{3} + x + 1 \rangle | a, b, c \in Z_{2}\}$  is a field with eight elements. For practice, let us do a few calculations in this field. Since the sum of two polynomials of the form  $ax^{2} + bx + c$  is another one of the same form, addition is easy. For example,

$$
\begin{array}{l} \left(x ^ {2} + x + 1 + \langle x ^ {3} + x + 1 \rangle\right) + \left(x ^ {2} + 1 + \langle x ^ {3} + x + 1 \rangle\right) \\ = x + \langle x ^ {3} + x + 1 \rangle . \\ \end{array}
$$

On the other hand, multiplication of two coset representatives need not yield one of the original eight coset representatives:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \left(x ^ {2} + x + 1 + \langle x ^ {3} + x + 1 \rangle\right) \cdot \left(x ^ {2} + 1 + \langle x ^ {3} + x + 1 \rangle\right) \\ = x ^ {4} + x ^ {3} + x + 1 + \langle x ^ {3} + x + 1 \rangle = x ^ {4} + \langle x ^ {3} + x + 1 \rangle \\ \end{array}
$$

(since the ideal absorbs the last three terms). How do we express this in the form  $ax^2 + bx + c + \langle x^3 + x + 1 \rangle$ ? One way is to long divide  $x^4$  by

Table 17.1 A Partial Multiplication Table for Example 10.

$x^{3} + x + 1$  to obtain the remainder of  $x^{2} + x$  (just as one reduces  $12 + \langle 5\rangle$  to  $2 + \langle 5\rangle$  by dividing 12 by 5 to obtain the remainder 2). Another way is to observe that  $x^{3} + x + 1 + \langle x^{3} + x + 1\rangle = 0 + \langle x^{3} + x + 1\rangle$  implies  $x^{3} + \langle x^{3} + x + 1\rangle = x + 1 + \langle x^{3} + x + 1\rangle$ . Thus, we may multiply both sides by  $x$  to obtain

$$
x ^ {4} + \langle x ^ {3} + x + 1 \rangle = x ^ {2} + x + \langle x ^ {3} + x + 1 \rangle .
$$

Similarly,

$$
\begin{array}{l} \left(x ^ {2} + x + \langle x ^ {3} + x + 1 \rangle\right) \cdot \left(x + \langle x ^ {3} + x + 1 \rangle\right) \\ = x ^ {3} + x ^ {2} + \langle x ^ {3} + x + 1 \rangle \\ = x ^ {2} + x + 1 + \langle x ^ {3} + x + 1 \rangle . \\ \end{array}
$$

A partial multiplication table for this field is given in Table 17.1. To simplify the notation, we indicate a coset by its representative only. (Complete the table yourself. Keep in mind that  $x^3$  can be replaced by  $x + 1$  and  $x^4$  by  $x^2 + x$ .)

Recall from Example 9 in Chapter 13 that we showed by direct calculations that  $Z_{3}[i]$  is a field with 9 elements. Now that we have much more theory, we can construct a field with  $p^2$  elements for every prime  $p = 3 \mod 4$ . Interestingly, we will invoke results from Chapters 8, 14, and 15 in our proof. In Chapter 21, we will prove the truly astonishing fact that, up to isomorphism, for every prime  $p$  and every positive integer  $n$ , there is exactly one field of order  $p^n$  and no others exist.

# EXAMPLE 12 Fields With  $p^2$  Elements

Let  $p$  be a prime such that  $p = 3 \mod 4$ . Then  $Z_{p}[i] = \{a + bi \mid a, b \in Z_{p}\}$ , where  $i^{2} = -1$ , is a field with  $p^{2}$  elements. To see this we proceed by converting this problem to one that involves polynomials over  $Z_{p}$ . Observe that the mapping from  $Z_{p}[x]$  to  $Z_{p}[i]$  given by  $f(x) \to f(i)$  is a ring homomorphism with kernel  $x^{2} + 1$ . Then, by the First Isomorphism Theorem for Rings, we know that  $Z_{p}[x] / \langle x^{2} + 1 \rangle$  is isomorphic to  $Z_{p}[i]$ . By Theorem 14.4, we know that  $Z_{p}[x] / \langle x^{2} + 1 \rangle$  is a field if  $x^{2} + 1$  is a maximal ideal and, by Theorem 17.5, this is true if  $x^{2} + 1$  has no zeros in  $Z_{p}$ . So, suppose, by way of contradiction, that  $x^{2} + 1$  does have a zero  $a$  in  $Z_{p}$ . Then  $a^{2} \equiv -1 \mod p$ . This implies that  $|a| = 4$ . Since  $a \in U(p)$ , we then have that 4 divides  $|U(p)| = p - 1$ . But then,  $p - 1 = 4t$  and  $p = 1 \mod 4$ , which is a contradiction.

# Unique Factorization in  $Z[x]$

As a further application of the ideas presented in this chapter, we next prove that  $Z[x]$  has an important factorization property. In Chapter 18, we will study this property in greater depth. The first proof of Theorem 17.6 was given by Gauss. In reading this theorem and its proof, keep in mind that the units in  $Z[x]$  are precisely  $f(x) = 1$  and  $f(x) = -1$  (see Exercise 25 in Chapter 12), the irreducible polynomials of degree 0 over  $Z$  are precisely those of the form  $f(x) = p$  and  $f(x) = -p$  where  $p$  is a prime, and every nonconstant polynomial from  $Z[x]$  that is irreducible over  $Z$  is primitive (see Exercise 3). The theorem shows that the irreducibles in  $Z[x]$  play a role analogous to the role that primes play in  $Z$  in that every polynomial in  $Z[x]$  of positive degree is uniquely expressible as a product of irreducibles in  $Z[x]$ .

# Theorem 17.6 Unique Factorization in  $Z[x]$

Every polynomial in  $Z[x]$  that is not the zero polynomial or a unit in  $Z[x]$  can be written in the form  $b_{1}b_{2}\dots b_{s}p_{1}(x)p_{2}(x)\dots p_{m}(x)$ , where the  $b_{i}'s$  are irreducible polynomials of degree 0 and the  $p_{i}(x)'s$  are irreducible polynomials of positive degree in  $Z[x]$ . Furthermore, if

$$
b _ {1} b _ {2} \dots b _ {s} p _ {1} (x) p _ {2} (x) \dots p _ {m} (x) = c _ {1} c _ {2} \dots c _ {t} q _ {1} (x) q _ {2} (x) \dots q _ {n} (x),
$$

where the  $b_i$ 's and  $c_i$ 's are irreducible polynomials of degree 0 and the  $p_i(x)$ 's and  $q_i(x)$ 's are irreducible polynomials of positive degree, then  $s = t, m = n$ , and, after renumbering the  $c$ 's and  $q(x)$ 's, we have  $b_i = \pm c_i$  for  $i = 1, \ldots, s$  and  $p_i(x) = \pm q_i(x)$  for  $i = 1, \ldots, m$ .

PROOF Let  $f(x)$  be a nonzero, nonunit polynomial from  $Z[x]$ . If  $\deg f(x) = 0$ , then  $f(x)$  is constant and the result follows from the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. If  $\deg f(x) > 0$ , let  $b$  denote the content of  $f(x)$ , and let  $b_1b_2\cdots b_s$  be the factorization of  $b$  as a product of primes. Then,  $f(x) = b_1b_2\cdots b_sf_1(x)$ , where  $f_1(x)$  belongs to  $Z[x]$ , is primitive and  $\deg f_1(x) = \deg f(x)$ . Thus, to prove the existence portion of the theorem, it suffices to show that a primitive polynomial  $f(x)$  of positive degree can be written as a product of irreducible polynomials of positive degree. We proceed by induction on  $\deg f(x)$ . If  $\deg f(x) = 1$ , then  $f(x)$  is already irreducible and we are done. Now suppose that every primitive polynomial of degree less than  $\deg f(x)$  can be written as a product of irreducibles of positive degree. If  $f(x)$  is irreducible, there is nothing to prove. Otherwise,  $f(x) = g(x)h(x)$ , where both  $g(x)$  and  $h(x)$  are primitive and have degree less than that of  $f(x)$ . Thus, by induction, both  $g(x)$  and  $h(x)$  can be written as a product of irreducibles of positive degree. Clearly, then,  $f(x)$  is also such a product.

To prove the uniqueness portion of the theorem, suppose that

$$
\begin{array}{l} f (x) = b _ {1} b _ {2} \dots b _ {s} p _ {1} (x) p _ {2} (x) \dots p _ {m} (x) \\ = c _ {1} c _ {2} \dots c _ {t} q _ {1} (x) q _ {2} (x) \dots q _ {n} (x), \\ \end{array}
$$

where the  $b_i$ 's and  $c_i$ 's are irreducible polynomials of degree 0 and the  $p_i(x)$ 's and  $q_i(x)$ 's are irreducible polynomials of positive degree. Let  $b = b_1b_2\cdots b_s$  and  $c = c_1c_2\cdots c_t$ . Since the  $p(x)$ 's and  $q(x)$ 's are primitive, it follows from Gauss's Lemma that  $p_1(x)p_2(x)\cdots p_m(x)$  and  $q_1(x)q_2(x)\cdots q_n(x)$  are primitive. Hence, both  $b$  and  $c$  must equal plus or minus the content of  $f(x)$  and, therefore, are equal in absolute value. It then follows from the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic that  $s = t$  and, after renumbering,  $b_i = \pm c_i$  for  $i = 1, 2, \ldots, s$ . Thus, by canceling the constant terms in the two factorizations for  $f(x)$ , we have  $p_1(x)p_2(x)\cdots p_m(x) = \pm q_1(x)q_2(x)\cdots q_n(x)$ . Now, viewing the  $p(x)$ 's and  $q(x)$ 's as elements of  $Q[x]$  and noting that  $p_1(x)$  divides  $q_1(x)\cdots q_n(x)$ , it follows from Corollary 2 of Theorem 17.5 and induction (see Exercise 35) that  $p_1(x)|q_i(x)$  for some  $i$ . By renumbering, we may assume  $i = 1$ . Then, since  $q_1(x)$  is irreducible, we have  $q_1(x) = (r / s)p_1(x)$ , where  $r, s \in Z$ . However, because both  $q_1(x)$  and  $p_1(x)$  are primitive, we must have  $r / s = \pm 1$ . So,  $q_1(x) = \pm p_1(x)$ . Also, after canceling, we have  $p_2(x)\cdots p_m(x) = \pm q_2(x)\cdots q_n(x)$ . Now, we may repeat the argument above with  $p_2(x)$  in place of  $p_1(x)$ . If  $m < n$ , after  $m$  such steps we would have 1 on the left and a nonconstant polynomial on the right. Clearly, this is impossible. On the other hand, if  $m > n$ , after  $n$  steps we would have  $\pm 1$  on the right and a nonconstant polynomial on the left—another impossibility. So,  $m = n$  and  $p_i(x) = \pm q_i(x)$  after suitable renumbering of the  $q(x)$ 's.

# Weird Dice: An Application of Unique Factorization

EXAMPLE 13 Consider an ordinary pair of dice whose faces are labeled 1 through 6. The probability of rolling a sum of 2 is  $1/36$ , the probability of rolling a sum of 3 is  $2/36$ , and so on. In a 1978 issue of Scientific American, Martin Gardner remarked that if one were to label the six faces of one cube with the integers 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4 and the six faces of another cube with the integers 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, then the probability of obtaining any particular sum with these dice (called Sicherman dice) would be the same as the probability of rolling that sum with ordinary dice (i.e.,  $1/36$  for a 2,  $2/36$  for a 3, and so on). See Figure 17.1. In this example, we show how the Sicherman labels can be derived, and that they are the only possible such labels besides 1 through 6. To do so, we utilize the fact that  $Z[x]$  has the unique factorization property. To begin, let us ask ourselves how we may obtain a sum of 6, say, with an ordinary pair of dice. Well, there are five possibilities for the two faces:  $(5,1)$ ,  $(4,2)$ ,  $(3,3)$ ,  $(2,4)$ , and  $(1,5)$ . Next we consider the product of the two polynomials created by using the ordinary dice labels as exponents:

$$
(x ^ {6} + x ^ {5} + x ^ {4} + x ^ {3} + x ^ {2} + x) (x ^ {6} + x ^ {5} + x ^ {4} + x ^ {3} + x ^ {2} + x).
$$

Observe that we pick up the term  $x^6$  in this product in precisely the following ways:  $x^5 \cdot x^1, x^4 \cdot x^2, x^3 \cdot x^3, x^2 \cdot x^4, x^1 \cdot x^5$ . Notice the correspondence

![](images/96a9c6b90562ca38c2bd5035f806999003ee74a29df13274866242dfde4e8002.jpg)  
Figure 17.1

![](images/ac10abd295f17c432156edbc4ba18e0220f677d20fb66ecc1a9064baf423a4bc.jpg)

between pairs of labels whose sums are 6 and pairs of terms whose products are  $x^6$ . This correspondence is one-to-one, and it is valid for all sums and all dice—including the Sicherman dice and any other dice that yield the desired probabilities. So, let  $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6$  and  $b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4, b_5, b_6$  be any two lists of positive integer labels for the faces of a pair of cubes with the property that the probability of rolling any particular sum with these dice (let us call them weird dice) is the same as the probability of rolling that sum with ordinary dice labeled 1 through 6. Using our observation about products of polynomials, this means that

$$
\begin{array}{l} (x ^ {6} + x ^ {5} + x ^ {4} + x ^ {3} + x ^ {2} + x) (x ^ {6} + x ^ {5} + x ^ {4} + x ^ {3} + x ^ {2} + x) \\ = \left(x ^ {a _ {1}} + x ^ {a _ {2}} + x ^ {a _ {3}} + x ^ {a _ {4}} + x ^ {a _ {5}} + x ^ {a _ {6}}\right) \cdot \\ \left(x ^ {b _ {1}} + x ^ {b _ {2}} + x ^ {b _ {3}} + x ^ {b _ {4}} + x ^ {b _ {5}} + x ^ {b _ {6}}\right). \tag {17.1} \\ \end{array}
$$

Now all we have to do is solve this equation for the  $a$ 's and  $b$ 's. Here is where unique factorization in  $Z[x]$  comes in. The polynomial  $x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x$  factors uniquely into irreducibles as

$$
x (x + 1) \left(x ^ {2} + x + 1\right) \left(x ^ {2} - x + 1\right)
$$

so that the left-hand side of Equation (17.1) has the irreducible factorization

$$
x ^ {2} (x + 1) ^ {2} \left(x ^ {2} + x + 1\right) ^ {2} \left(x ^ {2} - x + 1\right) ^ {2}.
$$

So, by Theorem 17.6, this means that these factors are the only possible irreducible factors of  $P(x) = x^{a_1} + x^{a_2} + x^{a_3} + x^{a_4} + x^{a_5} + x^{a_6}$ . Thus,  $P(x)$  has the form

$$
x ^ {q} (x + 1) ^ {r} \left(x ^ {2} + x + 1\right) ^ {t} \left(x ^ {2} - x + 1\right) ^ {u},
$$

where  $0\leq q,r,t,u\leq 2$

To restrict further the possibilities for these four parameters, we evaluate  $P(1)$  in two ways.  $P(1) = 1^{a_1} + 1^{a_2} + \dots + 1^{a_6} = 6$  and  $P(1) = 1^q 2^r 3^t 1^u$ . Clearly, this means that  $r = 1$  and  $t = 1$ . What about  $q$ ? Evaluating  $P(0)$  in two ways shows that  $q \neq 0$ . On the other hand, if  $q = 2$ , the smallest possible

sum one could roll with the corresponding labels for dice would be 3. Since this violates our assumption, we have now reduced our list of possibilities for  $q, r, t$ , and  $u$  to  $q = 1$ ,  $r = 1$ ,  $t = 1$ , and  $u = 0, 1, 2$ . Let's consider each of these possibilities in turn.

When  $u = 0$ ,  $P(x) = x^4 + x^3 + x^3 + x^2 + x^2 + x$ , so the die labels are 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1—a Sicherman die.

When  $u = 1$ ,  $P(x) = x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x$ , so the die labels are 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1—an ordinary die.

When  $u = 2, P(x) = x^8 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x$ , so the die labels are 8, 6, 5, 4, 3, 1—the other Sicherman die.

This proves that the Sicherman dice do give the same probabilities as ordinary dice and that they are the only other pair of dice that have this property.

SERGE LANG was a prolific mathematician, inspiring teacher, and political activist. He was born near Paris on May 19, 1927. His family moved to Los Angeles when he was a teenager. Lang received a B.A. in physics from Caltech in 1946 and a Ph.D. in mathematics from Princeton in 1951 under Emil Artin. His first permanent position was at Columbia University in 1955, but in 1971 Lang resigned his position at Columbia as a protest against Columbia's handling of Vietnam antiwar protesters. He joined Yale University in 1972 and remained there until his retirement.

Lang made significant contributions to number theory, algebraic geometry, differential geometry, and analysis. He wrote

more than 120 research articles and 60 books. His most famous and influential book was his graduate-level Algebra. Lang was a prize-winning teacher known for his extraordinary devotion to students. Lang often got into heated discussions about mathematics, the arts, and politics. In one incident, he threatened to hit a fellow mathematician with a bronze bust for not conceding it was self-evident that the Beatles were greater musicians than Beethoven. Among Lang's honors were the Steele Prize for Mathematical Exposition from the American Mathematical Society, the Cole Prize in Algebra (see Chapter 24), and election to the National Academy of Sciences. Lang died on September 25, 2005, at the age of 78.

# Divisibility in Integral Domains

Fundamental definitions do not arise at the start but at the end of the exploration, because in order to define a thing you must know what it is and what it is good for.

# Irreducibles, Primes

In the preceding two chapters, we focused on factoring polynomials over the integers or a field. Several of those results—unique factorization in  $Z[x]$  and the division algorithm for  $F[x]$ , for instance—are natural counterparts to theorems about the integers. In this chapter and the next, we examine factoring in a more abstract setting.

# Definitions Associates, Irreducibles, Primes

Elements  $a$  and  $b$  of an integral domain  $D$  are called associates if  $a = ub$ , where  $u$  is a unit of  $D$ . A nonzero element  $a$  of an integral domain  $D$  is called an irreducible if  $a$  is not a unit and, whenever  $b, c \in D$  with  $a = bc$ , then  $b$  or  $c$  is a unit. A nonzero element  $a$  of an integral domain  $D$  is called a prime if  $a$  is not a unit and  $a \mid bc$  implies  $a \mid b$  or  $a \mid c$ .

Roughly speaking, an irreducible is an element that can be factored only in a trivial way. Notice that an element  $a$  is a prime if and only if  $\langle a\rangle$  is a prime ideal.

Relating the definitions above to the integers may seem a bit confusing, since in Chapter 0 we defined a positive integer to be a prime if it satisfies our definition of an irreducible, and we proved that a prime integer satisfies the definition of a prime in an integral domain (Euclid's Lemma). The source of the confusion is that in the case of the integers, the concepts of irreducibles and primes are equivalent, but in general, as we will soon see, they are not.

The distinction between primes and irreducibles is best illustrated by integral domains of the form  $Z[\sqrt{d}] = \{a + b\sqrt{d} \mid a, b \in Z\}$ , where  $d$  is not 1 and is not divisible by the square of a prime. (These rings are of fundamental

importance in number theory.) To analyze these rings, we need a convenient method of determining their units, irreducibles, and primes. To do this, we define a function  $N$ , called the norm, from  $Z[\sqrt{d}]$  into the nonnegative integers by  $N(a + b\sqrt{d}) = |a^2 - db^2|$ . We leave it to the reader (Exercise 1) to verify the following four properties:  $N(x) = 0$  if and only if  $x = 0$ ;  $N(xy) = N(x)N(y)$  for all  $x$  and  $y$ ;  $x$  is a unit if and only if  $N(x) = 1$ ; and, if  $N(x)$  is prime, then  $x$  is irreducible in  $Z[\sqrt{d}]$ .

EXAMPLE 1 We exhibit an irreducible in  $Z[\sqrt{-3}]$  that is not prime. Here,  $N(a + b\sqrt{-3}) = a^2 + 3b^2$ . Consider  $1 + \sqrt{-3}$ . Suppose that we can factor this as  $xy$ , where neither  $x$  nor  $y$  is a unit. Then  $N(xy) = N(x)N(y) = N(1 + \sqrt{-3}) = 4$ , and it follows that  $N(x) = 2$ . But there are no integers  $a$  and  $b$  that satisfy  $a^2 + 3b^2 = 2$ . Thus,  $x$  or  $y$  is a unit and  $1 + \sqrt{-3}$  is an irreducible. To verify that it is not prime, we observe that  $(1 + \sqrt{-3})(1 - \sqrt{-3}) = 4 = 2 \cdot 2$ , so that  $1 + \sqrt{-3}$  divides  $2 \cdot 2$ . On the other hand, for integers  $a$  and  $b$  to exist so that  $2 = (1 + \sqrt{-3})(a + b\sqrt{-3}) = (a - 3b) + (a + b)\sqrt{-3}$ , we must have  $a - 3b = 2$  and  $a + b = 0$ , which is impossible.

Showing that an element of a ring of the form  $Z[\sqrt{d}]$  is irreducible is more difficult when  $d > 1$ . The next example illustrates one method of doing this. The example also shows that the converse of the fourth property above for the norm is not true. That is, it shows that  $x$  may be irreducible even if  $N(x)$  is not prime.

EXAMPLE 2 The element 7 is irreducible in the ring  $Z[\sqrt{5}]$ . To verify this assertion, suppose that  $7 = xy$ , where neither  $x$  nor  $y$  is a unit. Then  $49 = N(7) = N(x)N(y)$ , and since  $x$  is not a unit, we cannot have  $N(x) = 1$ . This leaves only the case  $N(x) = 7$ . Let  $x = a + b\sqrt{5}$ . Then there are integers  $a$  and  $b$  satisfying  $|a^2 - 5b^2| = 7$ . This means that  $a^2 - 5b^2 = \pm 7$ . Keeping in mind that any integer solution of the equation  $a^2 - 5b^2 = \pm 7$  would also be a solution in  $Z_n$  for every positive integer  $n$ , we have, modulo 5, that we need only check for  $a^2 = 2$  and  $a^2 = -2 = 3$ . Trying all five cases for  $a$  we see that there is no solution.

Example 1 raises the question of whether or not there is an integral domain containing a prime that is not an irreducible. The answer: no.

# Theorem 18.1 Prime Implies Irreducible

In an integral domain, every prime is an irreducible.

PROOF Suppose that  $a$  is a prime in an integral domain and  $a = bc$ . We must show that  $b$  or  $c$  is a unit. By the definition of prime, we know that  $a \mid b$  or  $a \mid c$ . Say  $at = b$ . Then  $1b = b = at = (bc)t = b(ct)$  and, by cancellation,  $1 = ct$ . Thus,  $c$  is a unit.

Recall that a principal ideal domain is an integral domain in which every ideal has the form  $\langle a\rangle$ . The next theorem reveals a circumstance in which primes and irreducibles are equivalent.

# Theorem 18.2 PID Implies Irreducible Equals Prime

In a principal ideal domain, an element is an irreducible if and only if it is a prime.

PROOF Theorem 18.1 shows that primes are irreducibles. To prove the converse, let  $a$  be an irreducible element of a principal ideal domain  $D$  and suppose that  $a \mid bc$ . We must show that  $a \mid b$  or  $a \mid c$ . Consider the ideal  $I = \{ax + by \mid x, y \in D\}$  and let  $\langle d \rangle = I$ . Since  $a \in I$ , we can write  $a = dr$ , and because  $a$  is irreducible,  $d$  is a unit or  $r$  is a unit. If  $d$  is a unit, then  $I = D$  and we may write  $1 = ax + by$ . Then  $c = acx + bcy$ , and since  $a$  divides both terms on the right,  $a$  also divides  $c$ .

On the other hand, if  $r$  is a unit, then  $\langle a \rangle = \langle d \rangle = I$ , and, because  $b \in I$ , there is an element  $t$  in  $D$  such that  $at = b$ . Thus,  $a$  divides  $b$ .

It is an easy consequence of the respective division algorithms for  $Z$  and  $F[x]$ , where  $F$  is a field, that  $Z$  and  $F[x]$  are principal ideal domains (see Exercise 57 in Chapter 14 and Theorem 16.3). Our next example shows, however, that one of the most familiar rings is not a principal ideal domain.

EXAMPLE 3 We show that  $Z[x]$  is not a principal ideal domain. Consider the ideal  $I = \langle 2, x \rangle$ . We claim that  $I$  is not of the form  $\langle h(x) \rangle$ . If this were so, there would be  $f(x)$  and  $g(x)$  in  $Z[x]$  such that  $2 = h(x)f(x)$  and  $x = h(x)g(x)$ , since both 2 and  $x$  belong to  $I$ . By the degree rule (Exercise 19 in Chapter 16),  $0 = \deg 2 = \deg h(x) + \deg f(x)$ , so that  $h(x)$  is a constant polynomial. To determine which constant, we observe that  $2 = h(1)f(1)$ . Thus,  $h(1) = \pm 1$  or  $\pm 2$ . Since 1 is not in  $I$ , we must have  $h(x) = \pm 2$ . But then  $x = \pm 2g(x)$ , which is nonsense.

We have previously proved that the integral domains  $Z$  and  $Z[x]$  have important factorization properties: Every integer greater than 1 can be uniquely factored as a product of irreducibles (i.e., primes), and every nonzero, nonunit polynomial can be uniquely factored as a product of irreducible polynomials. It is natural to ask whether all integral domains have this property. The question of unique factorization in integral domains first arose with the efforts to solve a famous problem in number theory that goes by the name Fermat's Last Theorem.

# Historical Discussion of Fermat's Last Theorem

There are infinitely many nonzero integers  $x, y, z$  that satisfy the equation  $x^{2} + y^{2} = z^{2}$ . But what about the equation  $x^{3} + y^{3} = z^{3}$  or, more generally,  $x^{n} + y^{n} = z^{n}$ , where  $n$  is an integer greater than 2 and  $x, y, z$  are nonzero integers? Well, no one has ever found a single solution of this equation, and for more than three centuries many have tried to prove that there is none. The tremendous effort put forth by the likes of Euler, Legendre, Abel, Gauss, Dirichlet, Cauchy, Kummer, Kronecker, and Hilbert to prove that there are no solutions to this equation has greatly influenced the development of ring

theory.

About a thousand years ago, Arab mathematicians gave an incorrect proof that there were no solutions when  $n = 3$ . The problem lay dormant until 1637, when the French mathematician Pierre de Fermat (1601-1665) wrote in the margin of a book, "...it is impossible to separate a cube into two cubes, a fourth power into two fourth powers, or, generally, any power above the second into two powers of the same degree: I have discovered a truly marvelous demonstration [of this general theorem] which this margin is too narrow to contain."

Because Fermat gave no proof, many mathematicians tried to prove the result. The case where  $n = 3$  was done by Euler in 1770, although his proof was incomplete. The case where  $n = 4$  is elementary and was done by Fermat himself. The case where  $n = 5$  was done in 1825 by Dirichlet, who had just turned 20, and by Legendre, who was past 70. Since the validity of the case for a particular integer implies the validity for all multiples of that integer, the next case of interest was  $n = 7$ . This case resisted the efforts of the best mathematicians until it was done by Gabriel Lamé in 1839. In 1847, Lamé stirred excitement by announcing that he had completely solved the problem. His approach was to factor the expression  $x^p + y^p$ , where  $p$  is an odd prime, into

$$
(x + y) (x + \alpha y) \dots (x + \alpha^ {p - 1} y),
$$

where  $\alpha$  is the complex number  $\cos(2\pi / p) + i \sin(2\pi / p)$ . Thus, his factorization took place in the ring  $Z[\alpha] = \{a_0 + a_1\alpha + \dots + a_{p-1}\alpha^{p-1} \mid a_i \in Z\}$ . But Lamé made the mistake of assuming that, in such a ring, factorization into the product of irreducibles is unique. In fact, three years earlier, Ernst Eduard Kummer had proved that this is not always the case. Undaunted by the failure of unique factorization, Kummer began developing a theory to "save" factorization by creating a new type of number. Within a few weeks of Lamé's announcement, Kummer had shown that Fermat's Last Theorem is true for all primes of a special type. This proved that the theorem was true for all exponents less than 100, prime or not, except for 37, 59, 67, and 74. Kummer's work has led to the theory of ideals as we know it today.

Over the centuries, many proposed proofs have not held up under scrutiny. The famous number theorist Edmund Landau received so many of these that he had a form printed with "On page , lines to you will find there is a mistake." Martin Gardner, "Mathematical Games" columnist of Scientific American, had postcards printed to decline requests from readers asking him to examine their proofs.

Recent discoveries tying Fermat's Last Theorem closely to modern mathematical theories gave hope that these theories might eventually lead to a proof. In March 1988, newspapers and scientific publications worldwide carried news of a proof by Yoichi Miyaoka (see Figure 18.1). Within weeks, however, Miyaoka's proof was shown to be invalid. In June 1993, excitement spread through the mathematics community with the announcement that Andrew Wiles of Princeton University had proved Fermat's Last Theorem (see Figure 18.2). The Princeton mathematics department chairperson was quoted as saying, "When we heard it, people starting walking on air." But guess what. Yes, you guessed it! Once again a proof did not hold up under

# Doubts about Fermat solution Careful section

Careful scrutiny of a recently proposed proof of Fermat's last theorem (SN: 3/19/88, p.180) has turned up several flaws that cast doubt on the proof's validity. Japanese mathematician Yoichi Miyaoka, who is presently working at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn, West Germany, last week admitted that his proof has a serious problem. He is now studying how to revise his proof.

# A curvy path leads to Fermat's last theorem.

After more than 300 years, Fermat's last theorem may finally live up to its common designation as a theorem. In a dramatic announcement that caught the mathematical community completely by surprise, Andrew Wiles of Princeton University revealed last week that he had proved major parts of a significant conjecture in number theory. These results, in turn, establish the truth of Fermat's famous, devilishly simple conjecture.

"It's an amazing piece of work," says Peter C. Sarnak, one of Wiles' Princeton colleagues. "The proof hasn't been totally checked, but it's very convincing?"

Pierre de Fermat's last theorem goes back to the 17th century, when the French jurist and mathematician asserted that for any whole number  $n$  greater than 2, the equation  $[x.\mathrm{sup.n}] + [y.\mathrm{sup.n}] = [z.\mathrm{sup.n}]$  has no solution for which  $x$ ,  $y$ , and  $z$  are all whole numbers greater than zero.

Meanwhile, mathematicians had picked up some valuable hints of a potential avenue to a general proof that the conjecture is true. In the mid-1980s, Gerhard Frey of the University of the Saarlands in Saarbrucken, Germany, unexpectedly uncovered an intriguing link between Fermat% conjecture and a seemingly

Fermat's last theorem: a p-100 long search for a proof of Fermat's Theorem. A good read problem  
The end of a century-old last theorem, one of the most famous in history, is the Mathematischer, Yoiichi Miyaoka of the Tokyo mathematician, Yoichi Miyaoka of the Tokyo Metropolitan University, has proposed a proof for a key in the link of reasoning that establishes the theorem's link to a chain of reasoning that establishes the theorem's truth. If Miyaoka's proof survives the mathematical truth, then hermit's conjecture (as it might be called until a proof is firmly established) can be proved by a theorem.  
Miyako's method builds on work done by several Russian mathematicians and links important ideas in three mathematical fields: number theory, algebra and geometry. Though highly technical, his argument fills a fewer than a dozen manuscript pages -- short for such a significant mathematical proof. Miyako recently presented a sketch of his ideas at a seminar at the Maxi deny tive for Mathematics in Bonn,  
"It looks very nice," mathematician Don B. Zagier of the York Institute told Science  
The problem into an area of interest for which mathematicians had already developed a wide range of techniques for solving problems. A number of mathematicians, including Barry Mazur of Harvard University and Kenneth A. Ribet of the University of California, Berkeley, followed up Frey's surprising insight with additional results that ultimately tied Fermat's last theorem to a central conjecture in number theory (SN: 6/20/87, p.397).  
Named for Japanese mathematician Yutaka Taniyama, this conjecture concerns certain characteristics of elliptic curves. A proof of this conjecture would automatically imply that Fermat's last theorem must be true.

scrutiny. This story does have a happy ending. The mathematical community has agreed on the validity of the revised proof given by Wiles and Richard Taylor in September of 1994<sup>1</sup>.

In view of the fact that so many eminent mathematicians were unable to prove Fermat's Last Theorem, despite the availability of the vastly powerful theories, it seems highly improbable that Fermat had a correct proof. Most likely, he made the error that his successors made of assuming that the properties of integers, such as unique factorization, carry over to integral domains in general.

# Unique Factorization Domains

We now have the necessary terminology to formalize the idea of unique factorization.

# Definition Unique Factorization Domain (UFD)

An integral domain  $D$  is a unique factorization domain if

1. every nonzero element of  $D$  that is not a unit can be written as a product of irreducibles of  $D$ ; and  
2. the factorization into irreducibles is unique up to associates and the order in which the factors appear.

Another way to formulate part 2 of this definition is the following: If

$p_1^{n_1}p_2^{n_2}\dots p_r^{n_r}$  and  $q_{1}^{m_{1}}q_{2}^{m_{2}}\dots q_{s}^{m_{s}}$  are two factorizations of some element as a product of irreducibles, where no two of the  $p_i$ 's are associates and no two of the  $q_j$ 's are associates, then  $r = s$ , each  $p_i$  is an associate of one and only one  $q_{j}$ , and  $n_i = m_j$ .

Of course, the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic tells us that the ring of integers is a unique factorization domain, and Theorem 17.6 says that  $Z[x]$  is a unique factorization domain. In fact, as we shall soon see, most of the integral domains we have encountered are unique factorization domains.

Before proving our next theorem, we need the ascending chain condition for ideals.

# ■ Lemma Ascending Chain Condition for a PID

In a principal ideal domain, any strictly increasing chain of ideals  $I_1 \subset I_2 \subset \dots$  must be finite in length.

PROOF Let  $I_1 \subset I_2 \subset \dots$  be a chain of strictly increasing ideals in an integral domain  $D$ , and let  $I$  be the union of all the ideals in this chain. We leave it as an exercise (Exercise 3) to verify that  $I$  is an ideal of  $D$ .

Then, since  $D$  is a principal ideal domain, there is an element  $a$  in  $D$  such that  $I = \langle a \rangle$ . Because  $a \in I$  and  $I = \cup I_k$ ,  $a$  belongs to some member of the chain, say  $a \in I_n$ . Clearly, then, for any member  $I_i$  of the chain, we have  $I_i \subseteq I = \langle a \rangle \subseteq I_n$ , so that  $I_n$  must be the last member of the chain.

# Theorem 18.3 PID Implies UFD

Every principal ideal domain is a unique factorization domain.

PROOF Let  $D$  be a principal ideal domain and let  $a_0$  be any nonzero nonunit in  $D$ . We will show that  $a_0$  is a product of irreducibles (the product might consist of only one factor). We begin by showing that  $a_0$  has at least one irreducible factor. If  $a_0$  is irreducible, we are done. Thus, we may assume that  $a_0 = b_1a_1$ , where neither  $b_1$  nor  $a_1$  is a unit and  $a_1$  is nonzero. If  $a_1$  is not irreducible, then we can write  $a_1 = b_2a_2$ , where neither  $b_2$  nor  $a_2$  is a unit and  $a_2$  is nonzero. Continuing in this fashion, we obtain a sequence  $b_1, b_2, \ldots$  of elements that are not units in  $D$  and a sequence  $a_0, a_1, a_2, \ldots$  of nonzero elements of  $D$  with  $a_n = b_{n+1}a_{n+1}$  for each  $n$ . Hence,  $\langle a_0 \rangle \subset \langle a_1 \rangle \subset \dots$  is a strictly increasing chain of ideals (see Exercise 5), which, by the preceding lemma, must be finite, say,  $\langle a_0 \rangle \subset \langle a_1 \rangle \subset \dots \subset \langle a_r \rangle$ . In particular,  $a_r$  is an irreducible factor of  $a_0$ . This argument shows that every nonzero nonunit in  $D$  has at least one irreducible factor.

Now write  $a_0 = p_1c_1$ , where  $p_1$  is irreducible and  $c_1$  is not a unit. If  $c_1$  is not irreducible, then we can write  $c_1 = p_2c_2$ , where  $p_2$  is irreducible and  $c_2$  is not a unit. Continuing in this fashion, we obtain, as before, a strictly increasing sequence  $\langle a_0 \rangle \subset \langle c_1 \rangle \subset \langle c_2 \rangle \subset \dots$ , which must end in a finite number of steps. Let us say that the sequence ends with  $\langle c_s \rangle$ . Then  $c_s$  is irreducible and  $a_0 = p_1p_2\cdots p_sc_s$ , where each  $p_i$  is also irreducible. This

completes the proof that every nonzero nonunit of a principal ideal domain is a product of irreducibles.

It remains to be shown that the factorization is unique up to associates and the order in which the factors appear. To do this, suppose that some element  $a$  of  $D$  can be written

$$
a = p _ {1} p _ {2} \dots p _ {r} = q _ {1} q _ {2} \dots q _ {s},
$$

where the  $p$ 's and  $q$ 's are irreducible and repetition is permitted. We use induction on  $r$ . If  $r = 1$ , then  $a$  is irreducible and, clearly,  $s = 1$  and  $p_1 = q_1$ . So we may assume that any element that can be expressed as a product of fewer than  $r$  irreducible factors can be so expressed in only one way (up to order and associates). Since  $D$  is a principal ideal domain, by Theorem 18.2, each irreducible  $pi$  in the product  $p_1p_2\cdots p_r$  is prime. Then because  $p_1$  divides  $q_1q_2\cdots q_s$ ,  $p_1$  must divide some  $q_i$  (see Exercise 33), say  $p_1 \mid q_1$ . Then,  $q_1 = up_1$ , where  $u$  is a unit of  $D$ . Since

$$
u p _ {1} p _ {2} \dots p _ {r} = u q _ {1} q _ {2} \dots q _ {s} = q _ {1} (u q _ {2}) \dots q _ {s}
$$

and

$$
u p _ {1} = q _ {1},
$$

we have, by cancellation,

$$
p _ {2} \dots p _ {r} = (u q _ {2}) \dots q _ {s}.
$$

The induction hypothesis now tells us that these two factorizations are identical up to associates and the order in which the factors appear. Hence, the same is true about the two factorizations of  $a$ .

In the existence portion of the proof of Theorem 18.3, the only way we used the fact that the integral domain  $D$  is a principal ideal domain was to say that  $D$  has the property that there is no infinite, strictly increasing chain of ideals in  $D$ . An integral domain with this property is called a Noetherian domain, in honor of Emmy Noether, who inaugurated the use of chain conditions in algebra. Noetherian domains are of the utmost importance in algebraic geometry. One reason for this is that, for many important rings  $R$ , the polynomial ring  $R[x]$  is a Noetherian domain but not a principal ideal domain. One such example is  $Z[x]$ . In particular,  $Z[x]$  shows that a UFD need not be a PID (see Example 3).

As an immediate corollary of Theorem 18.3, we have the following fact.

# Corollary  $F[x]$  Is a UFD

Let  $F$  be a field. Then  $F[x]$  is a unique factorization domain.

PROOF By Theorem 16.4,  $F[x]$  is a principal ideal domain. So,  $F[x]$  is a unique factorization domain, as well.

As an application of the preceding corollary, we give an elegant proof, due to Richard Singer, of Eisenstein's Criterion (Theorem 17.4).

# EXAMPLE 4 Let

$$
f (x) = a _ {n} x ^ {n} + a _ {n - 1} x ^ {n - 1} + \dots + a _ {0} \in Z [ x ],
$$

and suppose that  $p$  is prime such that

$$
p \nmid a _ {n}, p \mid a _ {n - 1}, \dots , p \mid a _ {0} \quad \text {a n d} \quad p _ {2} \nmid a _ {0}.
$$

We will prove that  $f(x)$  is irreducible over  $Q$ . If  $f(x)$  is reducible over  $Q$ , we know by Theorem 17.2 that there exist elements  $g(x)$  and  $h(x)$  in  $Z[x]$  such that  $f(x) = g(x)h(x)$ ,  $1 \leq \deg g(x) < n$ , and  $1 \leq \deg h(x) < n$ . Let  $\bar{f}(x), \bar{g}(x)$ , and  $\bar{h}(x)$  be the polynomials in  $Z_p[x]$  obtained from  $f(x), g(x)$ , and  $h(x)$  by reducing all coefficients modulo  $p$ . Then, since  $p$  divides all the coefficients of  $f(x)$  except  $a_n$ , we have  $\bar{a}_n x^n = \bar{f}(x) = \bar{g}(x) \cdot \bar{h}(x)$ . Since  $Z_p$  is a field,  $Z_p[x]$  is a unique factorization domain. Thus,  $x | \bar{g}(x)$  and  $x | \bar{h}(x)$ . So,  $\bar{g}(0) = \bar{h}(0) = 0$  and, therefore,  $p | g(0)$  and  $p | h(0)$ . But then  $p^2 | g(0)h(0) = f(0) = a_0$ , which is a contradiction.

# Euclidean Domains

Another important kind of integral domain is a Euclidean domain.

# Definition Euclidean Domain (ED)

An integral domain  $D$  is called a Euclidean domain if there is a function  $d$  (called the measure) from the nonzero elements of  $D$  to the nonnegative integers such that

1.  $d(a) \leq d(ab)$  for all nonzero  $a, b$  in  $D$ ; and  
2. if  $a, b \in D, b \neq 0$ , then there exist elements  $q$  and  $r$  in  $D$  such that  $a = bq + r$ , where  $r = 0$  or  $d(r) < d(b)$ .

EXAMPLE 5 The ring  $Z$  is a Euclidean domain with  $d(a) = |a|$  (the absolute value of  $a$ ).

EXAMPLE 6 Let  $F$  be a field. Then  $F[x]$  is a Euclidean domain with  $d(f(x)) = \deg f(x)$  (see Theorem 16.2).

Examples 5 and 6 illustrate just one of many similarities between the rings  $Z$  and  $F[x]$ . Additional similarities are summarized in Table 18.1.

EXAMPLE 7 The ring of Gaussian integers  $Z[i] = \{a + bi \mid a, b \in Z\}$  is a Euclidean domain with  $d(a + bi) = a^2 + b^2$ . Unlike the previous two examples, in this example the function  $d$  does not obviously satisfy the necessary conditions. That  $d(x) \leq d(xy)$  for  $x, y \in Z[i]$  follows directly from the fact that  $d(xy) = d(x)d(y)$  (Exercise 7). To verify that condition 2 holds, observe that if  $x, y \in Z[i]$  and  $y \neq 0$ , then  $xy^{-1} \in Q[i]$ , the field of quotients of  $Z[i]$  (Exercise 65 in Chapter 15). Say  $xy^{-1} = s + ti$ , where  $s, t \in Q$ . Now let  $m$  be the integer nearest  $s$ , and let  $n$  be the integer nearest  $t$ . (These integers may not be uniquely determined, but that does not matter.) Thus,  $|m - s| \leq 1/2$

and  $|n - t|\leq 1 / 2$  . Then

$$
\begin{array}{l} x y ^ {- 1} = s + t i = (m - m + s) + (n - n + t) i \\ = (m + n i) + [ (s - m) + (t - n) i ]. \\ \end{array}
$$

So,

$$
x = (m + n i) y + [ (s - m) + (t - n) i ] y.
$$

We claim that the division condition of the definition of a Euclidean domain is satisfied with  $q = m + ni$  and

$$
r = [ (s - m) + (t - n) i ] y.
$$

Clearly,  $q$  belongs to  $Z[i]$ , and since  $r = x - qy$ , so does  $r$ . Finally,

$$
\begin{array}{l} d (r) = d ([ (s - m) + (t - n) i ]) d (y) \\ = [ (s - m) ^ {2} + (t - n) ^ {2} ] d (y) \\ \leq \left(\frac {1}{4} + \frac {1}{4}\right) d (y) <   d (y). \\ \end{array}
$$

# Theorem 18.4 ED Implies PID

# Every Euclidean domain is a principal ideal domain.

PROOF Let  $D$  be a Euclidean domain and  $I$  a nonzero ideal of  $D$ . Among all the nonzero elements of  $I$ , let  $a$  be such that  $d(a)$  is a minimum. Then  $I = \langle a \rangle$ . For, if  $b \in I$ , there are elements  $q$  and  $r$  such that  $b = aq + r$ , where  $r = 0$  or  $d(r) < d(a)$ . But  $r = b - aq \in I$ , so  $d(r)$  cannot be less than  $d(a)$ . Thus,  $r = 0$  and  $b \in \langle a \rangle$ . Finally, the zero ideal is  $\langle 0 \rangle$ .

Although it is not easy to verify, we remark that there are principal ideal domains that are not Euclidean domains. The first such example was given by T. Motzkin in 1949.

As an immediate consequence of Theorems 18.3 and 18.4, we have the following important result.

# Corollary ED Implies UFD

# Every Euclidean domain is a unique factorization domain.

We may summarize our theorems and remarks as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \mathrm {E D} \Rightarrow \mathrm {P I D} \Rightarrow \mathrm {U F D}; \\ \mathrm {U F D} \not \Rightarrow \mathrm {P I D} \not \Rightarrow \mathrm {E D}. \\ \end{array}
$$

(You can remember these implications by listing the types alphabetically.)

In Chapter 17, we proved that  $Z[x]$  is a unique factorization domain. Since  $Z$  is a unique factorization domain, the next theorem is a broad generalization of this fact. The proof is similar to that of the special case, and we therefore omit it.

# Theorem 18.5  $D$  a UFD Implies  $D[x]$  a UFD

# If  $D$  is a unique factorization domain, then  $D[x]$  is a unique factorization domain.

We conclude this chapter with an example of an integral domain that is not a unique factorization domain.

EXAMPLE 8 The ring  $Z[\sqrt{-5}] = \{a + b\sqrt{-5} \mid a, b \in Z\}$  is an integral domain but not a unique factorization domain. It is straightforward that  $Z[\sqrt{-5}]$  is an integral domain (see Exercise 11 in Chapter 13). To verify that unique factorization does not hold, we mimic the method used in Example 1 with  $N(a + b\sqrt{-5}) = a^2 + 5b^2$ . Since  $N(xy) = N(x)N(y)$  and  $N(x) = 1$  if and only if  $x$  is a unit (see Exercise 1), it follows that the only units of  $Z[\sqrt{-5}]$  are  $\pm 1$ .

Now consider the following factorizations:

$$
\begin{array}{l} 4 6 = 2 \cdot 2 3, \\ 4 6 = (1 + 3 \sqrt {- 5}) (1 - 3 \sqrt {- 5}). \\ \end{array}
$$

We claim that each of these four factors is irreducible over  $Z[\sqrt{-5}]$ . Suppose that, say,  $2 = xy$ , where  $x, y \in Z[\sqrt{-5}]$  and neither is a unit. Then  $4 = N(2) = N(x)N(y)$  and, therefore,  $N(x) = N(y) = 2$ , which is impossible. Likewise, if  $23 = xy$  were a nontrivial factorization, then  $N(x) = 23$ . Thus, there would be integers  $a$  and  $b$  such that  $a^2 + 5b^2 = 23$ . Clearly, no such integers exist. The same argument applies to  $1 \pm 3\sqrt{-5}$ .

In light of Examples 7 and 8, one can't help but wonder for which  $d < 0$  is  $Z[\sqrt{d}]$  a unique factorization domain. The answer is only when  $d = -1$  or  $-2$ . The case where  $d = -1$  was first proved by Gauss.

SOPHIE GERMAIN was born in Paris on April 1, 1776. She educated herself by reading the works of Newton and Euler in Latin and the lecture notes of Lagrange. In 1804, Germain wrote to Gauss about her work in number theory but used the pseudonym Monsieur LeBlanc because she feared that Gauss would not take seriously the efforts of a woman. Gauss gave Germain's results high praise and a few years later, upon learning her true identity, wrote to her:

But how to describe to you my admiration and astonishment at seeing my esteemed correspondent Mr. LeBlanc metamorphose himself into this illustrious personage who gives such a brilliant example of what I would find it difficult to believe. A taste for

the abstract sciences in general and above all the mysteries of numbers is excessively rare: it is not a subject which strikes everyone; the enchanting charms of this sublime science reveal themselves only to those who have the courage to go deeply into it. But when a person of the sex which, according to our customs and prejudices, must encounter infinitely more difficulties than men to familiarize herself with these thorny researches, succeeds nevertheless in surmounting these obstacles and penetrating the most obscure parts of them, then without doubt she must have the noblest courage, quite extraordinary talents, and a superior genius.[2]

Germain is best known for her work on Fermat's Last Theorem. She died on June 27, 1831, in Paris.

Postage stamp issued by the Czech Republic in honor of Fermat's Last Theorem.

IN 1993, ANDREW WILES of Princeton electrified the mathematics community by announcing that he had proved Fermat's Last Theorem after seven years of effort. His proof, which ran 200 pages, relied heavily on ring theory and group theory. Because of Wiles's solid reputation and because his approach was based on deep results that had already shed much light on the problem, many experts in the field believed that Wiles had succeeded where so many others had failed. Wiles's achievement was reported in newspapers and magazines around the world. The New York Times ran a front-page story on it, and one TV network announced it on the evening news. Wiles even made People magazine's list of the 25 most intriguing people of 1993! In San Francisco a group of mathematicians

rented a 1200-seat movie theater and sold tickets for  $5.00 each for public lectures on the proof. Scalpers received as much as$ 25.00 a ticket for the sold-out event.

The bubble soon burst when experts had an opportunity to scrutinize Wiles's manuscript. By December, Wiles released a statement saying he was working to resolve a gap in the proof. In September of 1994, a paper by Wiles and Richard Taylor, a former student of his, circumvented the gap in the original proof. Since then, many experts have checked the proof and have found no errors. One mathematician was quoted as saying, "The exuberance is back." In 1997, Wiles's proof was the subject of a PBS Nova program.

Wiles was born in 1953 in Cambridge, England. He obtained his bachelor's degree at Oxford and his doctoral degree at Cambridge University in 1980. In 2011 he rejoined Oxford. Among his many high honors are the Cole Prize, the Fermat Prize, the Abel Prize, the Copley Medal, and a knighthood. In 2018 he was the first person ever appointed as a Regius Professor of Mathematics at Oxford.

PIERRE DE FERMAT (pronounced Fair-mah) was born in Beaumont-de-Lomagne, France in August of 1601 and died in 1665. Fermat obtained a Bachelor's degree in civil law from the University of Orleans in 1631. While earning his living practicing law he did mathematics as a hobby. Rather than proving and publishing theorems he sent the statements of his results and questions to leading mathematicians. One of his important observations is that any prime of the form  $4k + 1$  can be written as the sum of two squares in one and only one way, whereas a prime of the form  $4k - 1$  cannot be written as the sum of two squares in any manner whatever. Mathematics historian William Dunham asserts that Fermat's discovery of this dichotomy among primes ranks as one of the landmarks of number theory.

Addressing Fermat's contributions to number theory André Weil wrote that "...what we possess of his methods for dealing with curves of genus 1 is remarkably coherent; it is still the foundation for the modern theory of such curves." A Wikipedia article on Fermat concluded with the statement "Fermat essentially created the modern theory of numbers." Beyond his contributions to number theory, Fermat found a law of optics and is considered as one of the founders of analytic geometry and probability theory. In 1989 the Institut de Mathétiques de Toulouse in France established the Fermat prize for research in fields in which Fermat made majors contributions. Among the recipients are Andrew Wiles and Richard Taylor.

# Extension Fields

Viewed with perfect hindsight, there were many occasions during the history of algebra when new number systems had to be created, or constructed, in order to provide roots for certain polynomials.

Norman J. Block, Abstract Algebra with Applications

In many respects this [Kronecker's Theorem] is the fundamental theorem of algebra.

# The Fundamental Theorem of Field Theory

In our work on rings, we came across a number of fields, both finite and infinite. Indeed, we saw that  $Z_{3}[x] / \langle x^{2} + 1\rangle$  is a field of order 9, whereas  $\mathbf{R}[x] / \langle x^2 +1\rangle$  is a field isomorphic to the complex numbers. In the next three chapters, we take up, in a systematic way, the subject of fields.

# Definition Extension Field

A field  $E$  is an extension field of a field  $F$  if  $F \subseteq E$  and the operations of  $F$  are those of  $E$  restricted to  $F$ .

Cauchy's observation in 1847 that  $\mathbf{R}[x] / \langle x^2 + 1 \rangle$  is a field that contains a zero of  $x^2 + 1$  prepared the way for the following sweeping generalization of that fact.

# Theorem 19.1 Fundamental Theorem of Field Theory (Kronecker's Theorem, 1887)

Let  $F$  be a field and let  $f(x)$  be a nonconstant polynomial in  $F[x]$ . Then there is an extension field  $E$  of  $F$  in which  $f(x)$  has a zero.

PROOF Since  $F[x]$  is a unique factorization domain,  $f(x)$  has an irreducible factor, say,  $p(x)$ . Clearly, it suffices to construct an extension field  $E$  of  $F$  in which  $p(x)$  has a zero. Our candidate for  $E$  is  $F[x] / \langle p(x) \rangle$ . We already know that this is a field from Corollary 1 of Theorem 17.5. Also, since the mapping of  $\phi \colon F \to E$  given by  $\phi(a) = a + \langle p(x) \rangle$  is one-to-one and preserves both operations,  $E$  has a subfield isomorphic to  $F$ . We may think of  $E$  as containing  $F$  if we simply identify the coset  $a + \langle p(x) \rangle$  with its unique coset representative  $a$  that belongs to  $F$  [i.e., think of  $a + \langle p(x) \rangle$  as just  $a$  and vice versa; see Exercise 41 in Chapter 17].

Finally, to show that  $p(x)$  has a zero in  $E$ , write

$$
p (x) = a _ {n} x ^ {n} + a _ {n - 1} x ^ {n - 1} + \dots + a _ {0}.
$$

Then, in  $E, x + \langle p(x) \rangle$  is a zero of  $p(x)$ , because

$$
\begin{array}{l} p (x + \langle p (x) \rangle) = a _ {n} (x + \langle p (x) \rangle) ^ {n} + a _ {n - 1} (x + \langle p (x) \rangle) ^ {n - 1} + \dots + a _ {0} \\ = a _ {n} \left(x ^ {n} + \langle p (x) \rangle\right) + a _ {n - 1} \left(x ^ {n - 1} + \langle p (x) \rangle\right) + \dots + a _ {0} \\ = a _ {n} x ^ {n} + a _ {n - 1} x ^ {n - 1} + \dots + a _ {0} + \langle p (x) \rangle \\ = p (x) + \langle p (x) \rangle = 0 + \langle p (x) \rangle . \\ \end{array}
$$

EXAMPLE 1 Let  $f(x) = x^{2} + 1 \in Q[x]$ . Then, viewing  $f(x)$  as an element of  $E[x] = (Q[x] / \langle x^{2} + 1 \rangle)[x]$ , we have

$$
\begin{array}{l} f (x + \langle x ^ {2} + 1 \rangle) = (x + \langle x ^ {2} + 1 \rangle) ^ {2} + 1 \\ = x ^ {2} + \langle x ^ {2} + 1 \rangle + 1 \\ = x ^ {2} + 1 + \langle x ^ {2} + 1 \rangle \\ = 0 + \langle x ^ {2} + 1 \rangle . \\ \end{array}
$$

Of course, the polynomial  $x^{2} + 1$  has the complex number  $\sqrt{-1}$  as a zero, but the point we wish to emphasize here is that we have constructed a field that contains the rational numbers and a zero for the polynomial  $x^{2} + 1$  by using only the rational numbers. No knowledge of complex numbers is necessary. Our method utilizes only the field we are given.

EXAMPLE 2 Let  $f(x) = x^{5} + 2x^{2} + 2x + 2 \in Z_{3}[x]$ . Then, the irreducible factorization of  $f(x)$  over  $Z_{3}$  is  $(x^{2} + 1)(x^{3} + 2x + 2)$ . So, to find an extension  $E$  of  $Z_{3}$  in which  $f(x)$  has a zero, we may take  $E = Z_{3}[x] / \langle x^{2} + 1 \rangle$ , a field with nine elements, or  $E = Z_{3}[x] / \langle x^{3} + 2x + 2 \rangle$ , a field with 27 elements.

Since every integral domain is contained in its field of quotients (Theorem 15.6), we see that every nonconstant polynomial with coefficients from an integral domain always has a zero in some field containing the ring of coefficients. The next example shows that this is not true for commutative rings in general.

EXAMPLE 3 Let  $f(x) = 2x + 1 \in Z_4[x]$ . Then  $f(x)$  has no zero in any ring containing  $Z_4$  as a subring, because if  $\beta$  were a zero in such a ring, then  $0 = 2\beta + 1$ , and therefore  $0 = 2(2\beta + 1) = 2(2\beta) + 2 = (2 \cdot 2)\beta + 2 = 0 \cdot \beta + 2 = 2$ . But  $0 \neq 2$  in  $Z_4$ .

# Splitting Fields

To motivate the next definition and theorem, let's return to Example 1 for a moment. For notational convenience, in  $F = Q[x] / \langle x^2 + 1 \rangle$ , let  $\alpha$  be the element  $x + \langle x^2 + 1 \rangle$  in  $F$ , and for any  $a \in Q$ , we denote the coset  $a + \langle x^2 + 1 \rangle$  by  $a$ . Then, because both  $\alpha$  and  $-\alpha$  are zeros of the polynomial  $x^2 + 1$  in  $F$  it

should be the case that  $x^{2} + 1$  factors as  $(x - \alpha)(x + \alpha)$  in  $F$ . To see this, note that  $\alpha^2 = (x + \langle x^2 + 1 \rangle)^2 = x^2 + \langle x^2 + 1 \rangle = x^2 + (1 - 1) + \langle x^2 + 1 \rangle = x^2 + 1 - 1 + \langle x^2 + 1 \rangle = -1 + \langle x^2 + 1 \rangle = -1$ . So, in  $F$ ,  $(x - \alpha)(x + \alpha) = x^2 - \alpha^2 = x^2 + 1$ . This shows that  $x^2 + 1$  can be written as a product of linear factors in some extension of  $Q$ . That was easy and you might argue coincidental. The polynomial given in Example 2 presents a greater challenge. Is there an extension of  $Z_3$  in which that polynomial factors as a product of linear factors? Yes, there is. But first some notation and a definition.

Let  $F$  be a field and let  $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$  be elements of some extension  $E$  of  $F$ . We use  $F(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)$  to denote the smallest subfield of  $E$  that contains  $F$  and the set  $\{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\}$ . We leave it as an exercise (Exercise 37) to show that  $F(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)$  is the intersection of all subfields of  $E$  that contain  $F$  and the set  $\{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\}$ . That is, if  $K$  is any field that contains  $F$  and the set  $\{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\}$  then  $K$  contains  $F(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)$ .

# Definitions Splitting Field

Let  $E$  be an extension field of  $F$  and let  $f(x) \in F[x]$  with degree at least 1. We say that  $f(x)$  splits in  $E$  if there are elements  $a \in F$  and  $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \in E$  such that

$$
f (x) = a \left(x - a _ {1}\right) \left(x - a _ {2}\right) \dots \left(x - a _ {n}\right).
$$

We call  $E$  a splitting field for  $f(x)$  over  $F$  if  $E = F(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n})$ .

Note that a splitting field of a polynomial over a field depends not only on the polynomial but on the field as well. Indeed, a splitting field of  $f(x)$  over  $F$  is just a smallest extension field of  $F$  in which  $f(x)$  splits. The next example illustrates how a splitting field of a polynomial  $f(x)$  over field  $F$  depends on  $F$ .

EXAMPLE 4 Consider the polynomial  $f(x) = x^{2} + 1 \in Q[x]$ . Since  $x^{2} + 1 = (x + \sqrt{-1})(x - \sqrt{-1})$ , we see that  $f(x)$  splits in  $\mathbf{C}$ , but a splitting field over  $Q$  is  $Q(i) = \{r + si \mid r, s \in Q\}$ . A splitting field for  $x^{2} + 1$  over  $\mathbf{R}$  is  $\mathbf{C}$ . Likewise,  $x^{2} - 2 \in Q[x]$  splits in  $\mathbf{R}$ , but a splitting field over  $Q$  is  $Q(\sqrt{2}) = \{r + s\sqrt{2} \mid r, s \in Q\}$ .

There is a useful analogy between the definition of a splitting field and the definition of an irreducible polynomial. Just as it makes no sense to say "  $f(x)$  is irreducible," it makes no sense to say "  $E$  is a splitting field for  $f(x)$ ." In each case, the underlying field must be specified; that is, one must say "  $f(x)$  is irreducible over  $F$ " and "  $E$  is a splitting field for  $f(x)$  over  $F$ ."

Our notation in Example 4 appears to be inconsistent with the notation that we used in earlier chapters. For example, we denoted the set  $\{a + b\sqrt{2} \mid a, b \in Z\}$  by  $Z[\sqrt{2}]$  and the set  $\{a + b\sqrt{2} \mid a, b \in Q\}$  by  $Q(\sqrt{2})$ . The difference is that  $Z[\sqrt{2}]$  is merely a ring, whereas  $Q(\sqrt{2})$  is a field. In general, parentheses are used when one wishes to indicate that the set is a field, although no harm would be done by using, say,  $Q[\sqrt{2}]$  to denote  $\{a + b\sqrt{2} \mid a, b \in Q\}$  if we were concerned with its ring properties only. Using parentheses rather than brackets simply conveys a bit more information about the set.

# Theorem 19.2 Existence of Splitting Fields

Let  $F$  be a field and let  $f(x)$  be a nonconstant element of  $F[x]$ . Then there exists a splitting field  $E$  for  $f(x)$  over  $F$ .

PROOF We proceed by induction on  $\deg f(x)$ . If  $\deg f(x) = 1$ , then  $f(x)$  is linear. Now suppose that the statement is true for all fields and all polynomials of degree less than that of  $f(x)$ . By Theorem 19.1, there is an extension  $E$  of  $F$  in which  $f(x)$  has a zero, say,  $a_1$ . Then we may write  $f(x) = (x - a_1)g(x)$  where  $g(x) \in E[x]$ . Since  $\deg g(x) < \deg f(x)$ , by induction, there is a field  $K$  that contains  $E$  and all the zeros of  $g(x)$ , say,  $a_2, \ldots, a_n$ . Clearly, then, a splitting field for  $f(x)$  over  $F$  is  $F(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)$ .

EXAMPLE 5 Consider

$$
f (x) = x ^ {4} - x ^ {2} - 2 = (x ^ {2} - 2) (x ^ {2} + 1)
$$

over  $Q$ . Obviously, the zeros of  $f(x)$  in  $\mathbf{C}$  are  $\pm \sqrt{2}$  and  $\pm i$ . So a splitting field for  $f(x)$  over  $Q$  is

$$
\begin{array}{l} Q (\sqrt {2}, i) = Q (\sqrt {2}) (i) = \left\{\alpha + \beta i \mid \alpha , \beta \in Q (\sqrt {2}) \right\} \\ = \left\{\left(a + b \sqrt {2}\right) + \left(c + d \sqrt {2}\right) i \mid a, b, c, d \in Q \right\}. \\ \end{array}
$$

EXAMPLE 6 Consider  $f(x) = x^{2} + x + 2$  over  $Z_{3}$ . Then  $Z_{3}(i) = \{a + bi \mid a, b \in Z_{3}\}$  (see Example 9 in Chapter 13) is a splitting field for  $f(x)$  over  $Z_{3}$  because

$$
f (x) = (x - (1 + i)) (x - (1 - i)).
$$

At the same time, we know by the proof of Kronecker's Theorem that the element  $x + \langle x^2 + x + 2 \rangle$  of

$$
F = Z _ {3} [ x ] / \langle x ^ {2} + x + 2 \rangle
$$

is a zero of  $f(x)$ . Since  $f(x)$  has degree 2, it follows from the Factor Theorem (Corollary 2 of Theorem 16.2) that the other zero of  $f(x)$  must also be in  $F$ . Thus,  $f(x)$  splits in  $F$ , and because  $F$  is a two-dimensional vector space over  $Z_{3}$ , we know that  $F$  is also a splitting field of  $f(x)$  over  $Z_{3}$ . But how do we factor  $f(x)$  in  $F$ ? Factoring  $f(x)$  in  $F$  is confusing because we are using the symbol  $x$  in two distinct ways: It is used as a placeholder to write the polynomial  $f(x)$ , and it is used to create the coset representatives of the elements of  $F$ . This confusion can be avoided by simply identifying the coset  $1 + \langle x^{2} + x + 2 \rangle$  with the element 1 in  $Z_{3}$  and denoting the coset  $x + \langle x^{2} + x + 2 \rangle$  by  $\beta$ . With this identification, the field  $Z_{3}[x] / \langle x^{2} + x + 2 \rangle$  can be represented as  $\{0, 1, 2, \beta, 2\beta, \beta + 1, 2\beta + 1, \beta + 2, 2\beta + 2\}$ . These elements are added and multiplied just as polynomials are, except that we use the

observation that  $x^{2} + x + 2 + \langle x^{2} + x + 2\rangle = 0$  implies that  $\beta^2 +\beta +2 = 0$ , so that  $\beta^2 = -\beta -2 = 2\beta +1$ . For example,  $(2\beta +1)(\beta +2) = 2\beta^2 +5\beta +2 = 2(2\beta +1) + 5\beta +2 = 9\beta +4 = 1$ . To obtain the factorization of  $f(x)$  in  $F$ , we simply long divide, as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{l} \begin{array}{c} x + (\beta + 1) \\ x - \beta) x ^ {2} + x + 2 \end{array} \\ \begin{array}{c} x ^ {2} - \beta x \\ \hline (\beta + 1) x + 2 \end{array} \\ (\beta + 1) x - (\beta + 1) \beta \\ (\beta + 1) \beta + 2 = \beta^ {2} + \beta + 2 = 0. \\ \end{array}
$$

So,  $x^{2} + x + 2 = (x - \beta)(x + \beta + 1)$ . Thus, we have found two splitting fields for  $x^{2} + x + 2$  over  $Z_{3}$ , one of the form  $F(a)$  and one of the form  $F[x] / \langle p(x) \rangle$  [where  $F = Z_{3}$  and  $p(x) = x^{2} + x + 2$ ].

The next theorem shows how the fields  $F(a)$  and  $F[x] / \langle p(x) \rangle$  are related in the case where  $p(x)$  is irreducible over  $F$  and  $a$  is a zero of  $p(x)$  in some extension of  $F$ .

# Theorem 19.3  $F(a)\approx F[x] / \langle p(x)\rangle$

Let  $F$  be a field and let  $p(x) \in F[x]$  be irreducible over  $F$ . If  $a$  is a zero of  $p(x)$  in some extension  $E$  of  $F$ , then  $F(a)$  is isomorphic to  $F[x] / \langle p(x) \rangle$ . Furthermore, if  $\deg p(x) = n$ , then every member of  $F(a)$  can be uniquely expressed in the form

$$
c _ {n - 1} a ^ {n - 1} + c _ {n - 2} a ^ {n - 2} + \dots + c _ {1} a + c _ {0},
$$

where  $c_{0}, c_{1}, \ldots, c_{n-1} \in F$ .

PROOF Consider the function  $\phi$  from  $F[x]$  to  $F(a)$  given by  $\phi(f(x)) = f(a)$ . Clearly,  $\phi$  is a ring homomorphism. We claim that  $\operatorname{Ker} \phi = \langle p(x) \rangle$ . (This is Exercise 39 in Chapter 17.) Since  $p(a) = 0$ , we have  $\langle p(x) \rangle \subseteq \operatorname{Ker} \phi$ . On the other hand, we know by Theorem 17.5 that  $\langle p(x) \rangle$  is a maximal ideal in  $F[x]$ . So, because  $\operatorname{Ker} \phi \neq F[x]$  [it does not contain the constant polynomial  $f(x) = 1$ ], we have  $\operatorname{Ker} \phi = \langle p(x) \rangle$ . At this point it follows from the First Isomorphism Theorem for Rings and Corollary 1 of Theorem 17.5 that  $\phi(F[x])$  is a subfield of  $F(a)$ . Noting that  $\phi(F[x])$  contains both  $F$  and  $a$  and recalling that  $F(a)$  is the smallest such field, we have  $F[x] / \langle p(x) \rangle \approx \phi(F[x]) = F(a)$ .

The final assertion of the theorem follows from the fact that every element of  $F[x] / \langle p(x) \rangle$  can be expressed uniquely in the form

$$
c _ {n - 1} x ^ {n - 1} + \dots + c _ {0} + \langle p (x) \rangle ,
$$

where  $c_0, \ldots, c_{n-1} \in F$  (see Exercise 47 in Chapter 16), and the natural isomorphism from  $F[x] / \langle p(x) \rangle$  to  $F(a)$  carries  $c_k x^k + \langle p(x) \rangle$  to  $c_k a^k$ .

As an immediate corollary of Theorem 19.3, we have the following attractive result.

# Corollary  $F(a)\approx F(b)$

Let  $F$  be a field and let  $p(x) \in F[x]$  be irreducible over  $F$ . If  $a$  is a zero of  $p(x)$  in some extension  $E$  of  $F$  and  $b$  is a zero of  $p(x)$  in some extension  $E'$  of  $F$ , then the fields  $F(a)$  and  $F(b)$  are isomorphic.

PROOF From Theorem 19.3, we have  $F(a) \approx F[x] / \langle p(x) \rangle \approx F(b)$ .

EXAMPLE 7 Just for fun, let's write  $f(x) = x^3 + x^2 + 1$  as a product of linear factors in  $E = Z_2[x] / \langle x^3 + x^2 + 1 \rangle$ . By Kronecker's Theorem, we know that  $f(x)$  has a zero in  $E$  call it  $a$ . Then, by Theorem 19.3, we know that  $E = \{0, 1, a, a + 1, a^2, a^2 + 1, a^2 + a, a^2 + a + 1\}$ , and we perform multiplication by using  $a^3 = a^2 + 1$  (here we use that  $-1 = 1$ ). To find the other two zeros of  $f(x)$ , we can just try the elements of  $E$  one by one. Doing so, we obtain  $a, a^2$ , and  $a^2 + 1$ . So,  $f(x) = (x + a)(x + a^2)(x + a^2 + 1)$ .

Recall that a basis for an  $n$ -dimensional vector space over a field  $F$  is a set of  $n$  vectors  $v_{1}, v_{2}, \ldots, v_{n}$  with the property that every member of the vector space can be expressed uniquely in the form  $a_{1}v_{1} + a_{2}v_{2} + \dots + a_{n}v_{n}$ , where the  $a$ 's belong to  $F$ . So, in the language of vector spaces, the latter portion of Theorem 19.3 says that if  $a$  is a zero of an irreducible polynomial over  $F$  of degree  $n$ , then the set  $\{1, a, \ldots, a^{n-1}\}$  is a basis for  $F(a)$  over  $F$ .

Theorem 19.3 often provides a convenient way of describing the elements of a field.

EXAMPLE 8 Consider the irreducible polynomial  $f(x) = x^6 - 2$  over  $Q$ . Since  $\sqrt[6]{2}$  is a zero of  $f(x)$ , we know from Theorem 19.3 that the set  $\{1, 2^{1/6}, 2^{2/6}, 2^{3/6}, 2^{4/6}, 2^{5/6}\}$  is a basis for  $Q(\sqrt[6]{2})$  over  $Q$ . Thus,

$$
Q (\sqrt [ 6 ]{2}) = \left\{a _ {0} + a _ {1} 2 ^ {1 / 6} + a _ {2} 2 ^ {2 / 6} + a _ {3} 2 ^ {3 / 6} + a _ {4} 2 ^ {4 / 6} + a _ {5} 2 ^ {5 / 6} \mid a _ {i} \in Q \right\}.
$$

This field is isomorphic to  $Q[x] / \langle x^6 - 2 \rangle$ .

Theorem 19.3 provides us with two ways to look at fields constructed by extending a field  $F$  to a larger one that has the zero of a polynomial  $p(x)$  of degree  $n$  that is irreducible over  $F$ . Generally speaking, we use the generic approach  $F[x] / \langle p(x) \rangle$  to do theoretical things such as proving existence and uniqueness of splitting fields and we use  $F(a) = \{c_{n-1}a^{n-1} + c_{n-2}x^{n-2} + \dots + c_1x + c_0 \mid c_0, c_1, \ldots, c_{n-1} \in F\}$  when we have a specific polynomial as in Example 7. The latter is more concrete and is notationally more convenient. We will choose between them depending on the circumstances.

In 1882, Ferdinand von Lindemann (1852-1939) proved that  $\pi$  is not the zero of any polynomial in  $Q[x]$ . Because of this important result, Theorem 19.3 does not apply to  $Q(\pi)$  (see Exercise 11). Fields of the form  $F(a)$  where  $a$  is in some extension field of  $F$  but not the zero of an element of  $F(x)$  are discussed in the next chapter.

In Example 6, we produced two splitting fields for the polynomial  $x^{2} + x + 2$  over  $Z_{3}$ . Likewise, it is an easy exercise to show that both  $Q[x] / \langle x^{2} + 1 \rangle$  and

$Q(i) = \{r + si \mid r, s \in Q\}$  are splitting fields of the polynomial  $x^2 + 1$  over  $Q$ . But are these different-looking splitting fields algebraically different? Not really. We conclude our discussion of splitting fields by proving that splitting fields are unique up to isomorphism. To make it easier to apply induction, we will prove a more general result.

We begin by observing first that any ring isomorphism  $\phi$  from  $F$  to  $F'$  has a natural extension from  $F[x]$  to  $F'[x]$  given by  $c_n x^n + c_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \dots + c_1 x + c_0 \to \phi(c_n) x^n + \phi(c_{n-1}) x^{n-1} + \dots + \phi(c_1) x + \phi(c_0)$ . Since this mapping agrees with  $\phi$  on  $F$ , it is convenient and natural to use  $\phi$  to denote this mapping as well.

# Lemma

Let  $F$  be a field, let  $p(x) \in F[x]$  be irreducible over  $F$ , and let  $a$  be a zero of  $p(x)$  in some extension of  $F$ . If  $\phi$  is a field isomorphism from  $F$  to  $F'$  and  $b$  is a zero of  $\phi(p(x))$  in some extension of  $F'$ , then there is an isomorphism from  $F(a)$  to  $F'(b)$  that agrees with  $\phi$  on  $F$  and carries  $a$  to  $b$ .

PROOF First observe that since  $p(x)$  is irreducible over  $F$ ,  $\phi(p(x))$  is irreducible over  $F'$ . It is straightforward to check that the mapping from  $F[x] / \langle p(x) \rangle$  to  $F'[x] / \langle \phi(p(x)) \rangle$  given by

$$
f (x) + \langle p (x) \rangle \rightarrow \phi (f (x)) + \langle \phi (p (x)) \rangle
$$

is a field isomorphism. By a slight abuse of notation, we denote this mapping by  $\phi$  also. (If you object, put a bar over the  $\phi$ .) From the proof of Theorem 19.3, we know that there is an isomorphism  $\alpha$  from  $F(a)$  to  $F[x] / \langle p(x) \rangle$  that is the identity on  $F$  and carries  $a$  to  $x + \langle p(x) \rangle$ . Similarly, there is an isomorphism  $\beta$  from  $F'[x] / \langle \phi(p(x)) \rangle$  to  $F'(b)$  that is the identity on  $F'$  and carries  $x + \langle \phi(p(x)) \rangle$  to  $b$ . Thus,  $\beta \phi \alpha$  is the desired mapping from  $F(a)$  to  $F'(b)$ . See Figure 19.1.

Figure 19.1 The mapping  $\beta \phi \alpha$

Let  $\phi$  be an isomorphism from a field  $F$  to a field  $F'$  and let  $f(x) \in F[x]$ . If  $E$  is a splitting field for  $f(x)$  over  $F$  and  $E'$  is a splitting field for  $\phi(f(x))$  over  $F'$ , then there is an isomorphism from  $E$  to  $E'$  that agrees with  $\phi$  on  $F$ .

PROOF We use induction on  $\deg f(x)$ . If  $\deg f(x) = 1$ , then  $E = F$  and  $E' = F'$ , so that  $\phi$  itself is the desired mapping. If  $\deg f(x) > 1$ , let  $p(x)$  be an irreducible factor of  $f(x)$ , let  $a$  be a zero of  $p(x)$  in  $E$ , and let  $b$  be a zero of  $\phi(p(x))$  in  $E'$ . By the preceding lemma, there is an isomorphism  $\alpha$  from  $F(a)$  to  $F'(b)$  that agrees with  $\phi$  on  $F$  and carries  $a$  to  $b$ . Now write  $f(x) = (x - a)g(x)$ , where  $g(x) \in F(a)[x]$ . Then  $E$  is a splitting field for  $g(x)$  over  $F(a)$  and  $E'$  is a splitting field for  $\alpha(g(x))$  over  $F'(b)$ . Since  $\deg g(x) < \deg f(x)$ , there is an isomorphism from  $E$  to  $E'$  that agrees with  $\alpha$  on  $F(a)$  and therefore with  $\phi$  on  $F$ .

# Corollary Splitting Fields Are Unique

Let  $F$  be a field and let  $f(x) \in F[x]$ . Then any two splitting fields of  $f(x)$  over  $F$  are isomorphic.

PROOF Suppose that  $E$  and  $E'$  are splitting fields of  $f(x)$  over  $F$ . The result follows immediately from Theorem 19.4 by letting  $\phi$  be the identity from  $F$  to  $F$ .

In light of the corollary above, we may refer to "the" splitting field of a polynomial over  $F$  without ambiguity.

Even though  $x^6 - 2$  has a zero in  $Q(\sqrt[6]{2})$ , it does not split in  $Q(\sqrt[6]{2})$ . The splitting field is easy to obtain, however.

# EXAMPLE 9 The Splitting Field of  $x^n - a$  over  $Q$

Let  $a$  be a positive rational number and let  $\omega$  be a primitive  $n$ th root of unity (see Example 2 in Chapter 16). Then each of

$$
a ^ {1 / n}, \omega a ^ {1 / n}, \omega^ {2} a ^ {1 / n}, \dots , \omega^ {n - 1} a ^ {1 / n}
$$

is a zero of  $x^n -a$  in  $Q(\sqrt[n]{a},\omega)$

# Zeros of an Irreducible Polynomial

Now that we know that every nonconstant polynomial over a field splits in some extension, we ask whether irreducible polynomials must split in some special way. Yes, they do. To discover how, we borrow something whose origins are in calculus.

# Definition Derivative

Let  $f(x) = a_{n}x^{n} + a_{n - 1}x^{n - 1} + \dots +a_{1}x + a_{0}$  belong to  $F[x]$ . The derivative of  $f(x)$ , denoted by  $f^{\prime}(x)$ , is the polynomial  $na_{n}x^{n - 1} + (n - 1)a_{n - 1}x^{n - 2} + \dots +a_{1}$  in  $F[x]$ .

Notice that our definition does not involve the notion of a limit. The standard rules for handling sums and products of functions in calculus carry over to arbitrary fields as well.

# Lemma Properties of the Derivative

Let  $f(x)$  and  $g(x) \in F[x]$  and let  $a \in F$ . Then

1.  $(f(x) + g(x))' = f'(x) + g'(x)$ .  
2.  $(af(x))' = af'(x)$  
3.  $(f(x)g(x))' = f(x)g'(x) + g(x)f'(x)$ .

PROOF Properties 1 and 2 follow from straightforward applications of the definition. Using property 1 and induction on  $\deg f(x)$ , property 3 reduces to the special case in which  $f(x) = a_{n}x^{n}$ . This also follows directly from the definition.

Before addressing the question of the nature of the zeros of an irreducible polynomial, we establish a general result concerning zeros of multiplicity greater than 1. Such zeros are called multiple zeros.

# Theorem 19.5 Criterion for Multiple Zeros

A polynomial  $f(x)$  over a field  $F$  has a multiple zero in some extension  $E$  if and only if  $f(x)$  and  $f'(x)$  have a common factor of positive degree in  $F[x]$ .

PROOF If  $a$  is a multiple zero of  $f(x)$  in some extension  $E$ , then there is a  $g(x)$  in  $E[x]$  such that  $f(x) = (x - a)^2 g(x)$ . Since  $f'(x) = (x - a)^2 g'(x) + 2(x - a)g(x)$ , we see that  $f'(a) = 0$ . Thus,  $x - a$  is a factor of both  $f(x)$  and  $f'(x)$  in the extension  $E$  of  $F$ . Now if  $f(x)$  and  $f'(x)$  have no common divisor of positive degree in  $F[x]$ , there are polynomials  $h(x)$  and  $k(x)$  in  $F[x]$  such that  $f(x)h(x) + f'(x)k(x) = 1$  (see Exercise 43 in Chapter 16). Viewing  $f(x)h(x) + f'(x)k(x)$  as an element of  $E[x]$ , we see also that  $x - a$  is a factor of 1. Since this is nonsense,  $f(x)$  and  $f'(x)$  must have a common divisor of positive degree in  $F[x]$ .

Conversely, suppose that  $f(x)$  and  $f'(x)$  have a common factor of positive degree in  $F[x]$ . Let  $a$  be a zero of the common factor. Then  $a$  is a zero of  $f(x)$  and  $f'(x)$ . Since  $a$  is a zero of  $f(x)$ , there is a polynomial  $q(x)$  such that  $f(x) = (x - a)q(x)$ . Then  $f'(x) = (x - a)q'(x) + q(x)$  and  $0 = f'(a) = q(a)$ . Thus,  $x - a$  is a factor of  $q(x)$  and  $a$  is a multiple zero of  $f(x)$ .

As an immediate corollary of the proof of Theorem 19.5 we have the following.

# Corollary

Let  $f(x)$  be a polynomial over a field  $F$ . If  $a$  is a zero of  $f(x)$  and  $f'(x)$  in some extension field of  $F$ , then  $a$  is a multiple zero of  $f(x)$ .

EXAMPLE 10 The polynomial  $f(x) = x^9 + x + 3$  has 1 as a multiple zero in  $Z_5[x]$ , whereas 1 is only a single zero in  $Z_5$  of  $x^9 + 2x + 2$ .

# Theorem 19.6 Multiple Zeros of an Irreducible

Let  $f(x)$  be an irreducible polynomial over a field  $F$ . If  $F$  has characteristic 0, then  $f(x)$  has no multiple zeros. If  $F$  has characteristic  $p \neq 0$ , then  $f(x)$  has a multiple zero only if it is of the form  $f(x) = g(x^p)$  for some  $g(x)$  in  $F[x]$ .

PROOF If  $f(x)$  has a multiple zero, then, by Theorem 19.5,  $f(x)$  and  $f'(x)$  have a common divisor of positive degree in  $F[x]$ . Since the only divisor of positive degree of  $f(x)$  in  $F[x]$  is  $f(x)$  itself (up to associates), we see that  $f(x)$  divides  $f'(x)$ . Because a polynomial over a field cannot divide a polynomial of smaller degree, we must have  $f'(x) = 0$ .

Now what does it mean to say that  $f'(x) = 0$ ? If we write  $f(x) = a_{n}x^{n} + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \dots + a_{1}x + a_{0}$ , then  $f'(x) = na_{n}x^{n-1} + (n-1)a_{n-1}x^{n-2} + \dots + a_{1}$ . Thus,  $f'(x) = 0$  only when  $ka_{k} = 0$  for  $k = 1, \ldots, n$ .

So, when  $\operatorname{char} F = 0$ , we have  $f(x) = a_0$ , which is not an irreducible polynomial. This contradicts the hypothesis that  $f(x)$  is irreducible over  $F$ . Thus,  $f(x)$  has no multiple zeros.

When  $\operatorname{char} F = p \neq 0$ , we have  $a_k = 0$  when  $p$  does not divide  $k$ . Thus, the only powers of  $x$  that appear in the sum  $a_n x^n + \dots + a_1 x + a_0$  are those of the form  $x^{pj} = (x^p)^j$ . It follows that  $f(x) = g(x^p)$  for some  $g(x) \in F[x]$ . [For example, if  $f(x) = x^{4p} + 3x^{2p} + x^p + 1$ , then  $g(x) = x^4 + 3x^2 + x + 1$ .]

Theorem 19.6 shows that an irreducible polynomial over a field of characteristic 0 cannot have multiple zeros. The desire to extend this result to a larger class of fields motivates the following definition.

# Definition Perfect Field

A field  $F$  is called perfect if  $F$  has characteristic 0 or if  $F$  has characteristic  $p$  and  $F^p = \{a^p \mid a \in F\} = F$ .

The most important family of perfect fields of characteristic  $p$  is the finite fields.

# Theorem 19.7 Finite Fields Are Perfect

# Every finite field is perfect.

PROOF Let  $F$  be a finite field of characteristic  $p$ . Consider the mapping  $\phi$  from  $F$  to  $F$  defined by  $\phi(x) = x^p$  for all  $x \in F$ . We claim that  $\phi$  is a field automorphism. Obviously,  $\phi(ab) = (ab)^p = a^p b^p = \phi(a)\phi(b)$ . Moreover,  $\phi(a + b) = (a + b)^p = a^p + \binom{p}{1}a^{p-1}b + \binom{p}{2}a^{p-2}b^2 + \cdots + \binom{p}{p-1}ab^{p-1} + b^p = a^p + b^p$ , since each  $\binom{p}{i}$  is divisible by  $p$ . Finally, since  $x^p \neq 0$  when  $x \neq 0$ ,  $\operatorname{Ker} \phi = \{0\}$ . Thus,  $\phi$  is one-to-one and, since  $F$  is finite,  $\phi$  is onto. This proves that  $F^p = F$ .

# Theorem 19.8 Criterion for No Multiple Zeros

If  $f(x)$  is an irreducible polynomial over a perfect field  $F$ , then  $f(x)$  has no multiple zeros.

PROOF The case where  $F$  has characteristic 0 has been done. So let us assume that  $f(x) \in F[x]$  is irreducible over a perfect field  $F$  of characteristic  $p$  and that  $f(x)$  has multiple zeros. From Theorem 19.6 we know that  $f(x) = g(x^p)$  for some  $g(x) \in F[x]$ , say,  $g(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \dots + a_1 x + a_0$ . Since  $F^p = F$ , each  $a_i$  in  $F$  can be written in the form  $b_i^p$  for some  $b_i$  in  $F$ . So, using Exercise 49a in Chapter 13, we have

$$
\begin{array}{l} f (x) = g \left(x ^ {p}\right) = b _ {n} ^ {p} x ^ {p n} + b _ {n - 1} ^ {p} x ^ {p (n - 1)} + \dots + b _ {1} ^ {p} x ^ {p} + b _ {0} ^ {p} \\ = (b _ {n} x ^ {n} + b _ {n - 1} x ^ {n - 1} + \dots + b _ {1} x + b _ {0}) ^ {p} = (h (x)) ^ {p}, \\ \end{array}
$$

where  $h(x) \in F[x]$ . But then  $f(x)$  is not irreducible.

The next theorem shows that when an irreducible polynomial does have multiple zeros, there is something striking about the multiplicities.

# Theorem 19.9 Zeros of an Irreducible over a Splitting Field

Let  $f(x)$  be an irreducible polynomial over a field  $F$  and let  $E$  be a splitting field of  $f(x)$  over  $F$ . Then all the zeros of  $f(x)$  in  $E$  have the same multiplicity.

PROOF Let  $a$  and  $b$  be distinct zeros of  $f(x)$  in  $E$ . If  $a$  has multiplicity  $m$ , then in  $E[x]$  we may write  $f(x) = (x - a)^{m}g(x)$ . It follows from the lemma preceding Theorem 19.4 and from Theorem 19.4 that there is a field isomorphism  $\phi$  from  $E$  to itself that carries  $a$  to  $b$  and acts as the identity on  $F$ . Thus,

$$
f (x) = \phi (f (x)) = (x - b) ^ {m} \phi (g (x)),
$$

and we see that the multiplicity of  $b$  is greater than or equal to the multiplicity of  $a$ . By interchanging the roles of  $a$  and  $b$ , we observe that the multiplicity of  $a$  is greater than or equal to the multiplicity of  $b$ . So, we have proved that  $a$  and  $b$  have the same multiplicity.

As an immediate corollary of Theorem 19.9 we have the following appealing result.

# Corollary Factorization of an Irreducible over a Splitting Field

Let  $f(x)$  be an irreducible polynomial over a field  $F$  and let  $E$  be a splitting field of  $f(x)$ . Then  $f(x)$  has the form

$$
a (x - a _ {1}) ^ {n} (x - a _ {2}) ^ {n} \dots (x - a _ {t}) ^ {n},
$$

where  $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_t$  are distinct elements of  $E$  and  $a \in F$ .

We conclude this chapter by giving an example of an irreducible polynomial over a field that does have a multiple zero. In particular, notice that the field we use is not perfect.

EXAMPLE 11 Let  $F = Z_{2}(t)$  be the field of quotients of the ring  $Z_{2}[t]$  of polynomials in the indeterminate  $t$  with coefficients from  $Z_{2}$ . (We must introduce a letter other than  $x$ , since the members of  $F$  are going to be our coefficients for the elements in  $F[x]$ .) Consider  $f(x) = x^{2} - t \in F[x]$ . To see that  $f(x)$  is irreducible over  $F$ , it suffices to show that it has no zeros in  $F$ . Well, suppose that  $h(t) / k(t)$  is a zero of  $f(x)$ . Then  $(h(t) / k(t))^{2} = t$ , and therefore  $(h(t))^{2} = t(k(t))^{2}$ . But  $\deg(h(t))^{2}$  is even, whereas  $\deg tk(t)^{2}$  is odd. So,  $f(x)$  is irreducible over  $F$ .

Finally, since  $t$  is a constant in  $F[x]$  and the characteristic of  $F$  is 2, we have  $f'(x) = 0$ , so that  $f'(x)$  and  $f(x)$  have  $f(x)$  as a common factor. So, by Theorem 19.5,  $f(x)$  has a multiple zero in some extension of  $F$ . (Indeed, it has a single zero of multiplicity 2 in  $K = F[x] / \langle x^2 - t \rangle$ .)

# Leopold Kronecker

He [Kronecker] wove together the three strands of his greatest interests—the theory of numbers, the theory of equations and elliptic functions—into one beautiful pattern.

LEOPOLD KRONECKER was born on December 7, 1823, in Liegnitz, Prussia. As a schoolboy, he received special instruction from the great algebraist Kummer. Kronecker entered the University of Berlin in 1841 and completed his Ph.D. dissertation in 1845 on the units in a certain ring.

Kronecker devoted the years 1845- 1853 to business affairs, relegating mathematics to a hobby. Thereafter, being well-off financially, he spent most of his time doing research in algebra and number theory. Kronecker was one of the early advocates of the abstract approach to algebra. He innovatively applied rings and fields in his investigations of algebraic numbers, established the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian

Groups, and was the first mathematician to master Galois's theory of fields.

Kronecker advocated constructive methods for all proofs and definitions. He believed that all mathematics should be based on relationships among integers. He went so far as to say to Lindemann who proved that  $\pi$  is transcendental, that irrational numbers do not exist. His most famous remark on the matter was "God made the integers, all the rest is the work of man." Henri Poincaré once remarked that Kronecker was able to produce fine work in number theory and algebra only by temporarily forgetting his own philosophy.

Kronecker died on December 29, 1891, at the age of 68.

# Algebraic Extensions

All things are difficult before they are easy.

Thomas Fuller

Banach once told me, "Good mathematicians see analogies between theorems or theories, the very best ones see analogies between analogies."

S. M. Ulam, Adventures of a Mathematician

# Characterization of Extensions

In Chapter 19, we saw that every element in the field  $Q(\sqrt{2})$  has the particularly simple form  $a + b\sqrt{2}$ , where  $a$  and  $b$  are rational. On the other hand, the elements of  $Q(\pi)$  have the more complicated form

$$
(a _ {n} \pi^ {n} + a _ {n - 1} \pi^ {n - 1} + \dots + a _ {0}) / (b _ {m} \pi^ {m} + b _ {m - 1} \pi^ {m - 1} + \dots + b _ {0}),
$$

where the  $a$ 's and  $b$ 's are rational. The fields of the first type have a great deal of algebraic structure. This structure is the subject of this chapter.

# Definitions Types of Extensions

Let  $E$  be an extension field of a field  $F$  and let  $a \in E$ . We call  $a$  algebraic over  $F$  if  $a$  is the zero of some nonzero polynomial in  $F[x]$ . If  $a$  is not algebraic over  $F$ , it is called transcendental over  $F$ . An extension  $E$  of  $F$  is called an algebraic extension of  $F$  if every element of  $E$  is algebraic over  $F$ . If  $E$  is not an algebraic extension of  $F$ , it is called a transcendental extension of  $F$ . An extension of  $F$  of the form  $F(a)$  is called a simple extension of  $F$ .

Leonhard Euler used the term transcendental for numbers that are not algebraic because "they transcended the power of algebraic methods." Although Euler made this distinction in 1744, it wasn't until 1844 that the existence of transcendental numbers over  $Q$  was proved by Joseph Liouville. Charles Hermite proved that  $e$  is transcendental over  $Q$  in 1873, and Lindemann showed that  $\pi$  is transcendental over  $Q$  in 1882. To this day, it is not known whether  $\pi + e$  is transcendental over  $Q$ . Other familiar examples of a transcendental numbers are the natural log of 2 and the sine of 1. With a precise definition of "almost all," it can be shown that almost all real numbers are transcendental over  $Q$ .

Theorem 20.1 shows why we make the distinction between elements that are algebraic over a field and elements that are transcendental over a field. Recall that  $F(x)$  is the field of quotients of  $F[x]$ ; that is,

$$
F (x) = \{f (x) / g (x) \mid f (x), g (x) \in F [ x ], g (x) \neq 0 \}.
$$

# Theorem 20.1 Characterization of Extensions

Let  $E$  be an extension field of the field  $F$  and let  $a \in E$ . If  $a$  is transcendental over  $F$ , then  $F(a) \approx F(x)$ . If  $a$  is algebraic over  $F$ , then  $F(a) \approx F[x] / \langle p(x) \rangle$ , where  $p(x)$  is a polynomial in  $F[x]$  of minimum degree such that  $p(a) = 0$ . Moreover,  $p(x)$  is irreducible over  $F$ .

PROOF Consider the homomorphism  $\phi \colon F[x] \to F(a)$  given by  $f(x) \to f(a)$ . If  $a$  is transcendental over  $F$ , then  $\operatorname{Ker} \phi = \{0\}$ , and so we may extend  $\phi$  to an isomorphism  $\bar{\phi} \colon F(x) \to F(a)$  by defining  $\bar{\phi}(f(x) / g(x)) = f(a) / g(a)$ .

If  $a$  is algebraic over  $F$ , then  $\operatorname{Ker} \phi \neq \{0\}$ ; and, by Theorem 16.5, there is a polynomial  $p(x)$  in  $F[x]$  such that  $\operatorname{Ker} \phi = \langle p(x) \rangle$  and  $p(x)$  has minimum degree among all nonzero elements of  $\operatorname{Ker} \phi$ . Thus,  $p(a) = 0$  and, since  $p(x)$  is a polynomial of minimum degree with this property, it is irreducible over  $F$ .

The proof of Theorem 20.1 can readily be adapted to yield the next two results also. The details are left to the reader (see Exercise 1).

# Theorem 20.2 Uniqueness Property

If  $a$  is algebraic over a field  $F$ , then there is a unique monic irreducible polynomial  $p(x)$  in  $F[x]$  such that  $p(a) = 0$ .

The polynomial with the property specified in Theorem 20.2 is called the minimal polynomial for a over  $F$ .

# Theorem 20.3 Divisibility Property

Let  $a$  be algebraic over  $F$ , and let  $p(x)$  be the minimal polynomial for  $a$  over  $F$ . If  $f(x) \in F[x]$  and  $f(a) = 0$ , then  $p(x)$  divides  $f(x)$  in  $F[x]$ .

If  $E$  is an extension field of  $F$ , we may view  $E$  as a vector space over  $F$  (i.e., the elements of  $E$  are the vectors and the elements of  $F$  are the scalars). We are then able to use such notions as dimension and basis in our discussion.<sup>1</sup>

# Finite Extensions

# Definitions Degree of an Extension

Let  $E$  be an extension field of a field  $F$ . We say that  $E$  has degree  $n$  over  $F$  and write  $[E:F] = n$  if  $E$  has dimension  $n$  as a vector space over  $F$ . If  $[E:F]$  is finite,  $E$  is called a finite extension of  $F$ ; otherwise, we say that  $E$  is an infinite extension of  $F$ .

Figure 20.1 illustrates a convenient method of depicting the degree of a field extension over a field.

EXAMPLE 1 The field of complex numbers has degree 2 over the reals, since  $\{1, i\}$  is a basis. The field of complex numbers is an infinite extension of the rationals.  
EXAMPLE 2 If  $a$  is algebraic over  $F$  and its minimal polynomial over  $F$  has degree  $n$ , then, by Theorem 19.3, we know that  $\{1, a, \ldots, a^{n-1}\}$  is a basis for  $F(a)$  over  $F$ ; and, therefore,  $[F(a):F] = n$ . In this case, we say that  $a$  has degree  $n$  over  $F$ .

# Theorem 20.4 Finite Implies Algebraic

If  $E$  is a finite extension of  $F$ , then  $E$  is an algebraic extension of  $F$ .

PROOF Suppose that  $[E:F] = n$  and  $a \in E$ . Then the set  $\{1, a, \ldots, a^n\}$  is linearly dependent over  $F$ ; that is, there are elements  $c_0, c_1, \ldots, c_n$  in  $F$ , not all zero, such that

$$
c _ {n} a ^ {n} + c _ {n - 1} a ^ {n - 1} + \dots + c _ {1} a + c _ {0} = 0.
$$

Clearly, then,  $a$  is a zero of the nonzero polynomial

$$
f (x) = c _ {n} x ^ {n} + c _ {n - 1} x ^ {n - 1} + \dots + c _ {1} x + c _ {0}.
$$

The converse of Theorem 20.4 is not true, for otherwise, the degrees of the elements of every algebraic extension of  $E$  over  $F$  would be bounded. But  $Q(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt[3]{2}, \sqrt[4]{2}, \ldots)$  is an algebraic extension of  $Q$  that contains elements of every degree over  $Q$  (see Exercise 3).

The next theorem is the field theory counterpart of Lagrange's Theorem for finite groups. Like all counting theorems, it has far-reaching consequences.

# Theorem 20.5  $[K:F] = [K:E][E:F]$  [Tower Rule]

Let  $K$  be a finite extension field of the field  $E$  and let  $E$  be a finite extension field of the field  $F$ . Then  $K$  is a finite extension field of  $F$  and  $[K:F] = [K:E][E:F]$ .

PROOF Let  $X = \{x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n}\}$  be a basis for  $K$  over  $E$ , and let  $Y = \{y_{1}, y_{2}, \ldots, y_{m}\}$  be a basis for  $E$  over  $F$ . It suffices to prove that

$$
Y X = \left\{y _ {j} x _ {i} \mid 1 \leq j \leq m, 1 \leq i \leq n \right\}
$$

is a basis for  $K$  over  $F$ . To do this, let  $a \in K$ . Then there are elements  $b_{1}, b_{2}, \ldots, b_{n} \in E$  such that

$$
a = b _ {1} x _ {1} + b _ {2} x _ {2} + \dots + b _ {n} x _ {n}
$$

and, for each  $i = 1,\dots ,n$  , there are elements  $c_{i1},c_{i2},\ldots ,c_{im}\in F$  such that

$$
b _ {i} = c _ {i 1} y _ {1} + c _ {i 2} y _ {2} + \dots + c _ {i m} y _ {m}.
$$

Thus,

$$
a = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} b _ {i} x _ {i} = \sum_ {i = 1} ^ {n} \left(\sum_ {j = 1} ^ {m} c _ {i j} y _ {j}\right) x _ {i} = \sum_ {i, j} c _ {i j} (y _ {j} x _ {i}).
$$

This proves that  $YX$  spans  $K$  over  $F$ .

Now suppose there are elements  $c_{ij}$  in  $F$  such that

$$
0 = \sum_ {i, j} c _ {i j} (y _ {j} x _ {i}) = \sum_ {i} \left(\sum_ {j} (c _ {i j} y _ {j})\right) x _ {i}.
$$

Then, since each  $\sum_{j}c_{ij}y_{j}\in E$  and  $X$  is a basis for  $K$  over  $E$ , we have

$$
\sum_ {j} c _ {i j} y _ {j} = 0
$$

for each  $i$ . But each  $c_{ij} \in F$  and  $Y$  is a basis for  $E$  over  $F$ , so each  $c_{ij} = 0$ . This proves that the set  $YX$  is linearly independent over  $F$ .

Theorem 20.5 easily extends to multiple field extensions. In words, the general case says that for a tower of finite field extensions  $F_{1} \subset F_{2} \subset \dots \subset F_{n}$  the degree of  $F_{n}$  over  $F_{1}$  is the product of the degrees of the terms  $[F_{i + 1}:F_i]$ .

Using the fact that for any field extension  $L$  of a field  $J$ ,  $[L:J] = n$  if and only if  $L$  is isomorphic to  $J^n$  as vector spaces (see Exercise 57), we may give a concise conceptual proof of Theorem 20.5, as follows. Let  $[K:E] = n$  and  $[E:F] = m$ . Then  $K \approx E^n$  and  $E \approx F^m$ , so that  $K \approx E^n \approx (F^m)^n \approx F^{mn}$ . Thus,  $[K:F] = mn$ .

The content of Theorem 20.5 can be pictured as in Figure 20.2. Examples 3, 4, and 5 show how Theorem 20.5 is often utilized.

EXAMPLE 3 Since  $\{1, \sqrt{3}\}$  is a basis for  $Q(\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5})$  over  $Q(\sqrt{5})$  and  $\{1, \sqrt{5}\}$  is a basis for  $Q(\sqrt{5})$  over  $Q$ , the proof of Theorem 20.5 shows that  $\{1, \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}, \sqrt{15}\}$  is a basis for  $Q(\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5})$  over  $Q$ . (See Figure 20.3.)

Figure 20.4 Extension of degree 12.

EXAMPLE 4 Consider  $Q(\sqrt[3]{2}, \sqrt[4]{3})$ . (See Figure 20.4) Then  $[Q(\sqrt[3]{2}, \sqrt[4]{3}):Q] = 12$ . For, clearly,

$$
[ Q (\sqrt [ 3 ]{2}, \sqrt [ 4 ]{3}): Q ] = [ Q (\sqrt [ 3 ]{2}, \sqrt [ 4 ]{3}): Q (\sqrt [ 3 ]{2}) ] [ Q (\sqrt [ 3 ]{2}): Q ]
$$

and

$$
[ Q (\sqrt [ 3 ]{2}, \sqrt [ 4 ]{3}): Q ] = [ Q (\sqrt [ 3 ]{2}, \sqrt [ 4 ]{3}): Q (\sqrt [ 4 ]{3}) ] [ Q (\sqrt [ 4 ]{3}): Q ]
$$

show that both  $3 = [Q(\sqrt[3]{2}):Q]$  and  $4 = [Q(\sqrt[4]{3}):Q]$  divide  $[Q(\sqrt[3]{2},\sqrt[4]{3}):Q]$ . Thus,  $[Q(\sqrt[3]{2},\sqrt[4]{3}):Q] \geq 12$ . On the other hand,  $[Q(\sqrt[3]{2},\sqrt[4]{3}):Q(\sqrt[3]{2})]$  is at most 4, since  $\sqrt[4]{3}$  is a zero of  $x^4 - 3 \in Q(\sqrt[3]{2})[x]$ . Therefore,

$$
[ Q (\sqrt [ 3 ]{2}, \sqrt [ 4 ]{3}): Q ] = [ Q (\sqrt [ 3 ]{2}, \sqrt [ 4 ]{3}): Q (\sqrt [ 3 ]{2}) ] [ Q (\sqrt [ 3 ]{2}): Q ] \leq 4 \cdot 3 = 1 2.
$$

(See Figure 20.4.)

Theorem 20.5 can sometimes be used to show that a field does not contain a particular element.

EXAMPLE 5 Recall from Example 7 in Chapter 17 that  $h(x) = 15x^4 - 10x^2 + 9x + 21$  is irreducible over  $Q$ . Let  $\beta$  be a zero of  $h(x)$  in some extension of  $Q$ . Then, even though we don't know what  $\beta$  is, we can still prove that  $\sqrt[3]{2}$  is not an element of  $Q(\beta)$ . For, if so, then  $Q \subset Q(\sqrt[3]{2}) \subseteq Q(\beta)$  and  $4 = [Q(\beta):Q] = [Q(\beta):Q(\sqrt[3]{2})][Q(\sqrt[3]{2}):Q]$  implies that 3 divides 4. Notice that this argument cannot be used to show that  $\sqrt{2}$  is not contained in  $Q(\beta)$ .

EXAMPLE 6 Consider  $Q(\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5})$ . We claim that  $Q(\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5}) = Q(\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{5})$ . The inclusion  $Q(\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{5}) \subseteq Q(\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5})$  is clear. Now note that since

$$
(\sqrt {3} + \sqrt {5}) ^ {- 1} = \frac {1}{\sqrt {3} + \sqrt {5}} \cdot \frac {\sqrt {3} - \sqrt {5}}{\sqrt {3} - \sqrt {5}} = - \frac {1}{2} (\sqrt {3} - \sqrt {5}),
$$

we know that  $\sqrt{3} -\sqrt{5}$  belongs to  $Q(\sqrt{3} +\sqrt{5})$  . It follows that  $((\sqrt{3} +\sqrt{5})+$ $(\sqrt{3} -\sqrt{5})) / 2 = \sqrt{3}$  and  $((\sqrt{3} -\sqrt{5}) + (\sqrt{3} -\sqrt{5})) / 2 = \sqrt{5}$  both belong to  $Q(\sqrt{3} +\sqrt{5})$  , and therefore  $Q(\sqrt{3},\sqrt{5})\subseteq Q(\sqrt{3} +\sqrt{5})$

EXAMPLE 7 It follows from Example 6 and Theorem 19.3 that the minimal polynomial for  $\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{5}$  over  $Q$  has degree 4. How can we find this polynomial? We begin with  $x = \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{5}$ . Then  $x^2 = 3 + 2\sqrt{15} + 5$ . From this we obtain  $x^2 - 8 = 2\sqrt{15}$  and, by squaring both sides,  $x^4 - 16x^2 + 64 = 60$ . Thus,  $\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{5}$  is a zero of  $x^4 - 16x + 4$ . We know that this is the minimal polynomial of  $\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{5}$  over  $Q$  since it is monic and has degree 4.

Example 6 shows that an extension obtained by adjoining two elements to a field can sometimes be obtained by adjoining a single element to the field. Our next theorem shows that, under certain conditions, this can always be done.

Theorem 20.6 Primitive Element Theorem (Steinitz, 1910)

If  $F$  is a field of characteristic 0, and  $a$  and  $b$  are algebraic over  $F$ , then there is an element  $c$  in  $F(a, b)$  such that  $F(a, b) = F(c)$ .

PROOF Let  $p(x)$  and  $q(x)$  be the minimal polynomials over  $F$  for  $a$  and  $b$ , respectively. In some extension  $K$  of  $F$ , let  $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_m$  and  $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$  be the distinct zeros of  $p(x)$  and  $q(x)$ , respectively, where  $a = a_1$  and  $b = b_1$ . Among the infinitely many elements of  $F$ , choose an element  $d$  not equal to  $(a_i - a) / (b - b_j)$  for all  $i \geq 1$  and all  $j > 1$ . In particular,  $a_i \neq a + d(b - b_j)$  for  $j > 1$ .

We shall show that  $c = a + db$  has the property that  $F(a, b) = F(c)$ . Certainly,  $F(c) \subseteq F(a, b)$ . To verify that  $F(a, b) \subseteq F(c)$ , it suffices to prove that  $b \in F(c)$ , for then  $b, c$ , and  $d$  belong to  $F(c)$  and  $a = c - bd$ . Consider the polynomials  $q(x)$  and  $r(x) = p(c - dx)$  [i.e.,  $r(x)$  is obtained by substituting  $c - dx$  for  $x$  in  $p(x)$ ] over  $F(c)$ . Since both  $q(b) = 0$  and  $r(b) = p(c - db) = p(a) = 0$ , both  $q(x)$  and  $r(x)$  are divisible by the minimal polynomial  $s(x)$ .

for  $b$  over  $F(c)$  (see Theorem 20.3). Because  $s(x) \in F(c)[x]$ , we may complete the proof by proving that  $s(x) = x - b$ . Since  $s(x)$  is a common divisor of  $q(x)$  and  $r(x)$ , the only possible zeros of  $s(x)$  in  $K$  are the zeros of  $q(x)$  that are also zeros of  $r(x)$ . But  $r(b_{j}) = p(c - db_{j}) = p(a + db - db_{j}) = p(a + d(b - b_{j}))$  and  $d$  was chosen such that  $a + d(b - b_{j}) \neq a_{i}$  for  $j > 1$ . It follows that  $b$  is the only zero of  $s(x)$  in  $K[x]$  and, therefore,  $s(x) = (x - b)^{u}$ . Since  $s(x)$  is irreducible and  $F$  has characteristic 0, Theorem 19.6 guarantees that  $u = 1$ .

In the terminology introduced earlier, it follows from Theorem 20.6 and induction that any finite extension of a field of characteristic 0 is a simple extension. An element  $a$  with the property that  $E = F(a)$  is called a primitive element of  $E$ .

# Properties of Algebraic Extensions

# Theorem 20.7 Algebraic over Algebraic Is Algebraic

If  $K$  is an algebraic extension of  $E$  and  $E$  is an algebraic extension of  $F$ , then  $K$  is an algebraic extension of  $F$ .

PROOF Let  $a \in K$ . It suffices to show that  $a$  belongs to some finite extension of  $F$ . Since  $a$  is algebraic over  $E$ , we know that  $a$  is the zero of some irreducible polynomial in  $E[x]$ , say,  $p(x) = b_n x^n + \dots + b_0$ . Now we construct a tower of extension fields of  $F$ , as follows:

$$
F _ {0} = F \left(b _ {0}\right),
$$

$$
F _ {1} = F _ {0} \left(b _ {1}\right), \dots , F _ {n} = F _ {n - 1} \left(b _ {n}\right).
$$

In particular,

$$
F _ {n} = F (b _ {0}, b _ {1}, \dots , b _ {n}),
$$

so that  $p(x) \in F_n[x]$ . Thus,  $[F_n(a):F_n] = n$ ; and, because each  $b_i$  is algebraic over  $F$ , we know that each  $[F_{i + 1}:F_i]$  is finite. So,

$$
[ F _ {n} (a): F ] = [ F _ {n} (a): F _ {n} ] [ F _ {n}: F _ {n - 1} ] \dots [ F _ {1}: F _ {0} ] [ F _ {0}: F ]
$$

is finite. (See Figure 20.5.)

# Corollary Subfield of Algebraic Elements

Let  $E$  be an extension field of the field  $F$ . Then the set of all elements of  $E$  that are algebraic over  $F$  is a subfield of  $E$ .

PROOF Suppose that  $a, b \in E$  are algebraic over  $F$  and  $b \neq 0$ . To show that  $a + b, a - b, ab$ , and  $a / b$  are algebraic over  $F$ , it suffices to show that

Figure 20.5 Tower of extensions fields.

$[F(a,b):F]$  is finite, since each of these four elements belongs to  $F(a,b)$ . But note that

$$
[ F (a, b): F ] = [ F (a, b): F (b) ] [ F (b): F ].
$$

Also, since  $a$  is algebraic over  $F$ , it is certainly algebraic over  $F(b)$ . Thus, both  $[F(a,b):F(b)]$  and  $[F(b):F]$  are finite.

One might wonder if there is such a thing as a maximal algebraic extension of a field  $F$  — that is, whether there is an algebraic extension  $E$  of  $F$  that has no proper algebraic extensions. For such an  $E$  to exist, it is necessary that every polynomial in  $E[x]$  splits in  $E$ . Otherwise, it follows from Kronecker's Theorem that  $E$  would have a proper algebraic extension. This condition is also sufficient. If every member of  $E[x]$  splits in  $E$ , and  $K$  is an algebraic extension of  $E$ , then every member of  $K$  is a zero of some element of  $E[x]$ . But the zeros of elements of  $E[x]$  are in  $E$ . A field that has no proper algebraic extension is called algebraically closed. In 1910, Ernst Steinitz proved that every field  $F$  has a unique (up to isomorphism) algebraic extension that is algebraically closed. This field is called the algebraic closure of  $F$ . A proof of this result requires a sophisticated set theory background. The algebraic closure of  $Q$  consists of those complex numbers that are zeros of some nonzero polynomial in one variable with rational coefficients. An example is  $(\sqrt[4]{\sqrt{(3/2)} - \sqrt[3]{-5}})/2$ .

In 1799, Gauss, at the age of 22, proved that  $\mathbf{C}$  is algebraically closed. This fact was considered so important at the time that it was called the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. Over a 50-year period, Gauss found three additional proofs of the Fundamental Theorem. Today more than 100 proofs exist. In view of the ascendancy of abstract algebra in the 20th century, a more appropriate phrase for Gauss's result would be the Fundamental Theorem of Classical Algebra.

ERNST STEINITZ was born in Laurahtte, Silesia, Germany (now Poland) on June 13, 1871. He received a Ph.D. at the University of Breslau in 1894. Steinitz's seminal work was a 1910 paper in which he was the first to give an abstract definition of the concept of a "field." Among the concepts he introduced there are: prime field, perfect fields, degree of an extension, and algebraic closure. In his classic textbook on Modern Algebra van der Waerden wrote: "Almost all the notions and facts about fields which we teach our students in such a course, are contained in Steinitz's paper." Hulmut Hasse wrote in his textbook on Higher Algebra:

"Every algebraist should have read at least once this basic original paper on field theory." In his book on the history of mathematics, Bourbaki describes Steinitz's paper on fields as "a fundamental work which may be considered as the origin of today's concept of algebra." In addition to field theory Steinitz made important contributions to theory of polyhedra, module theory, linear algebra, algebraic geometry and graph theory. Two of his famous theorems are the Steinitz replacement theorem for vector spaces and the Primitive Element Theorem. He died on September 29, 1928 in Kiel, Germany.

# Finite Fields

Even though these numerical systems [finite fields] look very different from the numerical systems we are used to, such as the rational numbers, they have the same salient properties.

Edward Frenkel, Love and Math

This theory [of finite fields] is of considerable interest in its own right and it provides a particularly beautiful example of how the general theory of the preceding chapters fits together to provide a rather detailed description of all finite fields.

# Classification of Finite Fields

In this, our final chapter on field theory, we take up one of the most beautiful and important areas of abstract algebra—finite fields. Finite fields were first introduced by Galois in 1830 in his proof of the unsolvability of the general quintic equation. When Cayley invented matrices a few decades later, it was natural to investigate groups of matrices over finite fields. To this day, matrix groups over finite fields are among the most important classes of groups. In the past 70 years, there have been important applications of finite fields in computer science, coding theory, information theory, and cryptography. Recently finite fields of orders 4 and 16 have been used in analyzing strings of DNA. But, besides the many uses of finite fields in pure and applied mathematics, there is yet another good reason for studying them. They are just plain fun!

The most striking fact about finite fields is the restricted nature of their order and structure. Moreover, their additive and multiplicative structures are extremely simple. The proofs of our results will utilize properties of finite Abelian groups, integral domains, vector spaces, and finite extensions of fields.

Our first theorem characterizes the orders of finite fields.

# Theorem 21.1 Classification of Finite Fields

Every finite field has prime-power order. Moreover, for each prime  $p$  and each positive integer  $n$ , there is, up to isomorphism, a unique finite field of order  $p^n$ .

PROOF Let  $F$  be a finite field. By Theorem 13.4, the characteristic of  $F$  is a prime  $p$ . So,  $px = 0$  for every  $x$  in  $F$ . If there were a prime  $q \neq p$  that is a divisor of  $|F|$ , then by Cauchy's theorem for Abelian groups (Theorem 9.5),  $F$  would have an element of order  $q$ , which is a contradiction. Thus,  $|F| = p^n$  for some positive integer  $n$  where  $\operatorname{char} F = p$ .

For the existence portion, consider the splitting field  $E$  of  $f(x) = x^{p^n} - x$  over  $Z_p$ . We will show that  $|E| = p^n$ . Since  $f(x)$  splits in  $E$ , we know that  $f(x)$  has exactly  $p^n$  zeros in  $E$ , counting multiplicity. Moreover, by Theorem 19.5, every zero of  $f(x)$  has multiplicity 1. Thus,  $f(x)$  has  $p^n$  distinct zeros in  $E$ . On the other hand, the set of zeros of  $f(x)$  in  $E$  is closed under addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division by nonzero elements (see Exercise 39), so that the set of zeros of  $f(x)$  is itself an extension field of  $Z_p$  in which  $f(x)$  splits. Thus, the set of zeros of  $f(x)$  is  $E$  and, therefore,  $|E| = p^n$ .

To show that there is a unique field for each prime-power, suppose that  $K$  is any field of order  $p^n$ . Then  $K$  has a subfield isomorphic to  $Z_p$  (generated by 1), and, because the nonzero elements of  $K$  form a multiplicative group of order  $p^n - 1$ , every element of  $K$  is a zero of  $f(x) = x^{p^n} - x$  (see Exercise 39). So,  $K$  must be a splitting field for  $f(x)$  over  $Z_p$ . By the corollary to Theorem 19.4, there is only one such field up to isomorphism.

The existence portion of Theorem 21.1 appeared in the works of Galois and Gauss in the first third of the 19th century. Rigorous proofs were given by Dedekind in 1857 and by Jordan in 1870 in his classic book on group theory. The uniqueness portion of the theorem was proved by E. H. Moore in an 1893 paper concerning finite groups. The mathematics historian E. T. Bell once said that this paper by Moore marked the beginning of abstract algebra in America.

Because there is only one field for each prime-power  $p^n$ , we may unambiguously denote it by  $\mathrm{GF}(p^n)$ , in honor of Galois, and call it the Galois field of order  $p^n$ . When discussing fields we sometimes use  $\mathrm{GF}(p)$  interchangeably with  $Z_p$ .

# Structure of Finite Fields

The next theorem is immensely satisfying. It tells us the additive and multiplicative group structure of a finite field of order  $p^n$ .

The proof utilized results from Chapters 4, 8, 11,13, and 16.

# Theorem 21.2 Structure of Finite Fields

As a group under addition,  $GF(p^n)$  is isomorphic to

$$
\underbrace {Z _ {p} \oplus Z _ {p} \oplus \ldots \oplus Z _ {p}} _ {n f a c t o r s}.
$$

As a group under multiplication, the set of nonzero elements of  $GF(p^n)$  is isomorphic to  $Z_{p^{n-1}}$  (and is, therefore, cyclic).

PROOF Since  $\mathrm{GF}(p^n)$  has characteristic  $p$  (Theorem 13.3), every nonzero element of  $\mathrm{GF}(p^n)$  has additive order  $p$ . Then by the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups,  $\mathrm{GF}(p^n)$  under addition is isomorphic to a direct product of  $n$  copies of  $Z_p$ .

To see that the multiplicative group  $\mathrm{GF}(p^n)^*$  of nonzero elements of  $\mathrm{GF}(p^n)$  is cyclic, we first note that by the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups (Theorem 11.1),  $\mathrm{GF}(p^n)^*$  is isomorphic to a direct product of the form  $Z_{n_1} \oplus Z_{n_2} \oplus \dots \oplus Z_{n_m}$ . If the orders of these components are pairwise relatively prime, then it follows from Corollary 1 of Theorem 8.2 that  $\mathrm{GF}(p^n)^*$  is cyclic. Hence we may assume that there is an integer  $d > 1$  that divides the orders of two of the components. From the Fundamental Theorem of Cyclic Groups (Theorem 4.3) we know that each of these components has a subgroup of order  $d$ . This means that  $\mathrm{GF}(p^n)^*$  has two distinct subgroups of order  $d$ , call them  $H$  and  $K$ . But then every element of  $H$  and  $K$  is a zero of  $x^d - 1$ , which contradicts the fact that a polynomial of degree  $d$  over a field can have at most  $d$  zeros (Theorem 16.3).

It is worth noting the extreme contrast between the additive structure of  $\mathrm{GF}(p^n)$  and its multiplicative structure when viewed as a direct product of cyclic groups. Under addition,  $\mathrm{GF}(p^n)$  has the maximum number of possible of terms  $(n)$ ; under multiplication  $GF(p^{n})^{*}$  has the minimum number (one).

Some students misinterpret Theorem 21.2 to mean that  $Z_{p} \oplus Z_{p} \oplus \dots \oplus Z_{p}$  is a field of order  $p^n$ . Since any element of  $Z_{p} \oplus Z_{p} \oplus \dots \oplus Z_{p}$  that has at least one coordinate equal to 0 cannot have an inverse, it is not a field.

From the fact that  $Z_{p} \oplus Z_{p} \oplus \dots \oplus Z_{p}$  is a vector space over  $Z_{p}$  with  $\{(1,0,\ldots,0), (0,1,0,\ldots,0), \ldots, (0,0,\ldots,1)\}$  as a basis, we have the following useful and aesthetically appealing formula.

# Corollary 1 Degree of  $\mathbf{GF}(p^n)$

$$
[ \mathrm {G F} (p ^ {n}): \mathrm {G F} (p) ] = n
$$

# Corollary 2  $\mathrm{GF}(p^n)$  Contains an Element of Degree  $n$

Let  $a$  be a generator of the group of nonzero elements of  $GF(p^n)$  under multiplication. Then  $a$  is algebraic over  $GF(p)$  of degree  $n$ .

PROOF Observe that  $[\mathrm{GF}(p)(a):\mathrm{GF}(p)] = [\mathrm{GF}(p^n):\mathrm{GF}(p)] = n.$

Although Theorems 21.1 and 21.2 tell us that fields of order  $p^n$  exist for all primes  $p$  and positive integers  $n$ , to construct them we revert to Theorem 19.3.

EXAMPLE 1 Let's examine the field  $\mathrm{GF}(16)$  in detail. Since  $x^4 + x + 1$  is irreducible over  $Z_2$ , we know by Theorems 21.1 and 19.3 that for any zero  $a$  of  $x^4 + x + 1$  in  $\mathrm{GF}(16)$  we have

$$
\operatorname {G F} (1 6) \approx \left\{c _ {3} a ^ {3} + c _ {2} a ^ {2} + c _ {1} a + c _ {0} \mid c _ {0}, c _ {1}, c _ {2}, c _ {3}, c _ {4} \in Z _ {2} \right\}
$$

where addition is done as in  $Z_{2}(a)$ . To determine which of the 16 elements in the field is, say, the product  $(a^{3} + a^{2} + a + 1)(a^{3} + a)$  we expand it in the usual way and note that the condition  $a^4 + a + 1 = 0$  implies that

$$
a ^ {4} = a + 1,
$$

$$
a ^ {5} = a ^ {2} + a,
$$

$$
a ^ {6} = a ^ {3} + a ^ {2}.
$$

Thus,

$$
\begin{array}{l} (a ^ {3} + a ^ {2} + a + 1) (a ^ {3} + a) = a ^ {6} + a ^ {5} + a ^ {4} + a ^ {3} + a ^ {4} + a ^ {3} + a ^ {2} + a \\ = a ^ {6} + a ^ {5} + a ^ {2} + a = \left(a ^ {3} + a ^ {2}\right) + \left(a ^ {2} + a\right) + a ^ {2} + a = a ^ {3} + a ^ {2}. \\ \end{array}
$$

A way to simplify the multiplication process is to make use of the fact that the nonzero elements of  $\mathrm{GF}(16)$  form a cyclic group of order 15. To take advantage of this, we must first find a generator of this group. Since any element  $\mathrm{GF}(16)^*$  must have a multiplicative order that divides 15, all we need to do is find an element in  $\mathrm{GF}(16)^*$  whose order is not 1, 3, or 5. Our calculations have shown that  $a$  has these properties. So, we may think of  $\mathrm{GF}(16)$  as the set  $\{0,1,a,a^2,\ldots,a^{14}\}$ , where  $a^{15} = 1$ . This makes multiplication in  $\mathrm{GF}(16)$  trivial, but, unfortunately, it makes addition more difficult. For example,  $a^{10} \cdot a^7 = a^{17} = a^2$ , but what is  $(a^{10} + a^7)^{-1}$ ? So, we face a dilemma. If we write the elements of  $\mathrm{GF}(16)$  in the additive form  $c_3a^3 + c_2a^2 + c_3a + c_4$ , then addition is easy and multiplication is hard. On the other hand, if we write the elements of  $\mathrm{GF}(16)^*$  in the multiplicative form  $a^i$ , then multiplication is easy and addition is hard. Can we have the best of both? Yes, we can. All we need to do is use the relation  $a^4 = a + 1$  to make a two-way conversion table, as in Table 21.1. So, we see from Table 21.1 that

$$
a ^ {1 0} + a ^ {7} = (a ^ {2} + a + 1) + (a ^ {3} + a + 1) = a ^ {3} + a ^ {2} = a ^ {6}
$$

and

$$
(a ^ {3} + a ^ {2} + 1) (a ^ {3} + a ^ {2} + a + 1) = a ^ {1 3} \cdot a ^ {1 2} = a ^ {2 5} = a ^ {1 0} = a ^ {2} + a + 1.
$$

Don't be misled by the preceding example into believing that a zero of the irreducible polynomial used to construct a finite field is always a generator for the cyclic multiplicative group of nonzero elements. It is not. For example, the zero of  $x^{2} + 1 \in Z_{3}[x]$ , has order 4 in the multiplicative group of  $Z_{3}[x] / \langle x^{2} + 1 \rangle$ , which has order 8. (See also Exercise 33.) Although any two irreducible polynomials of the same degree over  $Z_{p}[x]$  yield isomorphic fields, some are better than others for computational purposes.

EXAMPLE 2 Consider  $f(x) = x^{3} + x^{2} + 1$  over  $Z_{2}$ . We will show how to write  $f(x)$  as the product of linear factors. Let  $F = Z_{2}[x] / \langle f(x) \rangle$  and let  $a$  be a zero of  $f(x)$  in  $F$ . Then  $|F| = 8$  and  $|F^{*}| = 7$ . So, by Corollary 2 to Theorem 7.1, we know that  $|a| = 7$ . Thus, by Theorem 19.3,

$$
\begin{array}{l} F = \{0, 1, a, a ^ {2}, a ^ {3}, a ^ {4}, a ^ {5}, a ^ {6} \} \\ = \{0, 1, a, a + 1, a ^ {2}, a ^ {2} + a + 1, a ^ {2} + 1, a ^ {2} + a \}. \\ \end{array}
$$

We know that  $a$  is one zero of  $f(x)$ , and we can test the other elements of  $F$  to see if they are zeros. We can simplify the calculations by using the fact that  $a^3 + a^2 + 1 = 0$  to make a conversion table for the two forms of writing

the elements of  $F$ . Because  $\operatorname{char} F = 2$ , we know that  $a^3 = a^2 + 1$ . Then,

$$
\begin{array}{l} a ^ {4} = a ^ {3} + a = (a ^ {2} + 1) + a = a ^ {2} + a + 1, \\ a ^ {5} = a ^ {3} + a ^ {2} + a = (a ^ {2} + 1) + a ^ {2} + a = a + 1, \\ a ^ {6} = a ^ {2} + a, \\ a ^ {7} = 1. \\ \end{array}
$$

Now let's see whether  $a^2$  is a zero of  $f(x)$ .

$$
\begin{array}{l} f (a ^ {2}) = \left(a ^ {2}\right) ^ {3} + \left(a ^ {2}\right) ^ {2} + 1 = a ^ {6} + a ^ {4} + 1 \\ = (a ^ {2} + a) + (a ^ {2} + a + 1) + 1 = 0. \\ \end{array}
$$

So, yes, it is. Next we try  $a^3$ .

$$
\begin{array}{l} f \left(a ^ {3}\right) = \left(a ^ {3}\right) ^ {3} + \left(a ^ {3}\right) ^ {2} + 1 = a ^ {9} + a ^ {6} + 1 \\ = a ^ {2} + (a ^ {2} + a) + 1 = a + 1 \neq 0. \\ \end{array}
$$

Now  $a^4$

$$
\begin{array}{l} f (a ^ {4}) = (a ^ {4}) ^ {3} + (a ^ {4}) ^ {2} + 1 = a ^ {1 2} + a ^ {8} + 1 \\ = a ^ {5} + a + 1 = (a + 1) + a + 1 = 0. \\ \end{array}
$$

So,  $a^4$  is our remaining zero. Thus,  $f(x) = (x - a)(x - a^2)(x - a^4) = (x + a)(x + a^2)(x + a^4)$ , since char  $F = 2$ .

Instead of testing for zeros one by one as we did in Example 2, our next theorem provides a remarkably simple method for finding all of the zeros of an irreducible polynomial over  $Z_{p}$  given a single zero.

# Theorem 21.3 Zeros of an Irreducible over  $Z_{p}$

Let  $f(x) \in Z_p[x]$  be an irreducible polynomial over  $Z_p$  of degree  $d$  and let  $a$  be a zero of  $f(x)$  in some extension field  $E$  of  $Z_p$ . Then  $a, a^p, a^{p^2}, \ldots, a^{p^{d-1}}$  are the zeros of  $f(x)$  and they are distinct.

PROOF The case that  $a \in Z_p$  means that  $d = 1$  and  $a$  is the only zero of  $p(x)$ . So we assume that  $d \neq 1$ . Observe that because  $|Z_p^*| = p - 1$  for any element  $c \in Z_p^*$  we have  $c^{p - 1} = 1$ . Thus for all  $c \in Z_p$  we have  $c^p = c$ . From this it follows that  $c^{p^i} = c$  for all  $c \in Z_p$  and all positive integers  $i$  (see Exercise 49 in Chapter 13). Let  $f(x) = c_d x^d + c_{d - 1} x^{d - 1} + \dots + c_1 x + c_0 \in Z_p[x]$ . Then  $f(a) = c_d a^d + c_{d - 1} a^{d - 1} + \dots + c_1 a + c_0 = 0$ . Applying the automorphism of  $\mathrm{GF}(p^n)$  given by  $\phi(x) = x^{p^i}$  we have  $c_d^{p^i} (a^{p^i})^d + c_{n - 1}^{p^i} (a^{p^i})^{d - 1} + \dots + c_1^{p^i} a^{p^i} + c_0^{p^i} = c_d (a^{p^i})^d + c_{n - 1} (a^{p^i})^{d - 1} + \dots + c_1 a^{p^i} + c_0 = 0$ .

To see that the zeros  $a, a^p, a^{p^2}, \ldots, a^{p^{d-1}}$  are distinct suppose that  $a^{p^m} = a^{p^n}$  for some  $0 \leq n < m < d$  and let  $m - n = j$ . Then  $0 = a^{p^m} - a^{p^n} =$

$a^{p^{n + j}} - a^{p^n} = (a^{p^n})^{p^j} - a^{p^n} = (a^{p^j})^{p^n} - a^{p^n} = (a^{p^j} - a)^{p^n}$ . Thus we have  $a^{p^j} - a = 0$ . Let  $K = \{x \in Z_p(a) \mid x^{p^j} - x = 0\}$ . Then  $K$  is a subfield of  $Z_p(a)$  order at most  $p^j$  (here we use that  $(Z_p(a))^*$  is cyclic) that contains both  $Z_p$  and  $a$ . Noting that  $|Z_p(a)| = p^d$  we now have that  $p^j \geq |K| \geq p^d$ , which is impossible.

As an immediate corollary of Theorem 21.3 we cannot resist recording the following useful result.

# ■ Corollary Splitting Field of an Irreducible Polynomial Over  $Z_{p}$

If  $f(x)$  is an irreducible polynomial over  $Z_{p}$  and  $a$  is a zero of  $f(x)$  in some extension field of  $Z_{p}$ , then  $Z_{p}(a)$  is the splitting field of  $f(x)$  over  $Z_{p}$ .

EXAMPLE 3 Let  $a$  be a zero of  $f(x) = x^3 + 2x + 1$  in  $\mathrm{GF}(27)$ . From Theorem 21.3 we know that the three zeros of  $f(x)$  in  $\mathrm{GF}(27)$  are  $a, a^3$  and  $a^3 = a^9$ . So,  $f(x)$  factors over  $Z_3$  as  $(x - a)(x - a^3)(x - a^9)$ .

The contrast in the ease in factoring the polynomial in Example 2 versus the one in Example 3 beautifully illustrates the power of Theorem 21.3.

# Subfields of a Finite Field

Theorem 21.1 gives us a complete description of all finite fields. The following theorem gives us a complete description of all the subfields of a finite field. Notice the close parallel between this theorem and Theorem 4.3, which describes all the subgroups of a finite cyclic group.

# Theorem 21.4 Subfields of a Finite Field

For each divisor  $d$  of  $n$ ,  $\operatorname{GF}(p^n)$  has a unique subfield of order  $p^d$ . Moreover, these are the only subfields of  $\operatorname{GF}(p^n)$ .

PROOF To show the existence portion of the theorem, suppose that  $d$  divides  $n$ . Then, since

$$
p ^ {n} - 1 = (p ^ {d} - 1) (p ^ {n - d} + p ^ {n - 2 d} + \dots + p ^ {d} + 1),
$$

we see that  $p^d - 1$  divides  $p^n - 1$ . For simplicity, write  $p^n - 1 = (p^d - 1)t$ . Let  $K = \{x \in \mathrm{GF}(p^n) \mid x^{p^d} = x\}$ . We leave it as an easy exercise for the reader to show that  $K$  is a subfield of  $\mathrm{GF}(p^n)$  (Exercise 37). Since the polynomial  $x^{p^d} - x$  has at most  $p^d$  zeros in  $\mathrm{GF}(p^n)$ , we have  $|K| \leq p^d$ . Let  $\langle a \rangle = \mathrm{GF}(p^n)^*$ . Then  $|a^t| = p^d - 1$ , and since  $(a^t)^{p^{d-1}} = 1$ , multiplying both sides by  $a$  we see that  $a^t \in K$ . So,  $K$  is a subfield of  $\mathrm{GF}(p^n)$  of order  $p^d$ .

The uniqueness portion of the theorem follows from the observation that because  $\mathrm{GF}(p^n)^*$  is cyclic, it has a unique subgroup for each divisor of its order.

Finally, suppose that  $F$  is a subfield of  $GF(p^n)$ . Then  $F$  is isomorphic to  $GF(p^d)$  for some  $d$  and, by Theorem 20.5,

$$
\begin{array}{l} n = [ \mathrm {G F} (p ^ {n}): \mathrm {G F} (p) ] \\ = [ \mathrm {G F} (p ^ {n}): \mathrm {G F} (p ^ {d}) ] [ \mathrm {G F} (p ^ {d}): \mathrm {G F} (p) ] \\ = \left[ \operatorname {G F} \left(p ^ {n}\right): \operatorname {G F} \left(p ^ {d}\right) \right] d. \\ \end{array}
$$

Thus,  $d$  divides  $n$ .

As illustrated in the next three examples, Theorems 21.2 and 21.4, together with Theorem 4.3, make the task of finding the subfields of a finite field a simple exercise in arithmetic.

EXAMPLE 4 The subfield lattice of  $\mathrm{GF}(2^{24})$  is the following.

![](images/bd1726a11f37ba335ead052f5920e6f7ea529c067fd6bea7179e2434bb8dc537.jpg)

EXAMPLE 5 Let  $F$  be the field of order 16 given in Example 1. Then there are exactly three subfields of  $F$ , and their orders are 2, 4, and 16. Obviously, the subfield of order 2 is  $\{0, 1\}$  and the subfield of order 16 is  $F$  itself. To find the subfield of order 4, we merely observe that the three nonzero elements of this subfield must be the cyclic subgroup of  $F^* = \langle a \rangle$  of order 3. So the subfield of order 4 is

$$
\{0, 1, a ^ {5}, a ^ {1 0} \} = \{0, 1, a ^ {2} + a, a ^ {2} + a + 1 \}.
$$

EXAMPLE 6 If  $F$  is a field of order  $3^6 = 729$  and  $a$  is a generator of  $F^*$ , then the subfields of  $F$  are

1.  $\mathrm{GF}(3) = \{0\} \cup \langle a^{364}\rangle = \{0,1,2\}$  
2.  $\operatorname {GF}(9) = \{0\} \cup \langle a^{91}\rangle$

3.  $\mathrm{GF}(27) = \{0\} \cup \langle a^{28}\rangle$  
4.  $\operatorname{GF}(729) = \{0\} \cup \langle a\rangle$

As an attractive application of Theorem 21.4 we can now describe the algebraic closure of  $\mathrm{GF}(p)$ . It is denoted by  $\mathrm{GF}(p^{\infty})$  and is defined as the union of the infinite tower of fields given by  $\mathrm{GF}(p^{1!})\subset \mathrm{GF}(p^{2!})\subset \mathrm{GF}(p^{3!})\subset \dots$ . We leave the proof that  $\mathrm{GF}(p^{\infty})$  is a field that has no algebraic extensions as an exercise (Exercise 69).

Theorem 21.4 provides us with the following a useful fact for determining information about the factorization of  $x^{p^n} - x$  as a product of irreducible polynomials over  $Z_p$ .

Theorem 21.5 Degrees of Irreducible Factors of  $x^{p^n} - x$  over  $Z_p$

The degree of an irreducible factor of  $x^{p^n} - x$  over  $Z_p$  divides  $n$ .

PROOF If  $g(x)$  is an irreducible factor of  $x^{p^n} - x$  over  $Z_p$  with degree  $d$  and  $a \in \mathrm{GF}(p^n)$  is a zero of  $g(x)$ , then  $|Z_p(a)| = p^d$ . So,  $d$  is a divisor of  $n$ .

EXAMPLE 7 Let's look at the irreducible factorization of  $x^{16} - x$  used to construct  $\mathrm{GF}(16)$ . Obviously,  $x$  and  $x - 1$  are factors. By the corollary of Theorem 21.3 the other irreducible factors of  $x^{16} - x$  have degrees 2 or 4. Fortunately, it is possible to determine these factors without resorting to long division. Since  $x^{16} - x$  has no multiple zeros in  $\mathrm{GF}(16)$ , it has no irreducible factors with multiplicity greater than 1. Because the sum of the degrees of the nonlinear irreducible factors of  $x^{16} - x$  must be 14, and 14 is not a multiple of 4, not all the irreducible factors can be quartics. Noting that the only irreducible quadratic over  $Z_{2}$  is  $x^{2} + x + 1$ , we know the irreducible factorization consists of it and three quartics. Finally, we observe that any quartic irreducible factor must begin with  $x^{4}$ , end with 1, and have an odd number of terms in between (otherwise, 1 would be a zero). So, the remaining irreducible factors must be  $x^{4} + x + 1$ ,  $x^{4} + x^{2} + 1$ , and  $x^{4} + x^{3} + x^{2} + x + 1$  because these are only possibilities that meet the two stated necessary conditions.

LEONARD EUGENE DICKSON was born in Independence, Iowa, on January 22, 1874. In 1896, he received the first Ph.D. to be awarded in mathematics at the University of Chicago. After spending a few years at the University of California and the University of Texas, he was appointed to the faculty at Chicago and remained there until his retirement in 1939.

Dickson was one of the most prolific mathematicians of the 20th century, writing 267 research papers and 18 books. His principal interests were matrix groups, finite fields, algebra, and number theory. Dickson had a disdainful attitude toward applicable mathematics; he would often say, "Thank God that

number theory is unsullied by any applications."

He also had a sense of humor. Dickson would often mention his honeymoon: "It was a great success," he said, "except that I only got two research papers written." Dickson received many honors in his career. He was the first to be awarded the prize from the American Association for the Advancement of Science for the most notable contribution to the advancement of science, and the first to receive the Cole Prize in algebra from the American Mathematical Society. The University of Chicago has research instructorships named after him. Dickson died on January 17, 1954.

# Geometric Constructions

At the age of eleven, I began Euclid. . . . This was one of the great events of my life, as dazzling as first love.

# Historical Discussion of Geometric Constructions

During the 6th and 5th centuries BC the Greeks were masters of geometric constructions. They were especially interested in constructions that could be achieved using only a straightedge without markings and a compass. They knew, for example, that any angle can be bisected, and they knew how to construct an equilateral triangle, a square, a regular pentagon, and a regular hexagon. But they did not know how to trisect every angle or how to construct a regular seven-sided polygon (heptagon). Another problem that they attempted was the duplication of the cube—that is, given any cube, they tried to construct a new cube having twice the volume of the given one using only an unmarked straightedge and a compass. Legend has it that the ancient Athenians were told by the oracle at Delos that a plague would end if they constructed a new altar to Apollo in the shape of a cube with double the volume of the old altar, which was also a cube. Besides "doubling the cube," the Greeks also attempted to "square the circle"—to construct a square with area equal to that of a given circle. They knew how to solve all these problems using other means, such as a compass and a straightedge with two marks, or an unmarked straightedge and a spiral, but they could not achieve any of the constructions with a compass and an unmarked straightedge alone. These problems vexed mathematicians for over 2000 years. The resolution of these perplexities was made possible when they were transferred from questions of geometry to questions of algebra in the 19th century.

The first of the famous problems of antiquity to be solved was that of the construction of regular polygons. It had been known since Euclid that regular polygons with a number of sides of the form  $2^k, 2^k \cdot 3, 2^k \cdot 5$ , and  $2^k \cdot 3 \cdot 5$  could be constructed, and it was believed that no others were possible. In 1796, while still a teenager, Gauss showed that the 17-sided regular polygon is constructible. In 1801, he proved that a regular polygon of  $n$  sides is constructible if and only if  $n$  has the form  $2^k p_1 p_2 \cdots p_i$ , where the  $p$ 's are distinct

primes of the form  $2^{2^s} + 1$ . We provide a proof of this statement in Theorem 31.5.

Thus, regular polygons with 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 17, and 20 sides are possible to construct, whereas those with 7, 9, 11, 13, 14, 18, and 19 sides are not. How these constructions can be effected is another matter. One person spent 10 years trying to determine a way to construct the 65,537-sided polygon.

Gauss's result on the constructibility of regular  $n$ -gons eliminated another of the famous unsolved problems, because the ability to trisect a  $60^{\circ}$  angle enables one to construct a regular 9-gon. Thus, there is no method for trisecting a  $60^{\circ}$  angle with an unmarked straightedge and a compass. In 1837, Wantzel proved that it was not possible to double the cube. The problem of the squaring of a circle resisted all attempts until 1882, when Ferdinand Lindemann proved that  $\pi$  is transcendental, since, as we will show, all constructible numbers are algebraic.

# Constructible Numbers

With the field theory we now have, it is an easy matter to solve the following problem: Given an unmarked straightedge, a compass, and a unit length, what other lengths can be constructed? To begin, we call a real number  $\alpha$  constructible if, by means of an unmarked straightedge, a compass, and a line segment of length 1, we can construct a line segment of length  $|\alpha|$  in a finite number of steps. It follows from plane geometry that if  $\alpha$  and  $\beta (\beta \neq 0)$  are constructible numbers, then so are  $\alpha + \beta, \alpha - \beta, \alpha \cdot \beta$ , and  $\alpha / \beta$ . (See the exercises for hints.) Thus, the set of constructible numbers contains  $Q$  and is a subfield of the real numbers. What we desire is an algebraic characterization of this field. To derive such a characterization, let  $F$  be any subfield of the reals. Call the subset  $\{(x, y) \in R^2 \mid x, y \in F\}$  of the real plane the plane of  $F$ , call any line joining two points in the plane of  $F$  a line in  $F$ , and call any circle whose center is in the plane of  $F$  and whose radius is in  $F$  a circle in  $F$ . Then a line in  $F$  has an equation of the form

$$
a x + b y + c = 0, \quad \text {w h e r e} a, b, c \in F,
$$

and a circle in  $F$  has an equation of the form

$$
x ^ {2} + y ^ {2} + a x + b y + c = 0, \quad \text {w h e r e} a, b, c \in F.
$$

In particular, note that to find the point of intersection of a pair of lines in  $F$  or the points of intersection of a line in  $F$  and a circle in  $F$ , one need only solve a linear or quadratic equation in  $F$ . We now come to the crucial question. Starting with points in the plane of some field  $F$ , which points in the real plane can be obtained with an unmarked straightedge and a compass? Well, there are only three ways to construct points, starting with points in the plane of  $F$ :

1. Intersect two lines in  $F$ .  
2. Intersect a circle in  $F$  and a line in  $F$ .  
3. Intersect two circles in  $F$ .

In case 1, we do not obtain any new points, because two lines in  $F$  intersect in a point in the plane of  $F$ . In case 2, the point of intersection is the solution to either a linear equation in  $F$  or a quadratic equation in  $F$ . So, the point lies in the plane of  $F$  or in the plane of  $F(\sqrt{\alpha})$ , where  $\alpha \in F$  and  $\alpha$  is positive. In case 3, no new points are obtained, because, if the two circles are given by  $x^{2} + y^{2} + ax + by + c = 0$  and  $x^{2} + y^{2} + a'x + b'y + c' = 0$ , then we have  $(a - a')x + (b - b')y + (c - c') = 0$ , which is a line in  $F$ . So, case 3 reduces to case 2.

It follows, then, that the only points in the real plane that can be constructed from the plane of a field  $F$  are those whose coordinates lie in fields of the form  $F(\sqrt{\alpha})$ , where  $\alpha \in F$  and  $\alpha$  is positive. Of course, we can start over with  $F_{1} = F(\sqrt{\alpha})$  and construct points whose coordinates lie in fields of the form  $F_{2} = F_{1}(\sqrt{\beta})$ , where  $\beta \in F_{1}$  and  $\beta$  is positive. Continuing in this fashion we see that a real number  $c$  is constructible if and only if there is a series of fields  $Q = F_{1} \subseteq F_{2} \subseteq \dots \subseteq F_{n} \subseteq \mathbf{R}$  such that  $F_{i + 1} = F_{i}(\sqrt{\alpha_{i}})$ , where  $\alpha_{i} \in F_{i}$  and  $c \in F_{n}$ . Since  $[F_{i + 1}:F_i] = 1$  or 2, we see by Theorem 20.5 that if  $c$  is constructible, then  $[Q(c):Q] = 2^{k}$  for some nonnegative integer  $k$ .

We record this as follows.

# Theorem 22.1 Characterization of Construcible Numbers

A real number  $c$  is constructible if and only if  $[Q(c):Q] = 2^k$  for some nonnegative integer  $k$ .

Re Gauss's proof that a regular 17-gon (heptadecagon) is constructible, he gave the following expression in his book Disquisitiones Arithmeticae published in 1801.

$$
\begin{array}{l} \cos \frac {2 \pi}{1 7} = \frac {1}{1 6} \left(\sqrt {1 7} - 1 + \sqrt {3 4 - 2 \sqrt {1 7}}\right) \\ + \frac {1}{8} \left(\sqrt {1 7 + 3 \sqrt {1 7} - \sqrt {3 4 - 2 \sqrt {1 7}} - 2 \sqrt {3 4 + 2 \sqrt {1 7}}}\right). \\ \end{array}
$$

Figure 22.1 demonstrates the construction of a heptadecagon.

Videos showing a step-by-step construction of a regular 17-gon with a straight edge and compass are available on YouTube.

We now dispatch the problems that plagued the Greeks. Consider doubling the cube of volume 1. The enlarged cube would have an edge of length  $\sqrt[3]{2}$ . But  $[Q(\sqrt[3]{2}):Q] = 3$ , so such a cube cannot be constructed.

Next consider the possibility of trisecting a  $60^{\circ}$  angle. If it were possible to trisect an angle of  $60^{\circ}$ , then  $\cos 20^{\circ}$  would be constructible. (See Figure 22.2.) In particular,  $[Q(\cos 20^{\circ}):Q] = 2^{k}$  for some  $k$ . Now, using the trigonometric

Figure 22.1 Heptadecagon.

identity  $\cos 3\theta = 4\cos^3\theta -3\cos \theta$  , with  $\theta = 20^{\circ}$  , we see that  $1 / 2 = 4\cos^3 20^\circ -$ $3\cos 20^{\circ}$  , so that  $\cos 20^{\circ}$  is a zero of  $8x^{3} - 6x - 1$  . But, since  $8x^{3} - 6x - 1$  is irreducible over  $Q$  (see Exercise 13), we must also have.  $[Q(\cos 20^{\circ}):Q] = 3$  This contradiction shows that trisecting a  $60^{\circ}$  angle is impossible.

# Angle-Trisectors and Circle-Squarers

Down through the centuries, hundreds of people have claimed to have achieved one or more of the impossible constructions. In 1775, the Paris Academy, so overwhelmed with these claims, passed a resolution to no longer examine these claims or claims of machines purported to exhibit perpetual motion. Although it has been more than 100 years since the last of the constructions was shown to be impossible, there continues to be a steady parade of people who claim to have done one or more of them. Most of these people have heard that this is impossible but have refused to believe it. One person insisted that he could trisect any angle with a straightedge alone. Another found his trisection in 1973 after 12,000 hours of work. One got his from God. In 1971, a person with a Ph.D. in mathematics asserted that he had a valid

trisection method. Many people have claimed the hat trick: trisecting the angle, doubling the cube, and squaring the circle. Two men who did this in 1961 succeeded in having their accomplishment noted in the Congressional Record. Occasionally, newspapers and magazines have run stories about "doing the impossible," often giving the impression that the construction may be valid. Many angle-trisectors and circle-squarers have had their work published at their own expense and distributed to colleges and universities. One had his printed in four languages!

Although he never claimed to have squared the circle, the incomparable Renaissance multifaceted genius Leonardo da Vinci made 169 attempts over many years at squaring the circle.

# Sylow Theorems

Generally these three results are implied by the expression "Sylow's Theorem." All of them are of fundamental importance. In fact, if the theorems of group theory were arranged in order of their importance Sylow's Theorem might reasonably occupy the second place—coming next to Lagrange's Theorem in such an arrangement.

G. A. Miller, Theory and Application of Finite Groups

It is impossible to overstate the importance of Sylow's Theorem in the study of finite groups. Without it the subject would not get off the ground.

I. N. Herstein, Abstract Algebra, 3rd ed.

# Conjugacy Classes

In this chapter, we derive several important arithmetic relationships between a group and certain of its subgroups. Recall from Chapter 7 that Lagrange's Theorem was proved by showing that cosets of a subgroup partition the group. Another fruitful method of partitioning the elements of a group is by way of conjugacy classes.

# Definition Conjugacy Class of  $a$

Let  $a$  and  $b$  be elements of a group  $G$ . We say that  $a$  and  $b$  are conjugate in  $G$  (and call  $b$  a conjugate of  $a$ ) if  $xax^{-1} = b$  for some  $x$  in  $G$ . The conjugacy class of  $a$  is the set  $\operatorname{cl}(a) = \{xax^{-1} | x \in G\}$ .

We leave it to the reader (Exercise 1) to prove that conjugacy is an equivalence relation on  $G$ , and that the conjugacy class of  $a$  is the equivalence class of  $a$  under conjugacy. Thus, we may partition any group into disjoint conjugacy classes. Let's look at one example. In  $D_4$  we have

$$
\begin{array}{l} \operatorname {c l} (H) = \left\{R _ {0} H R _ {0} ^ {- 1}, R _ {9 0} H R _ {9 0} ^ {- 1}, R _ {1 8 0} H R _ {1 8 0} ^ {- 1}, R _ {2 7 0} H R _ {2 7 0} ^ {- 1}, \right. \\ H H H ^ {- 1}, V H V ^ {- 1}, D H D ^ {- 1}, D ^ {\prime} H D ^ {\prime - 1} \} = \{H, V \}. \\ \end{array}
$$

Similarly, one may verify that

$$
\operatorname {c l} \left(R _ {0}\right) = \left\{R _ {0} \right\},
$$

$$
\operatorname {c l} \left(R _ {9 0}\right) = \left\{R _ {9 0}, R _ {2 7 0} \right\} = \operatorname {c l} \left(R _ {2 7 0}\right),
$$

$$
\operatorname {c l} \left(R _ {1 8 0}\right) = \left\{R _ {1 8 0} \right\},
$$

$$
\operatorname {c l} (V) = \{V, H \} = \operatorname {c l} (H),
$$

$$
\operatorname {c l} (D) = \left\{D, D ^ {\prime} \right\} = \operatorname {c l} \left(D ^ {\prime}\right).
$$

Theorem 23.1 gives an arithmetic relationship between the size of the conjugacy class of  $a$  and the size of  $C(a) = \{x \in G \mid xa = ax\}$ , the centralizer of  $a$  in  $G$ .

# Theorem 23.1 Number of Conjugates of a

Let  $G$  be a finite group and let  $a$  be an element of  $G$ . Then,  $|\operatorname{cl}(a)| = |G : C(a)|$ .

PROOF Consider the function  $T$  that sends the coset  $xC(a)$  to the conjugate  $xax^{-1}$  of  $a$ . A routine calculation shows that  $T$  is well-defined, is one-to-one, and maps the set of left cosets onto the conjugacy class of  $a$ . Thus, the number of conjugates of  $a$  is the index of the centralizer of  $a$ .

# Corollary 1  $|\operatorname{cl}(a)|$  Divides  $|G|$

In a finite group,  $|\operatorname{cl}(a)|$  divides  $|G|$ .

# The Class Equation

Since the conjugacy classes partition a group, the following important counting principle is a corollary to Theorem 23.1.

# Corollary 2 Class Equation

For any finite group  $G$ ,

$$
| G | = \Sigma | G: C (a) |,
$$

where the sum runs over one element  $a$  from each conjugacy class of  $G$ .

In finite group theory, counting principles such as this corollary are powerful tools. Theorem 23.2 is the single most important fact about finite groups

of prime-power order (a group of order  $p^n$ , where  $p$  is a prime, is called a  $p$ -group).

# Theorem 23.2  $p$ -Groups Have Nontrivial Centers

Let  $G$  be a nontrivial finite group whose order is a power of a prime  $p$ . Then  $Z(G)$  has more than one element.

PROOF First observe that  $\operatorname{cl}(a) = \{a\}$  if and only if  $a \in Z(G)$  (see Exercise 4). Thus, by culling out these elements, we may write the class equation in the form

$$
| G | = | Z (G) | + \Sigma | G: C (a) |,
$$

where the sum runs over representatives of all conjugacy classes with more than one element (this set may be empty). But  $|G:C(a)| = |G| / |C(a)|$ , so each term in  $\sum |G:C(a)|$  has the form  $p^k$  with  $k \geq 1$ . Hence,

$$
| G | - \Sigma | G: C (a) | = | Z (G) |,
$$

where each term on the left is divisible by  $p$ . It follows, then, that  $p$  also divides  $|Z(G)|$ , and hence  $|Z(G)| \neq 1$ .

Recall that a corollary of Theorem 9.8 is that groups of  $p^2$  where  $p$  is a prime are Abelian. This result is also a corollary of Theorem 23.2.

# Corollary Groups of Order  $p^2$  Are Abelian

If  $|G| = p^2$ , where  $p$  is prime, then  $G$  is Abelian.

PROOF By Theorem 23.2 and Lagrange's Theorem,  $|Z(G)| = p$  or  $p^2$ . If  $|Z(G)| = p^2$ , then  $G = Z(G)$  and  $G$  is Abelian. If  $|Z(G)| = p$ , then  $|G / Z(G)| = p$ , so that  $G / Z(G)$  is cyclic. But, then, by Theorem 9.3,  $G$  is Abelian.

# The Sylow Theorems

Now to the Sylow theorems. Recall that the converse of Lagrange's Theorem is false; that is, if  $G$  is a group of order  $m$  and  $n$  divides  $m$ ,  $G$  need not have a subgroup of order  $n$ . Our next theorem is a partial converse of Lagrange's Theorem. It, as well as Theorem 23.2, was first proved by the Norwegian mathematician Ludwig Sylow (1832-1918). Sylow's Theorem and Lagrange's Theorem are the two most important results in finite group theory. The first gives a sufficient condition for the existence of subgroups, and the second gives a necessary condition.

Theorem 23.3 Existence of Subgroups of Prime-Power Order (Sylow's First Theorem, 1872)

Let  $G$  be a finite group and let  $p$  be a prime. If  $p^k$  divides  $|G|$ , then  $G$  has at least one subgroup of order  $p^k$ .

PROOF We proceed by induction on  $|G|$ . If  $|G| = 1$ , Theorem 23.3 is trivially true. Now assume that the statement is true for all groups of order less than  $|G|$ . If  $G$  has a proper subgroup  $H$  such that  $p^k$  divides  $|H|$ , then, by our inductive assumption,  $H$  has a subgroup of order  $p^k$  and we are done. Thus, we may henceforth assume that  $p^k$  does not divide the order of any proper subgroup of  $G$ . Next, consider the class equation for  $G$  in the form

$$
| G | = | Z (G) | + \sum | G: C (a) |,
$$

where we sum over a representative of each conjugacy class  $\operatorname{cl}(a)$ , where  $a \notin Z(G)$ . Since  $p^k$  divides  $|G| = |G : C(a)||C(a)|$  and  $p^k$  does not divide  $|C(a)|$ , we know that  $p$  must divide  $|G : C(a)|$  for all  $a \notin Z(G)$ . It then follows from the class equation that  $p$  divides  $|Z(G)|$ . The Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups (Theorem 11.1), or Cauchy's theorem for finite Abelian groups (Theorem 9.5), then guarantees that  $Z(G)$  contains an element of order  $p$ , say  $x$ . Since  $x$  is in the center of  $G$ ,  $\langle x \rangle$  is a normal subgroup of  $G$ , and we may form the factor group  $G / \langle x \rangle$ . Now observe that  $p^{k-1}$  divides  $|G / \langle x \rangle|$ . Thus, by the induction hypothesis,  $G / \langle x \rangle$  has a subgroup of order  $p^{k-1}$  and, by Exercise 59 in Chapter 10, this subgroup has the form  $H / \langle x \rangle$ , where  $H$  is a subgroup of  $G$ . Finally, note that  $|H / \langle x \rangle| = p^{k-1}$  and  $|\langle x \rangle| = p$  imply that  $|H| = p^k$ . Thus, we have produced a subgroup of order  $p^k$ , which contradicts our assumption that no such subgroup exists. Therefore, we must have originally had a subgroup of order  $p^k$ , and we can apply the induction hypothesis to that subgroup.

Let's be sure we understand exactly what Sylow's First Theorem means. Say we have a group  $G$  of order  $2^3 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^4 \cdot 7$ . Then Sylow's First Theorem says that  $G$  must have at least one subgroup of each of the following orders: 2, 4, 8, 3, 9, 5, 25, 125, 625, and 7. On the other hand, Sylow's First Theorem tells us nothing about the possible existence of subgroups of order 6, 10, 15, 30, or any other divisor of  $|G|$  that has two or more distinct prime factors. Because certain subgroups guaranteed by Sylow's First Theorem play a central role in the theory of finite groups, they are given a special name.

# Definition Sylow  $p$ -Subgroup

Let  $G$  be a finite group and let  $p$  be a prime. If  $p^k$  divides  $|G|$  and  $p^{k+1}$  does not divide  $|G|$ , then any subgroup of  $G$  of order  $p^k$  is called a Sylow  $p$ -subgroup of  $G$ .<sup>4</sup>

So, returning to our group  $G$  of order  $2^3 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5^4 \cdot 7$ , we call any subgroup of order 8 a Sylow 2-subgroup of  $G$ , any subgroup of order 625 a Sylow

5-subgroup of  $G$ , and so on. Notice that a Sylow  $p$ -subgroup of  $G$  is a subgroup whose order is the largest power of  $p$  consistent with Lagrange's Theorem.

Since any subgroup of order  $p$  is cyclic, we have the following generalization of Theorem 9.5, first proved by Cauchy in 1845. His proof ran nine pages!

# Corollary Cauchy's Theorem

Let  $G$  be a finite group and let  $p$  be a prime that divides the order of  $G$ . Then  $G$  has an element of order  $p$ .

Sylow's First Theorem is so fundamental to finite group theory that many different proofs of it have been published over the years [our proof is essentially the one given by Georg Frobenius (1849-1917) in 1895]. Likewise, there are scores of generalizations of Sylow's Theorem.

Observe that the corollary to the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups and Sylow's First Theorem show that the converse of Lagrange's Theorem is true for all finite Abelian groups and all finite groups of prime-power order.

There are two more Sylow theorems that are extremely valuable tools in finite group theory. But first we introduce a new term and recall two concepts.

# Definition Conjugate Subgroups

Let  $H$  and  $K$  be subgroups of a group  $G$ . We say that  $H$  and  $K$  are conjugate in  $G$  if there is an element  $g$  in  $G$  such that  $H = gKg^{-1}$ .

Recall from Chapter 7 that if  $G$  is a finite group of permutations on a set  $S$  and  $i \in S$ , then  $\operatorname{orb}_G(i) = \{\phi(i) \mid \phi \in G\}$  and  $|\operatorname{orb}_G(i)|$  divides  $|G|$ . For a subgroup  $H$  of a group  $G$ , the normalizer of  $H$  in  $G$ , is the subgroup  $N(H) = \{x \in G \mid xHx^{-1} = H\}$ .

# Theorem 23.4 Sylow's Second Theorem

If  $H$  is a subgroup of a finite group  $G$  and  $|H|$  is a power of a prime  $p$ , then  $H$  is contained in some Sylow  $p$ -subgroup of  $G$ .

PROOF Let  $K$  be a Sylow  $p$ -subgroup of  $G$  and let  $C = \{K_1, K_2, \ldots, K_n\}$  with  $K = K_1$  be the set of all conjugates of  $K$  in  $G$ . Since conjugation is an automorphism, each element of  $C$  is a Sylow  $p$ -subgroup of  $G$ . Let  $S_C$  denote the group of all permutations of  $C$ . For each  $g \in G$ , define  $\phi_g: C \to C$  by  $\phi_g(K_i) = gK_i g^{-1}$ . It is easy to show that each  $\phi_g \in S_C$ .

Now define a mapping  $T: G \to S_C$  by  $T(g) = \phi_g$ . Since  $\phi_{gh}(K_i) = (gh)K_i(gh)^{-1} = g(hK_ih^{-1})g^{-1} = g\phi_h(K_i)g^{-1} = \phi_g(\phi_h(K_i)) = (\phi_g\phi_h)(K_i)$ , we have  $\phi_{gh} = \phi_g\phi_h$ , and therefore  $T$  is a homomorphism from  $G$  to  $S_C$ .

Next consider  $T(H)$ , the image of  $H$  under  $T$ . Since  $|H|$  is a power of  $p$ , so is  $|T(H)|$  (see property 6 of Theorem 10.2). Thus, by the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem (Theorem 7.4), for each  $i$ ,  $|\mathrm{orb}_{T(H)}(K_i)|$  divides  $|T(H)|$ ,

so that  $|\operatorname{orb}_{T(H)}(K_i)|$  is a power of  $p$ . Now we ask: Under what condition does  $|\operatorname{orb}_{T(H)}(K_i)| = 1$ ? Well,  $|\operatorname{orb}_{T(H)}(K_i)| = 1$  means that  $\phi_g(K_i) = gK_ig^{-1} = K_i$  for all  $g \in H$ ; that is,  $|\operatorname{orb}_{T(H)}(K_i)| = 1$  if and only if  $H \leq N(K_i)$ . But the only elements of  $N(K_i)$  that have orders that are powers of  $p$  are those of  $K_i$  (see Exercise 17). Thus,  $|\operatorname{orb}_{T(H)}(K_i)| = 1$  if and only if  $H \leq K_i$ .

So, to complete the proof, all we need to do is show that for some  $i$ ,  $|\mathrm{orb}_{T(H)}(K_i)| = 1$ . Analogous to Theorem 23.1, we have  $|C| = |G:N(K)|$  (see Exercise 9). And since  $|G:K| = |G:N(K)||N(K):K|$  is not divisible by  $p$ , neither is  $|C|$ . Because the orbits partition  $C$ ,  $|C|$  is the sum of powers of  $p$ . If no orbit has size 1, then  $p$  divides each summand and, therefore,  $p$  divides  $|C|$ , which is a contradiction. Thus, there is an orbit of size 1, and the proof is complete.

# Theorem 23.5 Sylow's Third Theorem

Let  $p$  be a prime and let  $G$  be a group of order  $p^k m$ , where  $p$  does not divide  $m$ . Then the number  $n$  of Sylow  $p$ -subgroups of  $G$  is equal to 1 modulo  $p$  and divides  $m$ . Furthermore, any two Sylow  $p$ -subgroups of  $G$  are conjugate.

PROOF Let  $K$  be any Sylow  $p$ -subgroup of  $G$  and let  $C = \{K_1, K_2, \ldots, K_n\}$ , with  $K = K_1$ , be the set of all conjugates of  $K$  in  $G$ . We first prove that  $n \mod p = 1$ .

Let  $S_{C}$  and  $T$  be as in the proof of Theorem 23.4. This time we consider  $T(K)$ , the image of  $K$  under  $T$ . As before, we have  $|\operatorname{orb}_{T(K)}(K_i)|$  is a power of  $p$  for each  $i$  and  $|\operatorname{orb}_{T(K)}(K_i)| = 1$  if and only if  $K \leq K_i$ . Thus,  $|\operatorname{orb}_{T(K)}(K_1)| = 1$  and  $|\operatorname{orb}_{T(K)}(K_i)|$  is a power of  $p$  greater than 1 for all  $i \neq 1$ . Since the orbits partition  $C$ , it follows that, modulo  $p$ ,  $n = |C| = 1$ .

Next we show that every Sylow  $p$ -subgroup of  $G$  belongs to  $C$ . To do this, suppose that  $H$  is a Sylow  $p$ -subgroup of  $G$  that is not in  $C$ . Let  $S_{C}$  and  $T$  be as in the proof of Theorem 23.4, and this time consider  $T(H)$ . As in the previous paragraph,  $|C|$  is the sum of the orbits' sizes under the action of  $T(H)$ . However, no orbit has size 1, since  $H$  is not in  $C$ . Thus,  $|C|$  is a sum of terms each divisible by  $p$ , so that, modulo  $p$ ,  $n = |C| = 0$ . This contradiction proves that  $H$  belongs to  $C$ , and that  $n$  is the number of Sylow  $p$ -subgroups of  $G$ .

Finally, that  $n$  divides  $m$  follows directly from the fact that  $n = |G : N(K)|$  (see Exercise 9) and  $n$  is relatively prime to  $p$ .

Sylow's third theorem is reminiscent of Lagrange's Theorem in that it provides a list of candidates for the possible number of Sylow  $p$ -subgroups. Here is how to use it. For convenience let  $n_p$  denote the number of Sylow  $p$ -subgroups of a group  $G$  of order  $p^n m$ , where  $p$  is a prime that does not divide  $m$ . First note that  $n_p = 1$  is always possible since 1 divides  $m$  and 1 is 1 mod  $p$ . Also, all divisors  $d$  of  $m$  are possible values of  $n_2$ , because such  $d$  will be odd and therefore  $d = 1 \mod 2$ . For odd primes  $p$ , the possibilities for  $n_p > 1$  are the divisors  $d > 1$  for which  $p$  divides  $d - 1$ , for then  $d - 1 = pt$  for some integer  $t$ . To illustrate this consider  $n = 2 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 11$ . For  $n_2$ , all divisors

of  $5^2 \cdot 11$  are possibilities for  $n_2$ . For  $n_5$ , only  $d = 1$  and  $d = 11$  satisfy the condition that 11 divides  $d - 1$ . (Note that you need not bother considering any divisor  $d$  of  $m$  with  $1 < d - 1 < 11$ .) For  $n_{11}$ , only  $d = 1$  satisfies the condition that 11 divides  $d - 1$ .

Unlike Lagrange's Theorem, which eliminates some possible orders for subgroups of a finite group, Sylow's first and second theorems guarantee the existence of many important aspects of a finite group. Moreover, the three Sylow theorems provide great insights into the inner workings of finite groups. This will be made evident in the remainder of this chapter and the next chapter.

As two important consequences of Sylow's Third Theorem, we have the following corollaries.

# ■ Corollary 1 Criterion for a Unique Sylow  $p$ -Subgroup

A Sylow  $p$ -sugroup is unique if and only if it is normal.

PROOF Note that a Sylow  $p$ -subgroup  $H$  of a group  $G$  is a normal in  $G$  if and only if  $xHx^{-1} = H$  for all  $x$  in  $G$ . Then, because all Sylow  $p$ -subgroups of  $G$  are conjugate to  $H$ ,  $H$  is normal in  $G$  if and only if it is the only Sylow  $p$ -subgroup of  $G$ .

# ■ Corollary 2 Order of the Normalizer of a Sylow  $p$ -subgroup

If  $H$  is a Sylow  $p$ -subgroup of a group  $G$ , the number of Sylow  $p$ -subgroups in  $G$  is  $|G:|N(H)|$ . Moreover,  $|N(H)| = |G| / n_p$ .

PROOF See Exercise 9.

We illustrate Sylow's Second Theorem with three examples.

EXAMPLE 1 Consider the Sylow 2-subgroups of  $S_3$ . They are  $\{(1), (12)\}$ ,  $\{(1), (23)\}$ , and  $\{(1), (13)\}$ . According to Sylow's Third Theorem, we should be able to obtain the latter two of these from the first by conjugation. Indeed,

$$
(1 3) \{(1), (1 2) \} (1 3) ^ {- 1} = \{(1), (2 3) \},
$$

$$
(2 3) \{(1), (1 2) \} (2 3) ^ {- 1} = \{(1), (1 3) \}.
$$

EXAMPLE 2 Consider the Sylow 3-subgroups of  $A_4$ . They are  $\{\alpha_1, \alpha_5, \alpha_9\}$ ,  $\{\alpha_1, \alpha_6, \alpha_{11}\}$ ,  $\{\alpha_1, \alpha_7, \alpha_{12}\}$ , and  $\{\alpha_1, \alpha_8, \alpha_{10}\}$ . (See Table 5.1.) Then,

$$
\alpha_ {2} \left\{\alpha_ {1}, \alpha_ {5}, \alpha_ {9} \right\} \alpha_ {2} ^ {- 1} = \left\{\alpha_ {1}, \alpha_ {7}, \alpha_ {1 2} \right\},
$$

$$
\alpha_ {3} \left\{\alpha_ {1}, \alpha_ {5}, \alpha_ {9} \right\} \alpha_ {3} ^ {- 1} = \left\{\alpha_ {1}, \alpha_ {8}, \alpha_ {1 0} \right\},
$$

$$
\alpha_ {4} \{\alpha_ {1}, \alpha_ {5}, \alpha_ {9} \} \alpha_ {4} ^ {- 1} = \{\alpha_ {1}, \alpha_ {6}, \alpha_ {1 1} \}.
$$

Thus, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups is 1 modulo 3, and the four Sylow 3-subgroups are conjugate.

Figure 23.1 Lattices of subgroups for  $S_{3}$  and  $A_{4}$ .

Figure 23.1 shows the subgroup lattices for  $S_{3}$  and  $A_{4}$ . We have connected the Sylow  $p$ -groups with dashed circles to indicate that they belong to one orbit under conjugation. Notice that the three subgroups of order 2 in  $A_{4}$  are contained in a Sylow 2-group, as required by Sylow's Second Theorem. As it happens, these three subgroups also belong to one orbit under conjugation, but this is not a consequence of Sylow's Third Theorem.

In contrast to the two preceding examples, observe that the dihedral group of order 12 has seven subgroups of order 2, but that conjugating  $\{R_0,R_{180}\}$  does not yield any of the other six. (Why?)

Finally, let's dispatch with the Sylow 2-subgroups of  $S_4$ .

EXAMPLE 3 By the Sylow theorems,  $S_4$  has one or three subgroups of order 8. By Example 3 in Chapter 5, one of them is  $H_1 = \langle (1234), (12)(34) \rangle$ , which is isomorphic to  $D_4$ . Because  $D_4$  has exactly two elements of order 4 (namely, (1234) and  $(1234)^{-1} = (4321)$ ) and  $S_4$  has  $4! / 4 = 6$  elements of order 4,  $S_4$  has three Sylow 2-subgroups and we can distinguish them by their elements of order 4. Since (123)(1234)(123)^{-1} = (1423) is not in  $H_1$  we have  $H_2 = (123)H_1(123)^{-1}$  is a second Sylow 2-subgroup of  $S_4$ . Likewise, because (124)(1234)(124)^{-1} = (1243) is not in  $H_1$  or  $H_2$ , we know that  $H_3 = (124)H_1(124)^{-1}$  is the third Sylow 2-subgroup of  $S_4$ .

# Applications of Sylow Theorems

A few numerical examples will make the Sylow theorems come to life.

EXAMPLE 4 Say  $G$  is a group of order 40. What do the Sylow theorems tell us about  $G$ ? A great deal! Since 1 is the only divisor of 40 that is congruent to 1 modulo 5, we know that  $G$  has exactly one subgroup of order 5, and therefore it is normal. Similarly,  $G$  has either one or five subgroups of order 8. If there is only one subgroup of order 8, it is normal. If there are five subgroups of order 8, none is normal and all five can be obtained by starting with any particular one, say  $H$ , and computing  $xHx^{-1}$  for various  $x$ 's. Finally, if we let  $K$  denote the normal subgroup of order 5 and let  $H$  denote any subgroup of order 8, then  $G = HK$ . (See Example 5 in Chapter 9.) If  $H$  happens to be normal, we can say even more:  $G = H \times K$ .

EXAMPLE 5 Consider a group of order 30. By Sylow's Third Theorem, it must have either one or six subgroups of order 5 and one or 10 subgroups of order 3. However,  $G$  cannot have both six subgroups of order 5 and 10 subgroups of order 3 (for then  $G$  would have more than 30 elements). Thus, the subgroup of order 3 is unique or the subgroup of order 5 is unique (or both are unique) and therefore is normal in  $G$ . It follows, then, that the product of a subgroup of order 3 and one of order 5 is a group of order 15 that is both cyclic (Exercise 35) and normal (Exercise 9 in Chapter 9) in  $G$ . [This, in turn, implies that both the subgroup of order 3 and the subgroup of order 5 are normal in  $G$  (Exercise 59 in Chapter 9).] So, if we let  $y$  be a generator of the cyclic subgroup of order 15 and let  $x$  be an element of order 2 (the existence of which is guaranteed by Cauchy's Theorem), we see that  $G = \{x^i y^j \mid 0 \leq i \leq 1, 0 \leq j \leq 14\}$ .

EXAMPLE 6 We show that any group  $G$  of order 72 must have a proper, nontrivial normal subgroup. Our arguments are a preview of those in Chapter 24. By Sylow's Third Theorem, the number of Sylow 3-subgroups of  $G$  is equal to 1 mod 3 and divides 8. Thus, the number is 1 or 4. If there is only one, then it is normal by the corollary of Sylow's Third Theorem. Otherwise, let  $H$  and  $H'$  be two distinct Sylow 3-subgroups. By Theorem 7.2, we have that  $|HH'| = |H||H'| / |H \cap H'| = 81 / |H \cap H'|$ . Since  $|G| = 72$  and  $|H \cap H'|$  is a subgroup of  $H$  and  $H'$ , we know that  $|H \cap H'| = 3$ . By the corollary to Theorem 23.2,  $N(H \cap H')$  contains both  $H$  and  $H'$ . Thus,  $|N(H \cap H')|$  divides 72, is divisible by 9, and has at least  $|HH'| = 27$  elements. This leaves only 36 or 72 for  $|N(H \cap H')|$ . In the first case, we have from Exercise 9 of Chapter 9 that  $N(H \cap H')$  is normal in  $G$ . In the second case, we have by definition that  $H \cap H'$  is normal in  $G$ .

Note that in these examples we were able to deduce all of this information from knowing only the order of the group—so many conclusions from one assumption! This is the beauty of finite group theory.

In Chapter 7 we saw that the only group (up to isomorphism) of prime order  $p$  is  $Z_{p}$  and the argument given in Example 20 of Chapter 10 (see Exercise 71 of Chapter 10) shows that for primes  $p$  and  $q$  with  $p < q$ , where  $p$  does not divide  $q - 1$ , the only group of order  $pq$  is  $Z_{pq}$  (up to isomorphism).

As a further illustration of the power of the Sylow theorems, we next give another proof of the latter statement.<sup>5</sup> See https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Semidirect_product

# Theorem 23.6 Cyclic Groups of Order pq

If  $G$  is a group of order  $pq$ , where  $p$  and  $q$  are primes,  $p < q$ , and  $p$  does not divide  $q - 1$ , then  $G$  is cyclic. In particular,  $G$  is isomorphic to  $Z_{pq}$ .

PROOF Let  $H$  be a Sylow  $p$ -subgroup of  $G$  and let  $K$  be a Sylow  $q$ -subgroup of  $G$ . Sylow's Third Theorem states that the number of Sylow  $p$ -subgroups of  $G$  is of the form  $1 + kp$  and divides  $q$ . So  $1 + kp = 1$  or  $1 + kp = q$ . Since  $p$  does not divide  $q - 1$ , we have that  $k = 0$  and therefore  $H$  is the only Sylow  $p$ -subgroup of  $G$ .

Similarly, there is only one Sylow  $q$ -subgroup of  $G$  (see Exercise 25). Thus, by the corollary to Theorem 23.5,  $H$  and  $K$  are normal subgroups of  $G$ . Moreover, from Theorem 7.2 and Lagrange, we have  $G = HK$  and  $H \cap K = \{e\}$ . This tells us that  $G = H \times K$ . Finally, by Theorem 8.2,  $G \approx Z_p \oplus Z_q \approx Z_{pq}$ .

Theorem 23.6 demonstrates the power of the Sylow theorems in classifying the finite groups whose orders have small numbers of prime factors. Similar results exist for groups of orders  $p^2 q, p^2 q^2, p^3$ , and  $p^4$ , where  $p$  and  $q$  are prime.

For your amusement, Figure 23.2 lists the number of nonisomorphic groups with order at most 100. Note in particular the large number of groups of order 64. Also observe that, generally speaking, it is not the size of the group that gives rise to a large number of groups of that size but the number of prime factors involved. In all, there are 1047 nonisomorphic groups with 100 or fewer elements. Contrast this with the fact that there are 49,487,365,422 groups of order  $1024 = 2^{10}$ . The number of groups of any order less than 2048 is given at http://oeis.org/A000001/b000001.txt.

As a final application of the Sylow theorems, you might enjoy seeing a determination of the groups of order 45, 66, and 255 In fact, our arguments serve as a good review of much of our work in group theory.

# EXAMPLE 7 Determination of the Groups of Order 45

Suppose that  $G$  is a group of order 45. Let  $H$  be a Sylow 3-subgroup of  $G$  and let  $K$  be a Sylow 5-subgroup of  $G$ . Since 1 is the only positive divisor of 45 that is equal to 1 modulo 5, we know from Sylow's Third Theorem and its corollary that  $K$  is normal in  $G$ . Similarly,  $H$  is normal in  $G$ . It follows, by the argument used in the proof of Theorem 23.6, that  $G = H \times K$ . Since both  $H$  and  $K$  are Abelian,  $G$  is also Abelian. Thus,  $G$  is isomorphic to  $Z_{45}$  or  $Z_{3} \oplus Z_{3} \oplus Z_{5}$ .

# EXAMPLE 8 Determination of the Groups of Order 66

Suppose that  $G$  is a group of order 66. Let  $H$  be a Sylow 3-subgroup of  $G$  and let  $K$  be a Sylow 11-subgroup of  $G$ . Since 1 is the only positive divisor of 66 that is equal to 1 modulo 11, we know that  $K$  is normal in  $G$ . Thus,  $HK$  is a subgroup of  $G$  of order 33 (see Example 5 in Chapter 9 and Theorem 7.2). Since any group of order 33 is cyclic (Theorem 23.6), we may write  $HK = \langle x \rangle$ . Next, let  $y \in G$  and  $|y| = 2$ . Since  $\langle x \rangle$  has index 2 in  $G$ , we know it is normal. So  $yxy^{-1} = x^i$  for some  $i$  from 1 to 32. Then,  $yx = x^i y$  and, since every member of  $G$  is of the form  $x^s y^t$ , the structure of  $G$  is completely determined by the value of  $i$ . We claim that there are only four possibilities for  $i$ . To prove this, observe that  $|x^i| = |x|$ . Thus,  $i$  and 33 are relatively prime. But also, since  $y$  has order 2,

$$
x = y ^ {- 1} \left(y x y ^ {- 1}\right) y = y ^ {- 1} x ^ {i} y = y x ^ {i} y ^ {- 1} = \left(y x y ^ {- 1}\right) i = \left(x ^ {i}\right) i = x ^ {i ^ {2}}.
$$

So  $x^{i^2 - 1} = e$  and therefore 33 divides  $i^2 - 1$ . From this it follows that 11 divides  $i \pm 1$ , and therefore  $i = 0 \pm 1, i = 11 \pm 1, i = 22 \pm 1$ , or  $i = 33 \pm 1$ . Putting this together with the other information we have about  $i$ , we see that  $i = 1, 10, 23$ , or 32. This proves that there are at most four groups of order 66.

To prove that there are exactly four such groups, we simply observe that  $Z_{66}, D_{33}, D_{11} \oplus Z_3$ , and  $D_3 \oplus Z_{11}$  each has order 66 and that no two are isomorphic. For example,  $D_{11} \oplus Z_3$  has 11 elements of order 2, whereas  $D_3 \oplus Z_{11}$  has only three elements of order 2.

# EXAMPLE 9 The Only Group of Order 255 is  $Z_{255}$

Let  $G$  be a group of order  $255 = 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 17$ , and let  $H$  be a Sylow 17-subgroup of  $G$ ,  $K$  a Sylow 5-subgroup of  $G$ , and  $L$  a Sylow 5-subgroup of  $G$ . By Theorem 9.6 and Corollary 1 of Theorem 8.2, it suffices to show that  $H, K$ , and  $L$  are normal subgroups, for then  $G$  is isomorphic to  $H \oplus K \oplus L$ , which is cyclic. By Sylow's Third Theorem,  $H$  is the only Sylow 17-subgroup of  $G$  and therefore  $H$  is a normal subgroup of  $G$ . Then, by Example 5 in Chapter 9 and Theorem 23.6, we have that  $HK$  and  $HL$  are cyclic subgroups of  $G$  of orders 85 and 51,

respectively. Since  $HK$  is cyclic and contains  $H$  and  $K$ , we know that  $C(H)$  contains  $H$  and  $K$ . Likewise,  $HL$  contains  $H$  and  $L$ , and therefore,  $C(H)$  contains  $L$ . This means that 225 divides  $|C(H)|$  and  $C(H) = G$ . Thus, 17 divides  $|Z(G)|$ , which in turn divides 255. So,  $|Z(G)|$  must be one of 17, 51, 85, or 255 and  $|G / Z(G)|$  is one of 15, 5, 3, or 1. But groups of orders 15, 5, 3, or 1 are cyclic, so we know that  $G / Z(G)$  is cyclic. Finally, the  $G / Z$  Theorem (Theorem 9.3) shows that  $G$  is Abelian and it follows from the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian groups that  $G$  is cyclic.

LUDWIG SYLOW (pronounced "SEE-loe) was born on December 12, 1832, in Christiania (now Oslo), Norway. While a student at Christiania University, Sylow won a gold medal for competitive problem solving. In 1855, he became a high school teacher; despite the long hours required by his teaching duties, Sylow found time to study the papers of Abel. During the school year 1862-1863, Sylow received a temporary appointment at Christiania University and gave lectures on Galois theory and permutation groups. Among his students that year was the great mathematician Sophus Lie (pronounced "Lee"), after whom Lie algebras and Lie groups are named. From 1873 to 1881, Sylow, with some help from Lie, prepared a new edition of Abel's works.

In 1902, Sylow and Elling Holst published Abel's correspondence. Sylow's spectacular theorems came in 1872. Upon learning of Sylow's discovery, Jordan called it "one of the essential points in the theory of permutations." The results took on greater importance when the theory of abstract groups flowered in the late 19th century and early 20th century.

In 1869, Sylow was offered a professorship at Christiania University but turned it down. Upon Sylow's retirement from high school teaching at age 65, Lie mounted a successful campaign to establish a chair for Sylow at Christiania University. Sylow held this position until his death on September 7, 1918.

# Finite Simple Groups

It is a widely held opinion that the problem of classifying finite simple groups is close to a complete solution. This will certainly be one of the great achievements of mathematics of this century.

Nathan Jacobson

It's supposed to be hard. If it wasn't hard, everyone would do it. The hard is what makes it great.

Jimmy Dugan from A League of Their Own

# Historical Background

We now come to the El Dorado of finite group theory—the simple groups. Simple group theory is a vast and difficult subject; we call it the El Dorado of group theory because of the enormous effort put forth by hundreds of mathematicians over many years to discover and classify all finite simple groups. Let's begin our discussion with the definition of a simple group and some historical background.

# Definition Simple Group

A group is simple if its only normal subgroups are the identity subgroup and the group itself.

The notion of a simple group was introduced by Galois about 190 years ago. The simplicity of  $A_{5}$ , the group of even permutations on five symbols, played a crucial role in his proof that there is not a solution by radicals of the general fifth-degree polynomial (i.e., there is no "quintic formula"). But what makes simple groups important in the theory of groups? They are important because they play a role in group theory somewhat analogous to that of primes in number theory or the elements in chemistry; that is, they serve as the building blocks for all groups. These building blocks may be determined in the following way. Given a finite group  $G$ , choose a proper normal subgroup  $G_{1}$  of  $G = G_{0}$  of largest order. Then the factor group  $G_{0} / G_{1}$  is simple, and we next choose a proper normal subgroup  $G_{2}$  of  $G_{1}$  of largest order. Then  $G_{1} / G_{2}$  is also simple, and we continue in this fashion until we arrive at  $G_{n} = \{e\}$ . The simple groups  $G_{0} / G_{1}, G_{1} / G_{2}, \ldots, G_{n - 1} / G_{n}$  are called the composition factors of  $G$ . More than 100 years ago, Jordan and Hölder proved that these factors are independent of the choices of the normal subgroups made in the process described. In a certain sense, a group can be reconstructed from its composition factors, and many of the properties of a group are determined by

the nature of its composition factors. This and the fact that many questions about finite groups can be reduced (by induction) to questions about simple groups make clear the importance of determining all finite simple groups.

Just which groups are the simple ones? The Abelian simple groups are precisely  $Z_{n}$ , where  $n = 1$  or  $n$  is prime. This follows directly from the corollary in Chapter 11. In contrast, it is extremely difficult to describe the non-Abelian simple groups. Their discovery began slowly and aimlessly. The best we can do here is to give a few examples and mention a few words about their discovery. It was Galois in 1831 who first observed that  $A_{n}$  is simple for all  $n \geq 5$ . The next discoveries were made by Jordan in 1870, when he found four infinite families of simple matrix groups over the field  $Z_{p}$ , where  $p$  is prime. One such family is the factor group  $SL(n,Z_p) / Z(SL(n,Z_p))$ , except when  $n = 2$  and  $p = 2$  or  $p = 3$ . Between the years 1892 and 1905, the American mathematician Leonard Dickson (see Chapter 21 for a biography) generalized Jordan's results to arbitrary finite fields and discovered several new infinite families of simple groups. About the same time, it was shown by G. A. Miller and F. N. Cole that a family of five groups first described by E. Mathieu in 1861 were in fact simple groups. Since these five groups were constructed by ad hoc methods that did not yield infinitely many possibilities, like  $A_{n}$  or the matrix groups over finite fields, they were called "sporadic."

The next important discoveries came in the 1950s. In that decade, many new infinite families of simple groups were found, and the initial steps down the long and winding road that led to the complete classification of all finite simple groups were taken. The first step was Richard Brauer's observation that the centralizer of an element of order 2 was an important tool for studying simple groups. A few years later, John Thompson, in his Ph.D. dissertation, introduced the crucial idea of studying the normalizers of various subgroups of prime-power order.

In the early 1960s came the momentous Feit-Thompson Theorem, which says that a non-Abelian simple group must have even order. This property was first conjectured around 1900 by one of the pioneers of modern group theoretic methods, the Englishman William Burnside (see Chapter 27 for a biography). The proof of the Feit-Thompson Theorem filled an entire issue of a journal, 255 pages in all (see Figure 24.1). Writing in 2001, simple group theory expert Ronald Solomon said the theorem and its proof were "a moment in the evolution of finite group theory analogous to the emergence of fish onto dry land."

This result provided the impetus to classify the finite simple groups—that is, a program to discover all finite simple groups and prove that there are no more to be found. Throughout the 1960s, the methods introduced in the Feit-Thompson proof were generalized and improved with great success by many mathematicians. Moreover, between 1966 and 1975, 19 new sporadic simple groups were discovered. Despite many spectacular achievements, research in simple group theory in the 1960s was haphazard, and the decade ended with many people believing that the classification would never be completed. (The pessimists feared that the sporadic simple groups would foil all attempts. The

anonymously written "song" on the next page captures the spirit of the times.) Others, more optimistic, were predicting that it would be accomplished in the 1990s.

—Oh, what are the orders of all simple groups?

I speak of the honest ones, not of the loops.

It seems that old Burnside their orders has guessed

Except for the cyclic ones, even the rest.

CHORUS: Finding all groups that are simple is no simple task.

Groups made up with permutes will produce some more:

For  $A_{n}$  is simple, if  $n$  exceeds 4.

Then, there was Sir Matthew who came into view

Exhibiting groups of an order quite new.

Still others have come on to study this thing. Of Artin and Chevalley now we shall sing. With matrices finite they made quite a list The question is: Could there be others they've missed?

Suzuki and Ree then maintained it's the case

That these methods had not reached the end of the chase.

They wrote down some matrices, just four by four.

That made up a simple group. Why not make more?

And then came the opus of Thompson and Feit

Which shed on the problem remarkable light. A group, when the order

won't factor by two, Is cyclic or solvable. That's what is true.

Suzuki and Ree had caused eyebrows to raise. But the theoreticians they just couldn't faze. Their groups were not new: if you added a twist,

You could get them from old ones with a flick of the wrist.

Still, some hardy souls felt a thorn in their side.

For the five groups of Mathieu all reason defied;

Not  $A_{n}$ , not twisted, and not Chevalley, They called them sporadic and filed them away.

Are Mathieu groups creatures of heaven or hell?

Zvonimir Janko determined to tell.

He found out [a new sporadic simple group] that nobody wanted to know:

The masters had missed 1 7 5 5 6 0.

The floodgates were opened! New groups were the rage!

(And twelve or more sprouted, to greet the new age.)

By Janko and Conway and Fischer and Held, McLaughlin, Suzuki, and Higman, and Sims.

No doubt you noted the last lines don't rhyme.

Well, that is, quite simply, a sign of the time.

There's chaos, not order, among simple groups;

And maybe we'd better go back to the loops.

The 1970s began with Thompson receiving the Fields Medal for his fundamental contributions to simple group theory. This honor is among the highest forms of recognition that a mathematician can receive (more information about the Fields Medal is given near the end of this chapter). Within a few years, three major events took place that ultimately led to the classification. First, Thompson published what is regarded as the single most important paper in simple group theory—the  $N$ -group paper. In this magnum opus,

![](images/9417da50c97960c42bd1b2f308a3132dd8ae1e8a683a77d5534d17b76de510bc.jpg)  
Figure 24.1 W. Feit and J. G. Thompson, Solvability of Groups of Odd Order, Pacific Journal of Mathematics 13 (1963) 775-1029.

Thompson introduced many fundamental techniques and supplied a model for the classification of a broad family of simple groups. Second, Daniel Gorenstein produced an elaborate outline for the classification, which he delivered in a series of lectures at the University of Chicago in 1972. Here a program for the overall proof was laid out. The army of researchers now had a battle plan and a commander-in-chief. But this army still needed more and better weapons. Thus came the third critical development: the involvement of Michael Aschbacher. In a dazzling series of papers, Aschbacher combined his own insight with the methods of Thompson, which had been generalized throughout the 1960s, and a geometric approach pioneered by Bernd Fischer to achieve one brilliant result after another in rapid succession. In fact, so much progress was made by Aschbacher and others that by 1976, it was clear to nearly everyone involved that enough techniques had been developed to complete the classification. Only details remained.

The 1980s were ushered in with Aschbacher following in the footsteps of Feit and Thompson by winning the American Mathematical Society's Cole Prize in algebra (see the last section of this chapter).

A week later, Robert L. Griess made the spectacular announcement that he had constructed the "Monster."2 The Monster is the largest of the sporadic simple groups. It is very, very, very large. In fact, it has vastly more elements

than there are atoms on the earth! Its order is

808,017,424,794,512,875,886,459,904,961,710,757,005,754,368,000, 000,000

(hence, the name). This is approximately  $8 \times 10^{53}$  (roughly the size of the simple group  $A_{44}$ ). The Monster is a group of rotations in 196,883 dimensions. Thus, each element can be expressed as a  $196,883 \times 196,883$  matrix. Amazingly, 20 of the 26 sporadic groups (including itself) arise as factor groups of subgroups of the monster. Griess called them the "happy family." He called the other six "pariahs."

At the annual meeting of the American Mathematical Society in 1981, Gorenstein announced that the "Twenty-Five Years' War" to classify all the finite simple groups was over. Group theorists at long last had a list of all finite simple groups and a proof that the list was complete. The proof was spread out over hundreds of papers—both published and unpublished—and ran more than 10,000 pages in length. Because of the proof's extreme length and complexity, and the fact that some key parts of it had not been published, there was some concern in the mathematics community that the classification was not a certainty. By the end of the decade, group theorists had concluded that there was indeed a gap in the unpublished work that would be difficult to rectify. In the mid-1990s, Aschbacher and Stephen Smith began work on this problem. And, lo and behold, at the annual meeting of the American Mathematical Society in 2004, Aschbacher announced the coup de grêce that he and Smith had completed the classification. Their monograph is over 1200 pages in length. Ronald Solomon, writing in *Mathematical Reviews*, called it "an amazing tour de force" and a "major milestone in the history of finite group theory." Aschbacher concluded his remarks by saying that he would not bet his house that the proof is now error free.

Several people who played a central role in the classification are working on a "second generation" proof that will be much shorter and more comprehensible.

The Herculean undertaking by group theorists from the 1950s through the mid 2010s to discover and classify the finite simple groups has parallels in both chemistry and physics. The end result is analogous to the completion of the periodic table for chemical elements and the effort is reminiscent of the quest of physicists from the 1920s through the 1970s to develop quantum field theory. An image "periodic table" for finite simple groups is available at https://irandrus.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/periodic-table-of-groups.pdf

# Nonsimplicity Tests

In view of the fact that simple groups are the building blocks for all groups, it is surprising how scarce the non-Abelian simple groups are. For example,  $\mathrm{A}_5$  is the only one whose order is less than 168; there are only five non-Abelian simple groups of order less than 1000 and only 56 of order less than 1,000,000. In this section, we give a few theorems that are useful in proving that a particular integer is not the order of a non-Abelian simple group. Our first such result

is an easy arithmetic test that comes from combining Sylow's Third Theorem and the fact that groups of prime-power order have nontrivial centers.

# Theorem 24.1 Sylow Test for Nonsimplicity

Let  $n$  be a positive integer that is not prime, and let  $p$  be a prime divisor of  $n$ . If 1 is the only divisor of  $n$  that is equal to 1 modulo  $p$ , then there does not exist a simple group of order  $n$ .

PROOF If  $n$  is a prime-power, then a group of order  $n$  has a nontrivial center and, therefore, is not simple. If  $n$  is not a prime-power, then every Sylow subgroup is proper, and, by Sylow's Third Theorem, we know that the number of Sylow  $p$ -subgroups of a group of order  $n$  is equal to 1 modulo  $p$  and divides  $n$ . Since 1 is the only such number, the Sylow  $p$ -subgroup is unique, and therefore, by the corollary to Sylow's Third Theorem, it is normal.

How good is this test? Well, applying this criterion to all the nonprime integers between 1 and 200 would leave only the following integers as possible orders of finite non-Abelian simple groups: 12, 24, 30, 36, 48, 56, 60, 72, 80, 90, 96, 105, 108, 112, 120, 132, 144, 150, 160, 168, 180, and 192. (In fact, computer experiments have revealed that for large intervals, say, 500 or more, this test eliminates more than  $90\%$  of the nonprime integers as possible orders of simple groups.

Our next test rules out 30, 90, and 150.

# Theorem 24.2 2- Odd Test

An integer of the form  $2 \cdot n$ , where  $n$  is an odd number greater than 1, is not the order of a simple group.

PROOF Let  $G$  be a group of order  $2n$ , where  $n$  is odd and greater than 1. Recall from the proof of Cayley's Theorem (Theorem 6.5) that the mapping  $g \to T_g$  is an isomorphism from  $G$  to a permutation group on the elements of  $G$  [where  $T_g(x) = gx$  for all  $x$  in  $G$ ]. Since  $|G| = 2n$ , Cauchy's Theorem guarantees that there is an element  $g$  in  $G$  of order 2. Then, when the permutation  $T_g$  is written in disjoint cycle form, each cycle must have length 1 or 2; otherwise,  $|g| \neq 2$ . But  $T_g$  can contain no 1-cycles, because the 1-cycle  $(x)$  would mean  $x = T_g(x) = gx$ , so  $g = e$ . Thus, in cycle form,  $T_g$  consists of exactly  $n$  transpositions, where  $n$  is odd. Therefore,  $T_g$  is an odd permutation. This means that the set of even permutations in the image of  $G$  is a normal subgroup of index 2. (See Exercise 27 in Chapter 5 and Exercise 9 in Chapter 9.) Hence,  $G$  is not simple.

The next theorem is a broad generalization of Cayley's Theorem. We will make heavy use of its two corollaries.

# Theorem 24.3 Generalized Cayley Theorem

Let  $G$  be a group and let  $H$  be a subgroup of  $G$ . Let  $S$  be the group of all permutations of the left cosets of  $H$  in  $G$ . Then there is a homomorphism from  $G$  into  $S$  whose kernel lies in  $H$  and contains every normal subgroup of  $G$  that is contained in  $H$ .

PROOF For each  $g \in G$ , define a permutation  $T_g$  of the left cosets of  $H$  by  $T_g(xH) = gxH$ . As in the proof of Cayley's Theorem, it is easy to verify that the mapping of  $\alpha : g \to T_g$  is a homomorphism from  $G$  into  $S$ .

Now, if  $g \in \operatorname{Ker} \alpha$ , then  $T_g$  is the identity map, so  $H = T_g(H) = gH$  and, therefore,  $g$  belongs to  $H$ . Thus,  $\operatorname{Ker} \alpha \subseteq H$ . On the other hand, if  $K$  is normal in  $G$  and  $K \subseteq H$ , then for any  $k \subseteq K$  and any  $x$  in  $G$ , there is an element  $k'$  in  $K$  such that  $kx = xk'$ . Thus,

$$
T _ {k} (x H) = k x H = x k ^ {\prime} H = x H
$$

and, therefore,  $T_{k}$  is the identity permutation. This means that  $k \in \operatorname{Ker} \alpha$ . We have proved, then, that every normal subgroup of  $G$  contained in  $H$  is also contained in  $\operatorname{Ker} \alpha$ .

EXAMPLE 1 We illustrate the Generalized Cayley Theorem with  $D_4$  and the subgroup  $\mathcal{H} = \{R_0, H\}$ . Here  $S$  is the group of 24 permutations of the four cosets:  $\mathcal{H} = \{R_0, H\}$ ,  $R_{90}\mathcal{H} = \{R_{90}, D'\}$ ,  $R_{180}\mathcal{H} = \{R_{180}, V\}$ ,  $R_{270}\mathcal{H} = \{R_{270}, D\}$ .

In matrix form the images of  $R_{90}$  and  $\mathcal{H}$  are:

$$
T _ {R _ {9 0}} = \left[ \begin{array}{c c c c} \mathcal {H} & R _ {9 0} \mathcal {H} & R _ {1 8 0} \mathcal {H} & R _ {2 7 0} \mathcal {H} \\ R _ {9 0} \mathcal {H} & R _ {1 8 0} \mathcal {H} & R _ {2 7 0} \mathcal {H} & \mathcal {H} \end{array} \right] \text {a n d}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} T _ {H} = \left[ \begin{array}{c c c c} \mathcal {H} & R _ {9 0} \mathcal {H} & R _ {1 8 0} \mathcal {H} & R _ {2 7 0} \mathcal {H} \\ H \mathcal {H} & H R _ {9 0} \mathcal {H} & H R _ {1 8 0} \mathcal {H} & H R _ {2 7 0} \mathcal {H} \end{array} \right] \\ = \left[ \begin{array}{c c c c} \mathcal {H} & R _ {9 0} \mathcal {H} & R _ {1 8 0} \mathcal {H} & R _ {2 7 0} \mathcal {H} \\ \mathcal {H} & R _ {2 7 0} \mathcal {H} & R _ {1 8 0} \mathcal {H} & R _ {9 0} \mathcal {H} \end{array} \right]. \\ \end{array}
$$

In cycle form (we insert commas for clarity) the images of  $R_{90}$  and  $\mathcal{H}$  are:  $T_{R_{90}} = (\mathcal{H}, R_{90}\mathcal{H}, R_{180}\mathcal{H}, R_{270}\mathcal{H})$  and

$$
T _ {H} = (\mathcal {H}) (R _ {1 8 0} \mathcal {H}) (R _ {9 0} \mathcal {H}, R _ {2 7 0} \mathcal {H}) = (R _ {9 0} \mathcal {H}, R _ {2 7 0} \mathcal {H}).
$$

As a consequence of Theorem 24.3, we obtain the following very powerful arithmetic test for nonsimplicity.

# Corollary 1 Index Theorem

If  $G$  is a finite group and  $H$  is a proper subgroup of  $G$  such that  $|G|$  does not divide  $|G:H|!$ , then  $H$  contains a nontrivial normal subgroup of  $G$ . In particular,  $G$  is not simple.

PROOF Let  $\alpha$  be the homomorphism given in Theorem 24.3. Then  $\operatorname{Ker} \alpha$  is a normal subgroup of  $G$  contained in  $H$ , and  $G / \operatorname{Ker} \alpha$  is isomorphic to a subgroup of  $S$ . Thus,  $|G / \operatorname{Ker} \alpha| = |G| / |\operatorname{Ker} \alpha|$  divides  $|S| = |G:H|!$ . Since  $|G|$  does not divide  $|G:H|!$ , the order of  $\operatorname{Ker} \alpha$  must be greater than 1.

# Corollary 2 Embedding Theorem

If a finite non-Abelian simple group  $G$  has a subgroup of index  $n$ , then  $G$  is isomorphic to a subgroup of  $A_{n}$ .

PROOF Let  $H$  be the subgroup of index  $n$ , and let  $S_{n}$  be the group of all permutations of the  $n$  left cosets of  $H$  in  $G$ . By the Generalized Cayley Theorem, there is a nontrivial homomorphism from  $G$  into  $S_{n}$ . Since  $G$  is simple and the kernel of a homomorphism is a normal subgroup of  $G$ , we see that the mapping from  $G$  into  $S_{n}$  is one-to-one, so that  $G$  is isomorphic to some subgroup of  $S_{n}$ . Recall from Exercise 27 in Chapter 5 that any subgroup of  $S_{n}$  consists of even permutations only or half even and half odd. If  $G$  were isomorphic to a subgroup of the latter type, the even permutations would be a normal subgroup of index 2 (see Exercise 9 in Chapter 9), which would contradict the fact that  $G$  is simple. Thus,  $G$  is isomorphic to a subgroup of  $A_{n}$ .

The next corollary is a broad generalization of Exercise 9 in Chapter 9, which says that a subgroup of index 2 is a normal subgroup.

# Corollary Normal Subgroup Criterion

If  $G$  is a finite group and  $H$  is a subgroup of  $G$  with  $|G:H| = p$ , where  $p$  is the smallest prime that divides  $|G|$ , then  $H$  is a normal subgroup of  $G$ .

PROOF In the statement of Theorem 24.3, let  $K$  be the kernel of the homomorphism from  $G$  to  $S$  described there. Then  $K$  contains  $H$  and  $p = |G:H| = |G:K||K:H|$ . Because any element in  $G$  not in  $H$  is not in the kernel,  $|G:K| \neq 1$ , So,  $|K:H| = 1$ , and therefore  $H = K$ . Since every kernel is a normal subgroup,  $H$  is normal.

Using the Index Theorem with the largest Sylow subgroup for  $H$  reduces our list of possible orders of non-Abelian simple groups still further. For example, let  $G$  be any group of order  $80 = 16 \cdot 5$ . We may choose  $H$  to be a subgroup of order 16. Since 80 is not a divisor of 5!, there is no simple group of order 80. The same argument applies to 12, 24, 36, 48, 96, 108, 160, and 192, leaving only 56, 60, 72, 105, 112, 120, 132, 144, 168, and 180 as possible orders of non-Abelian simple groups up to 200. Let's consider these orders. Quite often we may use a counting argument to eliminate an integer. Consider 56. By Sylow's Third Theorem, we know that a simple group of order  $56 = 8 \cdot 7$  would contain eight Sylow 7-subgroups and seven Sylow 2-subgroups. Now, any two Sylow  $p$ -subgroups that have order  $p$  must intersect

in only the identity. So the union of the eight Sylow 7-subgroups yields 48 elements of order 7, and the union of any two Sylow 2-subgroups gives at least  $8 + 8 - 4 = 12$  new elements. But there are only 56 elements in all. This contradiction shows that there is not a simple group of order 56. An analogous argument also eliminates the integers 105 and 132.

So, our list of possible orders of non-Abelian simple groups up to 200 is down to 60, 72, 112, 120, 144, 168, and 180. Of these, 60 and 168 do correspond to simple groups. The others can be eliminated with a bit of razzle-dazzle.

The easiest case to handle is  $112 = 2^4 \cdot 7$ . Suppose there were a simple group  $G$  of order 112. A Sylow 2-subgroup of  $G$  must have index 7. So, by the Embedding Theorem,  $G$  is isomorphic to a subgroup of  $A_7$ . But 112 does not divide  $|A_7|$ , which is a contradiction.

Another easy case is 72. This case was done in Example 5 in Chapter 23 but we eliminate it using the Index Theorem. Recall from Exercise 9 in Chapter 23 that if we denote the number of Sylow  $p$ -subgroups of a group  $G$  by  $n_p$ , then  $n_p = |G : N(H)|$ , where  $H$  is any Sylow  $p$ -subgroup of  $G$ , and  $n_p \mod p = 1$ . It follows, then, that in a simple group of order 72, we have  $n_3 = 4$ , which is impossible, since 72 does not divide 4!

Next consider the possibility of a simple group  $G$  of order  $144 = 9 \cdot 16$ . By the Sylow theorems, we know that  $n_3 = 4$  or 16 and  $n_2 \geq 3$ . The Index Theorem rules out the case where  $n_3 = 4$ , so we know that there are 16 Sylow 3-subgroups. Now, if every pair of Sylow 3-subgroups had only the identity in common, a straightforward counting argument would produce more than 144 elements. So, let  $H$  and  $H'$  be a pair of Sylow 3-subgroups whose intersection has order 3. Then  $H \cap H'$  is a subgroup of both  $H$  and  $H'$  and, by the corollary to Theorem 23.2 (or by Exercise 45 in Chapter 23), we see that  $N(H \cap H')$  must contain both  $H$  and  $H'$  and, therefore, the set  $HH'$ . ( $HH'$  need not be a subgroup.) Thus,

$$
| N (H \cap H ^ {\prime}) | \geq | H H ^ {\prime} | = \frac {| H | | H ^ {\prime} |}{| H \cap H ^ {\prime} |} = \frac {9 \cdot 9}{3} = 2 7.
$$

Now, we have three arithmetic conditions on  $k = |N(H \cap H')|$ . We know that 9 divides  $k$ ;  $k$  divides 144; and  $k \geq 27$ . Clearly, then,  $k \geq 36$ , and so  $|G : N(H \cap H')| \leq 4$ . The Index Theorem now gives us the desired contradiction.

Finally, suppose that  $G$  is a non-Abelian simple group of order  $180 = 2^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5$ . Then  $n_5 = 6$  or 36 and  $n_3 = 10$  ( $n_3 = 4$  is ruled out by the Index Theorem). First, assume that  $n_5 = 36$ . Then  $G$  has  $36 \cdot 4 = 144$  elements of order 5. Now, if each pair of the Sylow 3-subgroups intersects in only the identity, then there are 80 more elements in the group, which is a contradiction. So, we may assume that there are two Sylow 3-subgroups  $L_3$  and  $L_3'$  whose intersection has order 3. Then, as was the case for order 144, we have

$$
\left| N \left(L _ {3} \cap L _ {3} ^ {\prime}\right) \right| \geq \left| L _ {3} L _ {3} ^ {\prime} \right| = \frac {9 \cdot 9}{3} = 2 7.
$$

Thus,  $|N(L_3 \cap L_3')| = 9 \cdot k$ , where  $k \geq 3$  and  $k$  divides 20. Clearly, then,  $|N(L_3 \cap L_3')| \geq 36$  and therefore  $|G : N(L_3 \cap L_3')| \leq 5$ .

The Index Theorem now gives us another contradiction. Hence, we may assume that  $n_5 = 6$ . In this case, we let  $H$  be the normalizer of a Sylow

5-subgroup of  $G$ . By Sylow's Third Theorem, we have  $6 = |G:H|$ , so that  $|H| = 30$ . In Chapter 23, we proved that every group of order 30 has an element of order 15. On the other hand, since  $n_5 = 6$ ,  $G$  has a subgroup of index 6 and the Embedding Theorem tells us that  $G$  is isomorphic to a subgroup of  $A_6$ . But  $A_6$  has no element of order 15. (See Exercise 23 in Chapter 5.)

We leave the case for 120 as an exercise (Exercise 17). Some hints are given in the answer section.

# The Simplicity of  $A_{5}$

Once 120 has been disposed of, we will have shown that the only integers between 1 and 200 that can be the orders of non-Abelian simple groups are 60 and 168. For completeness, we will now prove that  $A_{5}$ , which has order 60, is a simple group. A similar argument can be used to show that the factor group  $SL(2,Z_7) / Z(SL(2,Z_7))$  is a simple group of order 168. [This group is denoted by  $PSL(2,Z_7)$ .]

If  $A_{5}$  had a nontrivial proper normal subgroup  $H$ , then  $|H|$  would be equal to 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, or 30. By Exercise 65 in Chapter 5,  $A_{5}$  has 24 elements of order 5, 20 elements of order 3, and no elements of order 15. Now, if  $|H|$  is equal to 3, 6, 12, or 15, then  $|A_{5} / H|$  is relatively prime to 3, and by Exercise 61 in Chapter 9,  $H$  would have to contain all 20 elements of order 3. If  $|H|$  is equal to 5, 10, or 20, then  $|A_{5} / H|$  is relatively prime to 5, and therefore,  $H$  would have to contain the 24 elements of order 5. If  $|H| = 30$ , then  $|A_{5} / H|$  is relatively prime to both 3 and 5, and so  $H$  would have to contain all the elements of orders 3 and 5. Finally, if  $|H| = 2$  or  $|H| = 4$ , then  $|A_{5} / H| = 30$  or  $|A_{5} / H| = 15$ . But we know from our results in Chapter 23 that any group of order 30 or 15 has an element of order 15. However, since  $A_{5}$  contains no such element, neither does  $A_{5} / H$ . This proves that  $A_{5}$  is simple.

The simplicity of  $A_{5}$  was known to Galois in 1830, although the first formal proof was done by Jordan in 1870. A few years later, Felix Klein showed that the group of rotations of a regular icosahedron is simple and, therefore, isomorphic to  $A_{5}$  (see Exercise 27). Since then it has frequently been called the icosahedral group. Klein was the first to prove that there is a simple group of order 168.

The problem of determining which integers in a certain interval are possible orders for finite simple groups goes back to 1892, when Hölder went up to 200. His arguments for the integers 144 and 180 alone used up 10 pages. By 1975, this investigation had been pushed to well beyond 1,000,000. Of course, now that all finite simple groups have been classified, this problem is merely a historical curiosity.

Putting together that Cayley's Theorem tells us that every group is isomorphic to a subgroup of  $S_{n}$  for some  $n$ , and the fact that  $A_{n}$  is simple for all  $n \geq 5$ , we have from Exercise 73 in Chapter 6, which says  $S_{n}$  is a subgroup of  $A_{n + 2}$ , that every group is isomorphic to a subgroup of a finite simple group.

# The Fields Medal

Among the highest awards for mathematical achievement is the Fields Medal. Two to four such awards are bestowed at the opening session of the

International Congress of Mathematicians, held once every four years. Although the Fields Medal is considered by many mathematicians to be the equivalent of the Nobel Prize, there are great differences between these awards. Besides the huge disparity in publicity and monetary value associated with the two honors, the Fields Medal is restricted to those under 40 years of age.<sup>3</sup> This tradition stems from John Charles Fields's stipulation, in his will establishing the medal, that the awards should be "an encouragement for further achievement." This restriction precluded Andrew Wiles from winning the Fields Medal for his proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.

# The Cole Prize

Approximately every five years, beginning in 1928 (changed to every three years in 2003), the American Mathematical Society awards one or two Cole Prizes for research in algebra and one or two Cole Prizes for research in algebraic number theory. The prize was founded in honor of Frank Nelson Cole on the occasion of his retirement as secretary of the American Mathematical Society. In view of the fact that Cole was one of the first people interested in simple groups, it is interesting to note that no fewer than six recipients of the prize—Dickson, Chevalley, Brauer, Feit, Thompson, and Aschbacher—have

made fundamental contributions to simple group theory at some time in their careers. Recently the time between Cole Prizes was reduced to three years.

Fresh out of graduate school, he [Aschbacher] had just entered the field, and from that moment he became the driving force behind my program. In rapid succession he proved one astonishing theorem after another. Although there were many other major contributors to this final assault, Aschbacher alone was responsible for shrinking my projected 30-year timetable to a mere 10 years.

DANIEL GORENSTEIN, Scientific American

MICHAEL ASCHBACHER was born on April 8, 1944, in Little Rock, Arkansas. Shortly after his birth, his family moved to Illinois, where his father was a professor of accounting and his mother was a high school English teacher. When he was nine years old, his family moved to East Lansing, Michigan; six years later, they moved to Los Angeles.

After high school, Aschbacher enrolled at the California Institute of Technology. In addition to his schoolwork, he passed the first four actuary exams and was employed for a few years as an actuary, full-time in the summers and part-time during the academic year. Two of the Caltech mathematicians who influenced him were Marshall Hall and Donald Knuth. In his senior year, Aschbacher took abstract algebra but showed little interest in the course. Accordingly, he received a grade of C.

In 1966, Aschbacher went to the University of Wisconsin for a Ph.D. degree. He completed his dissertation in 1969, and, after spending one year as an assistant professor at the University of Illinois, he returned to Caltech and

quickly moved up to the rank of professor.

Aschbacher's dissertation work in the area of combinatorial geometries had led him to consider certain group theoretic questions. Gradually, he turned his attention more and more to purely group theoretic problems, particularly those bearing on the classification of finite simple groups. The 1980 Cole Prize Selection Committee said of one of his papers, "[It] lifted the subject to a new plateau and brought the classification within reach." Aschbacher has been elected to the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Sciences, and the vice presidency of the American Mathematical Society. In 2011, Aschbacher received the $75,000 Rolf Schock Prize from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for "his fundamental contributions to one of the largest mathematical projects ever, the classification of finite simple groups." In 2012, he shared the $100,000 Wolf Prize for his work in the theory of finite groups and shared the American Mathematical Society's Steele Prize for Exposition.

DANIEL GORENSTEIN was born in Boston on January 1, 1923. Upon graduating from Harvard in 1943 during World War II, Gorenstein was offered an instructorship at Harvard to teach mathematics to army personnel. After the war ended, he began graduate work at Harvard. He received his Ph.D. degree in 1951, working in algebraic geometry under Oscar Zariski. It was in his dissertation that he introduced the class of rings that is now named after him. In 1951, Gorenstein took a position at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts, where he stayed until moving to Northeastern University in 1964. From 1969 until his death on August 26, 1992, he was at Rutgers University.

In 1957, Gorenstein switched from algebraic geometry to finite groups, learning the basic material from I. N. Herstein while collaborating with him over the next few years. A milestone in Gorenstein's development as a group theorist came during 1960-1961, when

he was invited to participate in a "Group Theory Year" at the University of Chicago.

It was there that Gorenstein, assimilating the revolutionary techniques then being developed by John Thompson, began his fundamental work that contributed to the classification of finite simple groups.

Through his pioneering research papers, his dynamic lectures, his numerous personal contacts, and his influential book on finite groups, Gorenstein became the leader in the 25-year effort, by hundreds of mathematicians, that led to the classification of the finite simple groups.

Among the honors received by Gorenstein are the Steele Prize from the American Mathematical Society and election to membership in the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

JOHN G. THOMPSON was born on October 13, 1932, in Ottawa, Kansas. In 1951, he entered Yale University as a divinity student, but he switched to mathematics in his sophomore year. He a obtained a Ph.D. degree in 1959 at the University of Chicago. After one year on the faculty at Harvard, Thompson returned to Chicago. He remained there until 1968, when he moved to Cambridge University in England. In 1993, Thompson accepted an appointment at the University of Florida.

Thompson's brilliance was evident early. In his dissertation, he verified a 50-year-old conjecture about finite groups possessing a certain kind of automorphism. (An article about his achievement appeared in The New York Times.) The novel methods Thompson used in his dissertation foreshadowed the revolutionary ideas he would later introduce in the Feit-Thompson paper and the classification of minimal simple groups (simple groups that contain no proper

non-Abelian simple subgroups). The assimilation and extension of Thompson's methods by others throughout the 1960s and 1970s ultimately led to the classification of finite simple groups.

In the late 1970s, Thompson made significant contributions to coding theory, the theory of finite projective planes, and the theory of modular functions. His work on Galois groups is considered the most important in the field in the last half of the 20th century.

Among Thompson's many honors are the Cole Prize in algebra and the Fields Medal. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1967, the Royal Society of London in 1979, the Sylvester Medal in 1985, the Wolf Prize and the Poincaré Prize in 1992, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1998, the National Medal of Science in 2000, and the De Morgan Medal in 2013. In 2008, he was a cowinner of the $1,000,000 Abel Prize given by the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters.

# Generators and Relations

One cannot escape the feeling that these mathematical formulae have an independent existence and an intelligence of their own, that they are wiser than we are, wiser even than their discoverers, that we get more out of them than we originally put into them.

I presume that to the uninitiated the formulae will appear cold and cheerless.

# Motivation

In this chapter, we present a convenient way to define a group with certain prescribed properties. Simply put, we begin with a set of elements that we want to generate the group, and a set of equations (called relations) that specify the conditions that these generators are to satisfy. Among all such possible groups, we will select one that is as large as possible. This will uniquely determine the group up to isomorphism.

To provide motivation for the theory involved, we begin with a concrete example. Consider  $D_4$ , the group of symmetries of a square. Recall that  $R = R_{90}$  and  $H$ , a reflection across a horizontal axis, generate the group. Observe that  $R$  and  $H$  are related in the following ways:

$$
R ^ {4} = H ^ {2} = (R H) ^ {2} = R _ {0} \quad (\text {t h e i d e n t i t y}). \tag {25.1}
$$

Other relations between  $R$  and  $H$ , such as  $HR = R^3 H$  and  $RHR = H$ , also exist, but they can be derived from those given in Equation (1). For example,  $(RH)^2 = R_0$  yields  $HR = R^{-1}H^{-1}$ , and  $R^4 = H^2 = R_0$  yields  $R^{-1} = R^3$  and  $H^{-1} = H$ . So,  $HR = R^3 H$ . In fact, every relation between  $R$  and  $H$  can be derived from those given in Equation (1).

Thus,  $D_4$  is a group that is generated by a pair of elements  $a$  and  $b$  subject to the relations  $a^4 = b^2 = (ab)^2 = e$  and such that all other relations between  $a$  and  $b$  can be derived from these relations. This last stipulation is necessary because the subgroup  $\{R_0, R_{180}, H, V\}$  of  $D_4$  is generated by the two elements  $a = R_{180}$  and  $b = H$  that satisfy the relations  $a^4 = b^2 = (ab)^2 = e$ . However, the "extra" relation  $a^2 = e$  satisfied by this subgroup cannot be derived from the original ones (since  $R_{90}^2 \neq R_0$ ). It is natural to ask whether this description of  $D_4$  applies to some other group as well. The answer is no. Any other group generated by two elements  $\alpha$  and  $\beta$  satisfying only the

relations  $\alpha^4 = \beta^2 = (\alpha \beta)^2 = e$ , and those that can be derived from these relations, is isomorphic to  $D_4$ .

Similarly, one can show that the group  $Z_4 \oplus Z_2$  is generated by two elements  $a$  and  $b$  such that  $a^4 = b^2 = e$  and  $ab = ba$ , and any other relation between  $a$  and  $b$  can be derived from these relations. The purpose of this chapter is to show that this procedure can be reversed; that is, we can begin with any set of generators and relations among the generators and construct a group that is uniquely described by these generators and relations, subject to the stipulation that all other relations among the generators can be derived from the original ones.

# Definitions and Notation

We begin with some definitions and notation. For any set  $S = \{a, b, c, \ldots\}$  of distinct symbols, we create a new set  $S^{-1} = \{a^{-1}, b^{-1}, c^{-1}, \ldots\}$  by replacing each  $x$  in  $S$  by  $x^{-1}$ . Define the set  $W(S)$  to be the collection of all formal finite strings of the form  $x_{1}x_{2}\dots x_{k}$ , where each  $x_{i} \in S \cup S^{-1}$ . The elements of  $W(S)$  are called words from  $S$ . We also permit the string with no elements to be in  $W(S)$ . This word is called the empty word and is denoted by  $e$ .

We may define a binary operation on the set  $W(S)$  by juxtaposition; that is, if  $x_{1}x_{2}\dots x_{k}$  and  $y_{1}y_{2}\dots y_{t}$  belong to  $W(S)$ , then so does  $x_{1}x_{2}\dots x_{k}y_{1}y_{2}\dots y_{t}$ . Observe that this operation is associative and the empty word is the identity. Also, notice that a word such as  $aa^{-1}$  is not the identity, because we are treating the elements of  $W(S)$  as formal symbols with no implied meaning.

At this stage we have everything we need to make a group out of  $W(S)$  except inverses. Here a difficulty arises, since it seems reasonable that the inverse of the word  $ab$ , say, should be  $b^{-1}a^{-1}$ . But  $abb^{-1}a^{-1}$  is not the empty word! You may recall that we faced a similar obstacle long ago when we carried out the construction of the field of quotients of an integral domain. There we had formal symbols of the form  $a / b$  and we wanted the inverse of  $a / b$  to be  $b / a$ . But their product,  $ab / (ba)$ , was a formal symbol that was not the same as the formal symbol  $1 / 1$ , the identity. So, we proceed here as we did there—by way of equivalence classes.

# Definition Equivalence Classes of Words

For any pair of elements  $u$  and  $v$  of  $W(S)$ , we say that  $u$  is related to  $v$  if  $v$  can be obtained from  $u$  by a finite sequence of insertions or deletions of words of the form  $xx^{-1}$  or  $x^{-1}x$ , where  $x \in S$ .

We leave it as an exercise to show that this relation is an equivalence relation on  $W(S)$ . (See Exercise 1.)

EXAMPLE 1 Let  $S = \{a, b, c\}$ . Then  $acc^{-1}b$  is equivalent to  $ab; aab^{-1}bbaccc^{-1}$  is equivalent to  $aabac$ ; the word  $a^{-1}aabbb^{-1}a^{-1}$  is equivalent to the empty word; and the word  $ca^{-1}b$  is equivalent to  $cc^{-1}caa^{-1}a^{-1}bbca^{-1}ac^{-1}b^{-1}$ . Note, however, that  $cac^{-1}b$  is not equivalent to  $ab$ .

# Free Group

# Theorem 25.1 Equivalence Classes Form a Group

Let  $S$  be a set of distinct symbols. For any word  $u$  in  $W(S)$ , let  $\bar{u}$  denote the set of all words in  $W(S)$  equivalent to  $u$  (i.e.,  $\bar{u}$  is the equivalence class containing  $u$ ). Then the set of all equivalence classes of elements of  $W(S)$  is a group under the operation  $\bar{u} \cdot \bar{v} = \bar{u} v$ .

PROOF This proof is left to the reader.

The group defined in Theorem 25.1 is called a free group on  $S$ . Theorem 25.2 shows why free groups are important.

# Theorem 25.2 Universal Mapping Property

Every group is a homomorphic image of a free group.

PROOF Let  $G$  be a group and let  $S$  be a set of generators for  $G$ . (Such a set exists, because we may take  $S$  to be  $G$  itself.) Now let  $F$  be the free group on  $S$ . Unfortunately, since our notation for any word in  $W(S)$  also denotes an element of  $G$ , we have created a notational problem for ourselves. So, to distinguish between these two cases, we will denote the word  $x_{1}x_{2}\dots x_{n}$  in  $W(S)$  by  $(x_{1}x_{2}\dots x_{n})_{F}$  and the product  $x_{1}x_{2}\dots x_{n}$  in  $G$  by  $(x_{1}x_{2}\dots x_{n})_{G}$ . As before,  $\overline{x_1x_2\cdots x_n}$  denotes the equivalence class in  $F$  containing the word  $(x_{1}x_{2}\dots x_{n})_{F}$ . Notice that  $\overline{x_1x_2\cdots x_n}$  and  $(x_{1}x_{2}\dots x_{n})_{G}$  are entirely different elements, since the operations on  $F$  and  $G$  are different.

Now consider the mapping from  $F$  into  $G$  given by

$$
\phi \left(x _ {1} x _ {2} \dots x _ {n}\right) = \left(x _ {1} x _ {2} \dots x _ {n}\right) _ {G}.
$$

[All we are doing is taking a product in  $F$  and viewing it as a product in  $G$ . For example, if  $G$  is the cyclic group of order 4 generated by  $a$ , then  $\phi(aaaa) = (aaa)_{G} = a$ .] Clearly,  $\phi$  is well-defined, for inserting or deleting expressions of the form  $xx^{-1}$  or  $x^{-1}x$  in elements of  $W(S)$  corresponds to inserting or deleting the identity in  $G$ . To check that  $\phi$  is operation-preserving, observe that

$$
\begin{array}{l} \phi \left(x _ {1} x _ {2} \dots x _ {n}\right) \overline {{\left(y _ {1} y _ {2} \cdots y _ {m}\right)}} = \phi \left(x _ {1} x _ {2} \dots x _ {n} y _ {1} y _ {2} \dots y _ {m}\right) \\ = \left(x _ {1} x _ {2} \dots x _ {n} y _ {1} y _ {2} \dots y _ {m}\right) _ {G} \\ = \left(x _ {1} x _ {2} \dots x _ {n}\right) _ {G} \left(y _ {1} y _ {2} \dots y _ {m}\right) _ {G}. \\ \end{array}
$$

Finally,  $\phi$  is onto  $G$  because  $S$  generates  $G$ .

The following corollary is an immediate consequence of Theorem 25.2 and the First Isomorphism Theorem for Groups.

# Corollary Universal Factor Group Property

Every group is isomorphic to a factor group of a free group.

# Generators and Relations

We have now laid the foundation for defining a group by way of generators and relations. Before giving the definition, we will illustrate the basic idea with an example.

EXAMPLE 2 Let  $F$  be the free group on the set  $\{a, b\}$  and let  $N$  be the smallest normal subgroup of  $F$  containing the set  $\{a^4, b^2, (ab)^2\}$ . We will show that  $F / N$  is isomorphic to  $D_4$ . We begin by observing that the mapping  $\phi$  from  $F$  onto  $D_4$ , which takes  $a$  to  $R_{90}$  and  $b$  to  $H$  (horizontal reflection), defines a homomorphism whose kernel contains  $N$ . Thus,  $F / \mathrm{Ker} \phi$  is isomorphic to  $D_4$ . On the other hand, we claim that the set

$$
K = \{N, a N, a ^ {2} N, a ^ {3} N, b N, a b N, a ^ {2} b N, a ^ {3} b N \}
$$

of left cosets of  $N$  is  $F / N$  itself. To see this, notice that every member of  $F / N$  can be generated by starting with  $N$  and successively multiplying on the left by various combinations of  $a$ 's and  $b$ 's. So, it suffices to show that  $K$  is closed under multiplication on the left by  $a$  and  $b$ . It is trivial that  $K$  is closed under left multiplication by  $a$ . For  $b$ , we will do only one of the eight cases. The others can be done in a similar fashion. Consider  $b(aN)$ . Since  $b^2, abab, a^4 \in N$  and  $Nb = bN$ , we have  $baN = baNb^2 = babNb = a^{-1}(abab)Nb = a^{-1}Nb = a^{-1}a^4Nb = a^3Nb = a^3bN$ . Upon completion of the other cases (Exercise 3), we know that  $F / N$  has at most eight elements. At the same time, we know that  $F / \mathrm{Ker}\phi$  has exactly eight elements. Since  $F / \mathrm{Ker}\phi$  is a factor group of  $F / N$  [indeed,  $F / \mathrm{Ker}\phi \approx (F / N) / (\mathrm{Ker}\phi / N)$ ], it follows that  $F / N$  also has eight elements and  $F / N = F / \mathrm{Ker}\phi \approx D_4$ .

# Definitions Generators and Relations

Let  $G$  be a group generated by some subset  $A = \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\}$  and let  $F$  be the free group on  $A$ . Let  $W = \{w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_t\}$  be a subset of  $F$  and let  $N$  be the smallest normal subgroup of  $F$  containing  $W$ . We say that  $G$  is given by the generators  $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$  and the relations  $w_1 = w_2 = \dots = w_t = e$  if there is an isomorphism from  $F / N$  onto  $G$  that carries  $a_i N$  to  $a_i$ .

The notation for this situation is

$$
G = \left\langle a _ {1}, a _ {2}, \dots , a _ {n} \mid w _ {1} = w _ {2} = \dots = w _ {t} = e \right\rangle .
$$

As a matter of convenience, we have restricted the number of generators and relations in our definition to be finite. This restriction is not necessary, however. Also, it is often more convenient to write a relation in implicit

form. For example, the relation  $a^{-1}b^{-3}ab = e$  is often written as  $ab = b^3a$ . In practice, one does not bother writing down the normal subgroup  $N$  that contains the relations. Instead, one just manipulates the generators and treats anything in  $N$  as the identity, as our notation suggests. Rather than saying that  $G$  is given by

$$
\langle a _ {1}, a _ {2}, \dots , a _ {n} \mid w _ {1} = w _ {2} = \dots = w _ {t} = e \rangle ,
$$

many authors prefer to say that  $G$  has the presentation

$$
\langle a _ {1}, a _ {2}, \dots , a _ {n} \mid w _ {1} = w _ {2} = \dots = w _ {t} = e \rangle .
$$

Notice that a free group is "free" of relations; that is, the equivalence class containing the empty word is the only relation. We mention in passing the fact that a subgroup of a free group is also a free group. Free groups are of fundamental importance in a branch of algebra known as combinatorial group theory.

EXAMPLE 3 The discussion in Example 2 can now be summed up by writing

$$
D _ {4} = \langle a, b \mid a ^ {4} = b ^ {2} = (a b) ^ {2} = e \rangle .
$$

EXAMPLE 4 The group of integers is the free group on one letter; that is,  $Z \approx \langle a \rangle$ . This is the only nontrivial Abelian group that is free.

The next theorem formalizes the argument used in Example 2 to prove that the group defined there has eight elements.

# Theorem 25.3 Dyck's Theorem (1882)

Let

$$
G = \langle a _ {1}, a _ {2}, \dots , a _ {n} \mid w _ {1} = w _ {2} = \dots = w _ {t} = e \rangle
$$

and let

$$
\begin{array}{l} \bar {G} = \left\langle a _ {1}, a _ {2}, \dots , a _ {n} \mid w _ {1} = w _ {2} = \dots = w _ {t} = w _ {t + 1} = \dots = \right. \\ w _ {t + k} = e \rangle . \\ \end{array}
$$

Then  $\bar{G}$  is a homomorphic image of  $G$ .

# PROOF See Exercise 5.

In words, Theorem 25.3 says that if you start with generators and relations for a group  $G$  and create a group  $\bar{G}$  by imposing additional relations, then  $\bar{G}$  is a homomorphic image of  $G$ .

# Corollary Largest Group Satisfying Defining Relations

If  $K$  is a group satisfying the defining relations of a finite group  $G$  and  $|K| \geq |G|$ , then  $K$  is isomorphic to  $G$ .

# PROOF See Exercise 5.

EXAMPLE 5 Quaternions Consider the group  $G = \langle a, b \mid a^2 = b^2 = (ab)^2 \rangle$ . What does  $G$  look like? Formally, of course,  $G$  is isomorphic to  $F / N$ , where  $F$  is free on  $\{a, b\}$  and  $N$  is the smallest normal subgroup of  $F$  containing  $b^{-2}a^2$  and  $(ab)^{-2}a^2$ . Now, let  $H = \langle b \rangle$  and  $S = \{H, aH\}$ . Then, just as in Example 2, it follows that  $S$  is closed under multiplication by  $a$  and  $b$  from the left. So, as in Example 2, we have  $G = H \cup aH$ . Thus, we can determine the elements of  $G$  once we know exactly how many elements there are in  $H$ . (Here again, the three relations come in.) To do this, first observe that  $b^2 = (ab)^2 = abab$  implies  $b = aba$ . Then  $a^2 = b^2 = (aba)(aba) = aba^2ba = ab^4a$  and therefore  $b^4 = e$ . Hence,  $H$  has at most four elements, and therefore  $G$  has at most eight—namely,  $e, b, b^2, b^3, a, ab, ab^2$ , and  $ab^3$ . It is conceivable, however, that not all of these eight elements are distinct. For example,  $Z_2 \oplus Z_2$  satisfies the defining relations and has only four elements. Perhaps it is the largest group satisfying the relations. How can we show that the eight elements listed above are distinct? Well, consider the group  $\bar{G}$  generated by the matrices

$$
A = \left[ \begin{array}{c c} 0 & 1 \\ - 1 & 0 \end{array} \right] \quad \text {a n d} \quad B = \left[ \begin{array}{c c} 0 & i \\ i & 0 \end{array} \right],
$$

where  $i = \sqrt{-1}$ . Direct calculations show that in  $\bar{G}$ , the elements  $e, B, B^2, B^3, A, AB, AB^2$ , and  $AB^3$  are distinct and that  $\bar{G}$  satisfies the relations  $A^2 = B^2 = (AB)^2$ . So, it follows from the corollary to Dyck's Theorem that  $\bar{G}$  is isomorphic to  $G$  and therefore  $G$  has order 8.

The next example illustrates why, in Examples 2 and 5, it is necessary to show that the eight elements listed for the group are distinct.

# EXAMPLE 6 Let

$$
G = \langle a, b \mid a ^ {3} = b ^ {9} = e, a ^ {- 1} b a = b ^ {- 1} \rangle .
$$

Once again, we let  $H = \langle b \rangle$  and observe that  $G = H \cup aH \cup a^2H$ . Thus,

$$
G = \left\{a ^ {i} b ^ {j} \mid 0 \leq i \leq 2, 0 \leq j \leq 8 \right\},
$$

and therefore  $G$  has at most 27 elements. But this time we will not be able to find some concrete group of order 27 satisfying the same relations that  $G$  does, for notice that  $b^{-1} = a^{-1}ba$  implies

$$
b = (a ^ {- 1} b a) ^ {- 1} = a ^ {- 1} b ^ {- 1} a.
$$

Hence,

$$
\begin{array}{l} b = e b e = a ^ {- 3} b a ^ {3} = a ^ {- 2} (a ^ {- 1} b a) a ^ {2} = a ^ {- 2} b ^ {- 1} a ^ {2} \\ = a ^ {- 1} (a ^ {- 1} b ^ {- 1} a) a = a ^ {- 1} b a = b ^ {- 1}. \\ \end{array}
$$

So, the original three relations imply the additional relation  $b^{2} = e$ . But  $b^{2} = e = b^{9}$  further implies  $b = e$ . It follows, then, that  $G$  has at most three distinct elements—namely,  $e, a$ , and  $a^{2}$ . But  $Z_{3}$  satisfies the defining relations with  $a = 1$  and  $b = 0$ . So,  $|G| = 3$ .

We hope Example 6 convinces you of the fact that, once a list of the elements of the group given by a set of generators and relations has been obtained, one must further verify that this list has no duplications. Typically, this is accomplished by exhibiting a specific group that satisfies the given set of generators and relations and that has the same size as the list. Obviously, experience plays a role here.

Here is a fun example adapted from [1].

EXAMPLE 7 Let  $G$  be the group with the 26 letters of the alphabet as generators. For relations we take strings  $A = B$ , where  $A$  and  $B$  are words in some fixed reference, say [2], and have the same pronunciation but different meanings (such words are called homophones). For example,  $buy = by = bye$ , hour = our, lead = led, whole = hole. From these strings and cancellation, we obtain  $u = e = h = a = w = \theta$  ( $\theta$  is the identity string). With these examples in mind, we ask, What is the group given by these generators and relations? Surprisingly, the answer is the infinite cyclic group generated by  $v$ . To verify this, one must show that every letter except  $v$  is equivalent to  $\theta$  and that there are no two homophones that contain a different number of  $v$ 's. The former can easily be done with common words. For example, from  $inn = in, plumb = plum$ , and  $knot = not$ , we see that  $n = b = k = \theta$ . From too = to we have  $o = \theta$ . That there are no two homophones in [2] that have a different number of  $v$ 's can be verified by simply checking all cases. In contrast, the reference Handbook of Homophones by W. C. Townsend lists felt/verdt as homophones. Of course, including these makes the group trivial.

# Classification of Groups of Order Up to 15

The next theorem illustrates the utility of the ideas presented in this chapter.

# Theorem 25.4 Classification of Groups of Order 8 (Cayley, 1859)

Up to isomorphism, there are only five groups of order 8:  $Z_8, Z_4 \oplus Z_2, Z_2 \oplus Z_2 \oplus Z_2, D_4$ , and the quaternions.

PROOF The Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups takes care of the Abelian cases. Now, let  $G$  be a non-Abelian group of order 8. Also, let

$G_{1} = \langle a,b\mid a^{4} = b^{2} = (ab)^{2} = e\rangle$  and let  $G_{2} = \langle a,b\mid a^{2} = b^{2} = (ab)^{2}\rangle$ . We know from the preceding examples that  $G_{1}$  is isomorphic to  $D_{4}$  and  $G_{2}$  is isomorphic to the quaternions. Thus, it suffices to show that  $G$  must satisfy the defining relations for  $G_{1}$  or  $G_{2}$ . It follows from Exercise 45 in Chapter 2 and Lagrange's Theorem that  $G$  has an element of order 4; call it  $a$ . Then, if  $b$  is any element of  $G$  not in  $\langle a\rangle$ , we know that

$$
G = \langle a \rangle \cup \langle a \rangle b = \{e, a, a ^ {2}, a ^ {3}, b, a b, a ^ {2} b, a ^ {3} b \}.
$$

Consider the element  $b^2$  of  $G$ . Which of the eight elements of  $G$  can it be? Not  $b, ab, a^2b$ , or  $a^3b$ , by cancellation. Not  $a$ , for  $b^2$  commutes with  $b$  and  $a$  does not. Not  $a^3$ , for the same reason. Thus,  $b^2 = e$  or  $b^2 = a^2$ . Suppose  $b^2 = e$ . Since  $\langle a \rangle$  is a normal subgroup of  $G$ , we know that  $bab^{-1} \in \langle a \rangle$ . From this and the fact that  $|bab^{-1}| = |a|$ , we then conclude that  $bab^{-1} = a$  or  $bab^{-1} = a^{-1}$ . The first relation would mean that  $G$  is Abelian, so we know that  $bab^{-1} = a^{-1}$ . But then, since  $b^2 = e$ , we have  $(ab)^2 = e$ , and therefore  $G$  satisfies the defining relations for  $G_1$ .

Finally, if  $b^2 = a^2$  holds instead of  $b^2 = e$ , we can use  $bab^{-1} = a^{-1}$  to conclude that  $(ab)^2 = a(bab^{-1})b^2 = aa^{-1}b^2 = b^2$ , and therefore  $G$  satisfies the defining relations for  $G_2$ .

The classification of the groups of order 8, together with our results on groups of order  $p^2$ ,  $2p$ , and  $pq$  from Chapter 23, allows us to classify the groups of order up to 15, with the exception of those of order 12. We already know four groups of order 12—namely,  $Z_{12}, Z_6 \oplus Z_2, D_6$ , and  $A_4$ . An argument along the lines of Theorem 25.4 can be given to show that there is only one more group of order 12. This group, called the dicyclic group of order 12 and denoted by  $Q_6$ , has presentation  $\langle a, b \mid a^6 = e, a^3 = b^2, b^{-1}ab = a^{-1} \rangle$ . Table 25.1 lists the groups of order at most 15. We use  $Q_4$  to denote the quaternions (see Example 5 in this chapter).

# Characterization of Dihedral Groups

As another nice application of generators and relations, we will now give a characterization of the dihedral groups that has been known for more than 100 years. For  $n \geq 3$ , we have used  $D_{n}$  to denote the group of symmetries of a regular  $n$ -gon. Imitating Example 2, one can show that  $D_{n} \approx \langle a, b \mid a^{n} = b^{2} = (ab)^{2} = e \rangle$  (see Exercise 9). By analogy, these generators and relations serve to define  $D_{1}$  and  $D_{2}$  also. (These are also called dihedral groups.) Finally, we define the infinite dihedral group  $D_{\infty}$  as  $\langle a, b \mid a^{2} = b^{2} = e \rangle$ . The elements of  $D_{\infty}$  can be listed as  $e, a, b, ab, ba, (ab)a, (ba)b, (ab)^{2}, (ba)^{2}a, (ba)^{2}b, (ab)^{3}, (ba)^{3}, \ldots$ .

# Theorem 25.5 Characterization of Dihedral Groups

# Any group generated by a pair of elements of order 2 is dihedral.

PROOF Let  $G$  be a group generated by a pair of distinct elements of order 2, say,  $a$  and  $b$ . We consider the order of  $ab$ . If  $|ab| = \infty$ , then  $G$  is infinite and

satisfies the relations of  $D_{\infty}$ . We will show that  $G$  is isomorphic to  $D_{\infty}$ . By Dyck's Theorem,  $G$  is isomorphic to some factor group of  $D_{\infty}$ , say,  $D_{\infty} / H$ . Now, suppose  $h \in H$  and  $h \neq e$ . Since every element of  $D_{\infty}$  has one of the forms  $(ab)^i, (ba)^i, (ab)^ia$ , or  $(ba)^ib$ , by symmetry, we may assume that  $h = (ab)^i$  or  $h = (ab)^ia$ . If  $h = (ab)^i$ , we will show that  $D_{\infty} / H$  satisfies the relations for  $D_i$  given in Exercise 9. Since  $(ab)^i$  is in  $H$ , we have

$$
H = (a b) ^ {i} H = (a b H) ^ {i},
$$

so that  $(abH)^{-1} = (abH)^{i - 1}$ . But

$$
(a b) ^ {- 1} H = b ^ {- 1} a ^ {- 1} H = b a H,
$$

and it follows that

$$
a H a b H a H = a ^ {2} H b H a H = e H b a H = b a H = (a b H) ^ {- 1}.
$$

Thus,

$$
D _ {\infty} / H = \langle a H, b H \rangle = \langle a H, a b H \rangle
$$

(see Exercise 7), and  $D_{\infty} / H$  satisfies the defining relations for  $D_{i}$  (use Exercise 9 with  $x = aH$  and  $y = abH$ ). In particular,  $G$  is finite—an impossibility.

If  $h = (ab)^i a$ , then

$$
H = (a b) ^ {i} a H = (a b) ^ {i} H a H,
$$

and therefore

$$
(a b H) ^ {i} = (a b) ^ {i} H = (a H) ^ {- 1} = a ^ {- 1} H = a H.
$$

It follows that

$$
\langle a H, b H \rangle = \langle a H, a b H \rangle \subseteq \langle a b H \rangle .
$$

However,

$$
\left(a b H\right) ^ {2 i} = \left(a H\right) ^ {2} = a ^ {2} H = H,

so that  $D_{\infty} / H$  is again finite. This contradiction forces  $H = \{e\}$  and  $G$  to be isomorphic to  $D_{\infty}$ .

Finally, suppose that  $|ab| = n$ . Since  $G = \langle a,b\rangle = \langle a,ab\rangle$ , we can show that  $G$  is isomorphic to  $D_{n}$  by proving that  $b(ab)b = (ab)^{-1}$ , which is the same as  $ba = (ab)^{-1}$ . But  $(ab)^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1} = ba$ , since  $a$  and  $b$  have order 2.

We conclude this chapter by commenting on the advantages and disadvantages of using generators and relations to define groups. The principal advantage is that in many situations—particularly in knot theory, algebraic topology, and geometry—groups defined by way of generators and relations arise in a natural way. Within group theory itself, it is often convenient to construct examples and counterexamples with generators and relations. Among the disadvantages of defining a group by generators and relations is the fact that it is often difficult to decide whether or not the group is finite, or even whether or not a particular element is the identity. Furthermore, the same group can be defined with entirely different sets of generators and relations, and, given two groups defined by generators and relations, it is often extremely difficult to decide whether or not these two groups are isomorphic. Nowadays, these questions are frequently tackled with the aid of a computer.

MARSHALL HALL, JR., was born on September 17, 1910, in St. Louis, Missouri. He demonstrated interest in mathematics at the age of 11 when he constructed a seven-place table of logarithms for the positive integers up to 1000. He completed a B.A. degree in 1932 at Yale. After spending a year at Cambridge University, where he worked with Philip Hall, Harold Davenport, and G. H. Hardy, he returned to Yale for his Ph.D. degree. At the outbreak of World War II, he joined Naval Intelligence and had significant success in deciphering both the Japanese codes and the German Enigma messages.

# Isometries

In the early chapters of this book, we briefly discussed symmetry groups. In this chapter and the next, we examine this fundamentally important concept in some detail. It is convenient to begin such a discussion with the definition of an isometry (from the Greek isometros, meaning "equal measure") in  $\mathbf{R}^n$ .

# Definition Isometry

An isometry of  $n$ -dimensional space  $\mathbf{R}^n$  is a function from  $\mathbf{R}^n$  onto  $\mathbf{R}^n$  that preserves distance.

In other words, a function  $T$  from  $\mathbf{R}^n$  onto  $\mathbf{R}^n$  is an isometry if, for every pair of points  $p$  and  $q$  in  $\mathbf{R}^n$ , the distance from  $T(p)$  to  $T(q)$  is the same as the distance from  $p$  to  $q$ . With this definition, we may now make precise the definition of the symmetry group of an  $n$ -dimensional figure.

# Definition Symmetry Group of a Figure in  $\mathbf{R}^n$

Let  $F$  be a set of points in  $\mathbf{R}^n$ . The symmetry group of  $F$  in  $\mathbf{R}^n$  is the set of all isometries of  $\mathbf{R}^n$  that carry  $F$  onto itself. The group operation is function composition.

It is important to realize that the symmetry group of an object depends not only on the object, but also on the space in which we view it. For example, the symmetry group of a line segment in  $\mathbf{R}^1$  has order 2, the symmetry group of a line segment considered as a set of points in  $\mathbf{R}^2$  has order 4, and the symmetry group of a line segment viewed as a set of points in  $\mathbf{R}^3$  has infinite order (see Exercise 9).

Although we have formulated our definitions for all finite dimensions, our chief interest will be the two-dimensional case. It has been known since 1831

that every isometry of  $\mathbf{R}^2$  is one of four types: rotation, reflection, translation, and glide-reflection. Rotation about a point in a plane needs no explanation. A reflection across a line  $L$  is that transformation that leaves every point of  $L$  fixed and takes every point  $Q$ , not on  $L$ , to the point  $Q'$  so that  $L$  is the perpendicular bisector of the line segment from  $Q$  to  $Q'$  (see Figure 26.1). The line  $L$  is called the axis of reflection. In an  $xy$ -coordinate plane, the transformation  $(x,y) \to (x,-y)$  is a reflection across the  $x$ -axis, whereas  $(x,y) \to (y,x)$  is a reflection across the line  $y = x$ . Some authors call an axis of reflective symmetry  $L$  a mirror because  $L$  acts like a two-sided mirror; that is, the image of a point  $Q$  in a mirror placed on the line  $L$  is, in fact, the image of  $Q$  under the reflection across the line  $L$ . Reflections are called opposite isometries because they reverse orientation. For example, the reflected image of a clockwise spiral is a counterclockwise spiral. Similarly, the reflected image of a right hand is a left hand. (See Figure 26.1.)

Figure 26.1 Reflected images.

A translation is simply a function that carries all points the same distance in the same direction. For example, if  $p$  and  $q$  are points in a plane and  $T$  is a translation, then the two directed line segments joining  $p$  to  $T(p)$  and  $q$  to  $T(q)$  have the same length and direction. A glide-reflection is the product of a translation and a reflection across the line containing the translation line segment. This line is called the glide-axis. In Figure 26.2, the arrow gives the direction and length of the translation, and is contained in the axis of reflection. A glide-reflection is also an opposite isometry. Successive footprints in wet sand are related by a glide-reflection.

# Classification of Finite Plane Symmetry Groups

Our first goal in this chapter is to classify all finite plane symmetry groups. As we have seen in earlier chapters, the dihedral group  $D_{n}$  is the plane symmetry group of a regular  $n$ -gon. (For convenience, call  $D_{2}$  the plane symmetry group of a nonsquare rectangle and  $D_{1}$  the plane symmetry group of the letter "V." In particular,  $D_{2} \approx Z_{2} \oplus Z_{2}$  and  $D_{1} \approx Z_{2}$ .) The cyclic groups  $Z_{n}$  are easily seen to be plane symmetry groups also. Figure 26.3 is an illustration

of an organism whose plane symmetry group consists of four rotations and is isomorphic to  $Z_{4}$ . The surprising fact is that the cyclic groups and dihedral groups are the only finite plane symmetry groups. The famous mathematician Hermann Weyl attributes the following theorem to Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519).

# Theorem 26.1 Finite Symmetry Groups in the Plane

# The only finite plane symmetry groups are  $Z_{n}$  and  $D_{n}$ .

PROOF Let  $G$  be a finite plane symmetry group of some figure. We first observe that  $G$  cannot contain a translation or a glide-reflection, because in either case  $G$  would be infinite. Now observing that the composition of two reflections preserves orientation, we know that such a composition is a translation or rotation. When the two reflections have parallel axes of reflection, there is no fixed point so the composition is a translation. Thus, every two reflections in  $G$  have reflection axes that intersect in some point. We claim that all the axes of reflections intersect in the same point. Suppose that  $f$  and  $f'$  are two distinct reflections in  $G$ . Then because  $ff'$  preserves orientation, we know that  $ff'$  is a rotation. We use the fact from geometry that a finite group of rotations must have a common center, say  $P$ . This means that the axes of any two reflections must intersect at point  $P$ . So, we have shown that all the elements of  $G$  have the common fixed point  $P$ .

For convenience, let us denote a rotation about  $P$  of  $\sigma$  degrees by  $R_{\sigma}$ . Now, among all rotations in  $G$ , let  $\beta$  be the smallest positive angle of rotation. (Such an angle exists, since  $G$  is finite and  $R_{360}$  belongs to  $G$ .) We claim that every rotation in  $G$  is some power of  $R_{\beta}$ . To see this, suppose that  $R_{\sigma}$  is in  $G$ . We may assume  $0^{\circ} < \sigma \leq 360^{\circ}$ . Then,  $\beta \leq \sigma$  and there is

some integer  $t$  such that  $t\beta \leq \sigma < (t + 1)\beta$ . But, then  $R_{\sigma - t\beta} = R_{\sigma}(R_{\beta})^{-t}$  is in  $G$  and  $0 \leq \sigma - t\beta < \beta$ . Since  $\beta$  represents the smallest positive angle of rotation among the elements of  $G$ , we must have  $\sigma - t\beta = 0$ , and therefore,  $R_{\sigma} = (R_{\beta})^{t}$ . This verifies the claim.

For convenience, let us say that  $|R_{\beta}| = n$ . Now, if  $G$  has no reflections, we have proved that  $G = \langle R_{\beta} \rangle \approx Z_{n}$ . If  $G$  has at least one reflection, say  $f$ , then

$$
f, f R _ {\beta}, f (R _ {\beta}) ^ {2}, \dots , f (R _ {\beta}) ^ {n - 1}
$$

are also reflections. Furthermore, this is the entire set of reflections of  $G$ . For if  $g$  is any reflection in  $G$ , then  $fg$  is a rotation, and so  $fg = (R_{\beta})^k$  for some  $k$ . Thus,  $g = f^{-1}(R_{\beta})^k = f(R_{\beta})^k$ . So

$$
G = \left\{R _ {0}, R _ {\beta}, (R _ {\beta}) ^ {2}, \dots , (R _ {\beta}) ^ {n - 1}, f, f R _ {\beta}, f (R _ {\beta}) ^ {2}, \dots , f (R _ {\beta}) ^ {n - 1} \right\},
$$

and  $G$  is generated by the pair of reflections  $f$  and  $fR_{\beta}$ . Hence, by our characterization of the dihedral groups (Theorem 25.5),  $G$  is the dihedral group  $D_{n}$ .

# Classification of Finite Groups of Rotations in  $\mathbb{R}^3$

One might think that the set of all possible finite symmetry groups in three dimensions would be much more diverse than is the case for two dimensions. Surprisingly, this is not the case. For example, moving to three dimensions introduces only three new groups of rotations. This observation was first made by the physicist and mineralogist Auguste Bravais in 1849, in his study of possible structures of crystals.

# Theorem 26.2 Finite Groups of Rotations in  $\mathbf{R}^3$

Up to isomorphism, the finite groups of rotations in  $R^3$  are  $Z_n, D_n, A_4, S_4$ , and  $A_5$ .

Theorem 26.2, together with the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem (Theorem 7.4), makes easy work of determining the group of rotations of an object in  $\mathbf{R}^3$ .

EXAMPLE 1 We determine the group  $G$  of rotations of the cuboctahedron in Figure 26.4, which is composed of six congruent squares and eight congruent equilateral triangles. We begin by singling out any one of the squares. Obviously, there are four rotations that map this square to itself, and the designated square can be rotated to the location of any of the other five. So, by the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem (Theorem 7.4), the rotation group has order  $4 \cdot 6 = 24$ . By Theorem 26.2,  $G$  is one of  $Z_{24}$ ,  $D_{12}$ , and  $S_4$ . But each of the first two groups has exactly two elements of order 4, whereas  $G$  has more than two. So,  $G$  is isomorphic to  $S_4$ .

The group of rotations of a tetrahedron (the tetrahedral group) is isomorphic to  $A_4$ ; the group of rotations of a cube or an octahedron (the octahedral

group) is isomorphic to  $S_4$ ; the group of rotations of a dodecahedron or an icosahedron (the icosahedral group) is isomorphic to  $A_5$ . These five solids are illustrated in Figure 26.5.

# Symmetry and Counting

Let us pause to slake our thirst one last time at symmetry's bubbling spring.

Timothy Ferris, Coming of Age in the Milky Way

Whenever you can, count.

Francis Galton, (1822-1911)

# Motivation

Permutation groups naturally arise in many situations involving symmetric designs or arrangements. Consider, for example, the task of coloring the six vertices of a regular hexagon so that three are black and three are white. Figure 27.1 shows the  $\binom{6}{3}=20$  possibilities. However, if these designs appeared on one side of hexagonal ceramic tiles, it would be nonsensical to count the designs shown in Figure 27.1(a) as different, since all six designs shown there can be obtained from one of them by rotating. (A manufacturer would make only one of the six.) In this case, we say that the designs in Figure 27.1(a) are equivalent under the group of rotations of the hexagon. Similarly, the designs in Figure 27.1(b) are equivalent under the group of rotations, as are the designs in Figure 27.1(c) and those in Figure 27.1(d). And, since no design from Figure 27.1(a)-(d) can be obtained from a design in a different part by rotation, we see that the designs within each part of the figure are equivalent to each other but nonequivalent to any design in another part of the figure. However, the designs in Figure 27.1(b) and (c) are equivalent under the dihedral group  $D_{6}$ , since the designs in Figure 27.1(b) can be reflected to yield the designs in Figure 27.1(c). For example, for purposes of arranging three black beads and three white beads to form a necklace, the designs shown in Figure 27.1(b) and (c) would be considered equivalent.

In general, we say that two designs (arrangements of beads)  $A$  and  $B$  are equivalent under a group  $G$  of permutations of the arrangements if there is an element  $\phi$  in  $G$  such that  $\phi(A) = B$ . That is, two designs are equivalent under  $G$  if they are in the same orbit of  $G$ . It follows, then, that the number of nonequivalent designs under  $G$  is simply the number of orbits of designs under  $G$ . (The set being permuted is the set of all possible designs or arrangements.)

Notice that the designs in Figure 27.1 divide into four orbits under the group of rotations but only three orbits under the group  $D_{6}$ , since the designs in Figure 27.1(b) and (c) form a single orbit under  $D_{6}$ . Thus, we could obtain all 20 tile designs from just four tiles, but we could obtain all 20 necklaces from just three of them.

# Burnside's Theorem

Although the problems we have just posed are simple enough to solve by observation, more complicated ones require a more sophisticated approach. Such an approach was provided by Georg Frobenius in 1887. Frobenius's theorem did not become widely known until it appeared in the classic book on group theory by William Burnside in 1911. By an accident of history, Frobenius's theorem has come to be known as Burnside's Theorem. Before stating this theorem, we recall some notation introduced in Chapter 7 and introduce new notation. If  $G$  is a group of permutations on a set  $S$  and  $i \in S$ , then  $\operatorname{stab}_G(i) = \{\phi \in G \mid \phi(i) = i\}$  and  $\operatorname{orb}_G(i) = \{\phi(i) \mid \phi \in G\}$ . For any set  $X$ , we use  $|X|$  to denote the number of elements in  $X$ .

# Definition Elements Fixed by  $\phi$

For any group  $G$  of permutations on a set  $S$  and any  $\phi$  in  $G$ , we let  $\mathrm{fix}(\phi) = \{i \in S \mid \phi(i) = i\}$ . This set is called the elements fixed by  $\phi$  (or more simply, "fix of  $\phi$ ").

# Theorem 27.1 Burnside's Theorem

If  $G$  is a finite group of permutations on a set  $S$ , then the number of orbits of elements of  $S$  under  $G$  is

$$
\frac {1}{| G |} \sum_ {\phi \in G} | \operatorname {f i x} (\phi) |.
$$

PROOF Let  $n$  denote the number of pairs  $(\phi, i)$ , with  $\phi \in G, i \in S$ , and  $\phi(i) = i$ . We begin by counting these pairs in two ways. First, for each particular  $\phi$  in  $G$ , the number of such pairs is exactly  $|\operatorname{fix}(\phi)|$ . So,

$$
n = \sum_ {\phi \in G} | \operatorname {f i x} (\phi) |.
$$

Second, for each particular  $i$  in  $S$ , observe that  $\left|\operatorname{stab}_G(i)\right|$  is exactly the number of pairs  $(\phi, i)$  for which  $\phi(i) = i$ . So,

$$
n = \sum_ {i \in S} | \operatorname {s t a b} _ {G} (i) |.
$$

It follows from Exercise 67 in Chapter 7 that if  $s$  and  $t$  are in the same orbit of  $G$ , then  $\mathrm{orb}_G(s) = \mathrm{orb}_G(t)$ , and thus by the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem (Theorem 7.4) we have  $|\mathrm{stab}_G(s)| = |G| / |\mathrm{orb}_G(s)| = |G| / |\mathrm{orb}_G(t)| = |\mathrm{stab}_G(t)|$ . So, if we choose  $s \in S$  and sum over  $\mathrm{orb}_G(s)$ , we have

$$
\sum_ {t \in \operatorname {o r b} _ {G} (s)} | \operatorname {s t a b} _ {G} (t) | = | \operatorname {o r b} _ {G} (S) | | \operatorname {s t a b} _ {G} (S) | = | G |.
$$

Finally, by summing over all the elements of  $G$ , one orbit at a time, it follows from Equations (1), (2), and (3) that

$$
\sum_ {\phi \in G} | \operatorname {f i x} (\phi) | = \sum_ {i \in S} | \operatorname {s t a b} (i) | = | G | \cdot (\text {n u m b e r o f o r b i t s})
$$

and the result follows.

# Applications

To illustrate how to apply Burnside's Theorem, let us return to the ceramic tile and necklace problems. In the case of counting hexagonal tiles with three black vertices and three white vertices, the objects being permuted are the 20 possible designs, whereas the group of permutations is the group of six rotational symmetries of a hexagon. Obviously, the identity fixes all 20 designs. We see from Figure 27.1 that rotations of  $60^{\circ}$ ,  $180^{\circ}$ , or  $300^{\circ}$  fix none of the 20 designs. Finally, Figure 27.2 shows  $\mathrm{fix}(\phi)$  for the rotations of  $120^{\circ}$  and  $240^{\circ}$ . These data are collected in Table 27.1.

![](images/d0d9a694f1d60c98e5d3f46221d5c549741eb677393633a34ef5e7a5e3da04f9.jpg)  
Figure 27.2 Tile designs fixed by  $120^{\circ}$  rotation and  $240^{\circ}$  rotation.

So, applying Burnside's Theorem, we obtain the number of orbits under the group of rotations as

$$
\frac {1}{6} (2 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 0) = 4.
$$

Table 27.1  

<table><tr><td>Element</td><td>Number of Designs Fixed by Element</td></tr><tr><td>Identity</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Rotation of 60°</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Rotation of 120°</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Rotation of 180°</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Rotation of 240°</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Rotation of 300°</td><td>0</td></tr></table>

Now let's use Burnside's Theorem to count the number of necklace arrangements consisting of three black beads and three white beads. (For the purposes of analysis, we may arrange the beads in the shape of a regular hexagon.) For this problem, two arrangements are equivalent if they are in the same orbit under  $D_{6}$ . Figure 27.3 shows the arrangements fixed by a reflection across a diagonal. Table 27.2 summarizes the information needed to apply Burnside's Theorem.

![](images/e317dc32a62f781760de7a404129ceed292b2edb0e27315c0f0822847bba2bd3.jpg)  
Figure 27.3 Bead arrangements fixed by the reflection across a diagonal.

Table 27.2  

<table><tr><td>Type of Element</td><td>Number of Elements of This Type</td><td>Number of Arrangements Fixed by Type of Element</td></tr><tr><td>Identity</td><td>1</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Rotation of order 2 (180°)</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Rotation of order 3 (120° or 240°)</td><td>2</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Rotation of order 6 (60° or 300°)</td><td>2</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Reflection across diagonal</td><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>Reflection across side bisector</td><td>3</td><td>0</td></tr></table>

So, there are

$$
\frac {1}{1 2} (1 \cdot 2 0 + 1 \cdot 0 + 2 \cdot 2 + 2 \cdot 0 + 3 \cdot 4 + 3 \cdot 0) = 3
$$

nonequivalent ways to string three black beads and three white beads on a necklace.

Now that we have gotten our feet wet on a few easy problems, let's try a more difficult one. Suppose that we have the colors red (R), white (W), and blue (B) that can be used to color the edges of a regular tetrahedron (see Figure 5.1). First, observe that there are  $3^{6} = 729$  colorings without regard to equivalence. How shall we decide when two colorings of the tetrahedron are nonequivalent? Certainly, if we were to pick up a tetrahedron colored in a certain manner, rotate it, and put it back down, we would think of the tetrahedron as being positioned differently rather than as being colored differently (just as if we picked up a die labeled in the usual way and rolled it, we would not say that the die is now differently labeled). So, our permutation group for this problem is just the group of 12 rotations of the tetrahedron shown in Figure 5.1 and is isomorphic to  $A_{4}$ . (The group consists of the identity; eight elements of order 3, each of which fixes one vertex; and three elements of order 2, each of which fixes no vertex.) Every rotation permutes the 729 colorings, and to apply Burnside's Theorem we must determine the size of  $\mathrm{fix}(\phi)$  for each of the 12 rotations of the group.

Clearly, the identity fixes all 729 colorings. Next, consider the element (234) of order 3, shown in the bottom row, second from the left in Figure 5.1. Suppose that a specific coloring is fixed by this element (i.e., the tetrahedron appears to be colored the same before and after this rotation). Since (234) carries edge 12 to edge 13, edge 13 to edge 14, and edge 14 to edge 12, these three edges must agree in color (edge  $ij$  is the edge joining vertex  $i$  and vertex  $j$ ). The same argument shows that the three edges 23, 34, and 42 also must agree in color. So,  $|\mathrm{fix}(234)| = 3^2$ , since there are three choices for each of these two sets of three edges. The nine columns in Table 27.3 show the possible colorings of the two sets of three edges. The analogous analysis applies to the other seven elements of order 3.

Table 27.3 Nine Colorings Fixed by (234).  

<table><tr><td>Edge</td><td colspan="9">Colorings</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>R</td><td>R</td><td>R</td><td>W</td><td>W</td><td>W</td><td>B</td><td>B</td><td>B</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>R</td><td>R</td><td>R</td><td>W</td><td>W</td><td>W</td><td>B</td><td>B</td><td>B</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>R</td><td>R</td><td>R</td><td>W</td><td>W</td><td>W</td><td>B</td><td>B</td><td>B</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>R</td><td>W</td><td>B</td><td>W</td><td>R</td><td>B</td><td>B</td><td>R</td><td>W</td></tr><tr><td>34</td><td>R</td><td>W</td><td>B</td><td>W</td><td>R</td><td>B</td><td>B</td><td>R</td><td>W</td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td>R</td><td>W</td><td>B</td><td>W</td><td>R</td><td>B</td><td>B</td><td>R</td><td>W</td></tr></table>

Now consider the rotation (12)(34) of order 2. (See the second tetrahedron in the top row in Figure 5.1.) Since edges 12 and 34 are fixed, they may be colored in any way and will appear the same after the rotation (12)(34). This yields  $3 \cdot 3$  choices for those two edges. Since edge 13 is carried to edge 24, these two edges must agree in color. Similarly, edges 23 and 14 must agree. So, we have three choices for the pair of edges 13 and 24 and three choices for the pair of edges 23 and 14. This means that we have  $3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3$  ways to color the tetrahedron that will be equivalent under (12)(34). (Table 27.4 gives the complete list of 81 colorings.) So,  $|\mathrm{fix}((12)(34))| = 3^4$ , and the other

Table 27.4 81 Colorings Fixed by (12)(34) (X and Y can be any of R, W, and B.)  

<table><tr><td>Edge</td><td colspan="9">Colorings</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td><td>X</td></tr><tr><td>34</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>R</td><td>R</td><td>R</td><td>W</td><td>W</td><td>W</td><td>B</td><td>B</td><td>B</td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td>R</td><td>R</td><td>R</td><td>W</td><td>W</td><td>W</td><td>B</td><td>B</td><td>B</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>R</td><td>W</td><td>B</td><td>W</td><td>R</td><td>B</td><td>B</td><td>R</td><td>W</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>R</td><td>W</td><td>B</td><td>W</td><td>R</td><td>B</td><td>B</td><td>R</td><td>W</td></tr></table>

two elements of order 2 yield the same results.

Now that we have analyzed the three types of group elements, we can apply Burnside's Theorem. In particular, the number of distinct colorings of the edges of a tetrahedron with three colors is

$$
\frac {1}{1 2} \left(1 \cdot 3 ^ {6} + 8 \cdot 3 ^ {2} + 3 \cdot 3 ^ {4}\right) = 8 7.
$$

Surely it would be a difficult task to solve this problem without Burnside's Theorem.

Just as surely, you are wondering who besides mathematicians are interested in counting problems such as the ones we have discussed. Well, chemists are. Indeed, one set of benzene derivatives can be viewed as six carbon atoms arranged in a hexagon with one of the three radicals  $\mathrm{NH}_2$ , COOH, or OH attached at each carbon atom. See Figure 27.4 for one example.

Figure 27.4 Benzene derivative.

So Burnside's Theorem enables a chemist to determine the number of benzene molecules (see Exercise 4). Another kind of molecule considered by chemists is visualized as a regular tetrahedron with a carbon atom at the center and any of the four radicals  $\mathrm{HOCH_2}$  (hydroxymethyl),  $\mathrm{C_2H_5}$  (ethyl), Cl (chlorine), or H (hydrogen) at the four vertices. Again, the number of such molecules can be easily counted using Burnside's Theorem.

# Group Action

Our informal approach to counting the number of objects that are considered nonequivalent can be made formal as follows. If  $G$  is a group and  $S$  is a set of objects, we say that  $G$  acts on  $S$  if there is a homomorphism  $\gamma$  from  $G$  to  $\operatorname{sym}(S)$ , the group of all permutations on  $S$ . (The homomorphism is sometimes called the group action.) For convenience, we denote the image of  $g$  under  $\gamma$  as  $\gamma_g$ . Then two objects  $x$  and  $y$  in  $S$  are viewed as equivalent under the action of  $G$  if and only if  $\gamma_g(x) = y$  for some  $g$  in  $G$ .

Notice that when  $\gamma$  is one-to-one, the elements of  $G$  may be regarded as permutations on  $S$ . On the other hand, when  $\gamma$  is not one-to-one, the elements of  $G$  may still be regarded as permutations on  $S$ , but there are distinct elements  $g$  and  $h$  in  $G$  such that  $\gamma_{g}$  and  $\gamma_{h}$  induce the same permutation on  $S$  [that is,  $\gamma_{g}(x) = \gamma_{h}(x)$  for all  $x$  in  $S$ ]. Thus, a group acting on a set is a natural generalization of the permutation group concept.

As an example of group action, let  $S$  be the two diagonals of a square and let  $G$  be  $D_{4}$ , the group of symmetries of the square. Then  $\gamma_{R_0}, \gamma_{R_{180}}, \gamma_D, \gamma_{D'}$  are the identity;  $\gamma_{R_{90}}, \gamma_{R_{270}}, \gamma_H, \gamma_V$  interchange the two diagonals; and the mapping  $g \to \gamma_g$  from  $D_{4}$  to  $\operatorname{sym}(S)$  is a group homomorphism. As a second example, note that  $GL(n,F)$ , the group of invertible  $n \times n$  matrices with entries from a field  $F$ , acts on the set  $S$  of  $n \times 1$  column vectors with entries from  $F$  by multiplying the vectors on the left by the matrices. In this case, the mapping  $g \to \gamma_g$  from  $GL(n,F)$  to  $\operatorname{sym}(S)$  is a one-to-one homomorphism.

We have used group actions several times in this text without calling them that. The proof of Cayley's Theorem (Theorem 6.5) has a group  $G$  acting on the elements of  $G$ ; the proofs of Sylow's Second Theorem and Third Theorem (Theorems 23.4 and 23.5) have a group acting on the set of conjugates of a Sylow  $p$ -subgroup; and the proof of the Generalized Cayley Theorem (Theorem 24.3) has  $G$  acting on the left cosets of a subgroup  $H$ .

In one of the most abstract domains of thought, he [Burnside] has systematized and amplified its range so that, there, his work stands as a landmark in the widening expanse of knowledge. Whatever be the estimate of Burnside made by posterity, contemporaries salute him as a Master among the mathematicians of his own generation.

A. R. FORSYTH

WILLIAM BURNSIDE was born on July 2, 1852, in London. After graduating from Cambridge University in 1875, Burnside was appointed lecturer at Cambridge, where he stayed until 1885. He then accepted a position at the Royal Naval College at Greenwich and spent the rest of his career in that post.

areas of research for future generations. Here, Burnside excelled. It was he who first conjectured that a group  $G$  of odd order has a series of normal subgroups,  $G = G_{0} \geq G_{1} \geq G_{2} \geq \dots \geq G_{n} = \{e\}$ , such that  $G_{i} / G_{i + 1}$  is Abelian. This extremely important conjecture was finally proved more than 50 years later by Feit and Thompson in a 255-page paper (see Chapter 24 for more on this). In 1994, Efim Zelmanov received the Fields Medal for his work on a variation of one of Burnside's conjectures.

Burnside was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and awarded two Royal Medals. He served as president of the Council of the London Mathematical Society and received its De Morgan Medal. Burnside died on August 21, 1927.

# Motivation

In this chapter, we introduce a graphical representation of a group given by a set of generators and relations. The idea was originated by Cayley in 1878. Although this topic is not usually covered in an abstract algebra book, we include it for five reasons: It provides a method of visualizing a group; it connects two important branches of modern mathematics—groups and graphs; it has many applications to computer science; it gives a review of some of our old friends—cyclic groups, dihedral groups, direct products, and generators and relations; and, most importantly, it is fun!

Intuitively, a directed graph (or digraph) is a finite set of points, called vertices, and a set of arrows, called arcs, connecting some of the vertices. Although there is a rich and important general theory of directed graphs with many applications, we are interested only in those that arise from groups.

Let  $G$  be a finite group and let  $S$  be a set of generators for  $G$ . We define a digraph  $\operatorname{Cay}(S;G)$ , called the Cayley digraph of  $G$  with generating set  $S$ , as follows:

1. Each element of  $G$  is a vertex of  $\operatorname{Cay}(S;G)$ .  
2. For  $x$  and  $y$  in  $G$ , there is an arc from  $x$  to  $y$  if and only if  $xs = y$  for some  $s \in S$ .

To tell from the digraph which particular generator connects two vertices, Cayley proposed that each generator be assigned a color, and that the arrow joining  $x$  to  $xs$  be colored with the color assigned to  $s$ . He called the resulting figure the color graph of the group. This terminology is still used occasionally.

Rather than use colors to distinguish the different generators, we will use solid arrows, dashed arrows, and dotted arrows. In general, if there is an arc from  $x$  to  $y$ , there need not be an arc from  $y$  to  $x$ . An arrow emanating from  $x$  and pointing to  $y$  indicates that there is an arc from  $x$  to  $y$ .

Following are numerous examples of Cayley digraphs. Note that there are several ways to draw the digraph of a group given by a particular generating set. However, it is not the appearance of the digraph that is relevant but the manner in which the vertices are connected. These connections are uniquely determined by the generating set. Thus, distances between vertices and angles formed by the arcs have no significance. (In the digraphs below, a headless arrow joining two vertices  $x$  and  $y$  indicates that there is an arc from  $x$  to  $y$  and an arc from  $y$  to  $x$ . This occurs when the generating set contains both an element and its inverse. For example, a generator of order 2 is its own inverse.)

The Cayley digraph provides a quick and easy way to determine the value of any product of the generators and their inverses. Consider, for example, the product  $ab^3ab^{-2}$  from the group given in Example 7. To reduce this to one of the eight elements used to label the vertices, we need only begin at the vertex  $e$  and follow the arcs from each vertex to the next as specified in the given product. Of course,  $b^{-1}$  means traverse the  $b$  arc in reverse. (Observations such as  $b^{-3} = b$  also help.) Tracing the product through, we obtain  $b$ . Similarly, one can verify or discover other relations among the generators.

# Hamiltonian Circuits and Paths

Now that we have these directed graphs, what is it that we care to know about them? One question about directed graphs that has been the object of much research was popularized by the Irish mathematician Sir William Hamilton in 1859, when he invented a puzzle called "Around the World." His idea was to label the 20 vertices of a regular dodecahedron with the names of famous cities. One solves this puzzle by starting at any particular city (vertex) and traveling "around the world," moving along the arcs in such a way that each other city is visited exactly once before returning to the original starting point. One solution to this puzzle is given in Figure 28.1, where the vertices are visited in the order indicated.

Obviously, this idea can be applied to any digraph; that is, one starts at some vertex and attempts to traverse the digraph by moving along arcs in such a way that each vertex is visited exactly once before returning to the starting vertex. (To go from  $x$  to  $y$ , there must be an arc from  $x$  to  $y$ .) Such a sequence of arcs is called a Hamiltonian circuit in the digraph. A sequence of arcs that passes through each vertex exactly once without returning to the starting point is called a Hamiltonian path. In the rest of this chapter, we concern ourselves with the existence of Hamiltonian circuits and paths in Cayley digraphs.

Figures 28.2 and 28.3 show a Hamiltonian path for the digraph given in Example 2 and a Hamiltonian circuit for the digraph given in Example 7, respectively.

Is there a Hamiltonian circuit in

$$
\operatorname {C a y} \left(\{(1, 0), (0, 1) \}: Z _ {3} \oplus Z _ {2}\right)?
$$

More generally, let us investigate the existence of Hamiltonian circuits in

$$
\operatorname {C a y} (\{(1, 0), (0, 1) \}: Z _ {m} \oplus Z _ {n}),
$$

where  $m$  and  $n$  are relatively prime and both are greater than 1. Visualize the Cayley digraph as a rectangular grid coordinatized with  $Z_{m} \oplus Z_{n}$ , as in

Figure 28.4. Suppose there is a Hamiltonian circuit in the digraph and  $(a, b)$  is some vertex from which the circuit exits horizontally. (Clearly, such a vertex exists.) Then the circuit must exit  $(a - 1, b + 1)$  horizontally also, for otherwise the circuit passes through  $(a, b + 1)$  twice—see Figure 28.5. Repeating this argument again and again, we see that the circuit exits horizontally from each of the vertices  $(a, b), (a - 1, b + 1), (a - 2, b + 2), \ldots$ , which is just the coset  $(a, b) + \langle (-1, 1) \rangle$ . But when  $m$  and  $n$  are relatively prime,  $\langle (-1, 1) \rangle$  is the entire group. Obviously, there cannot be a Hamiltonian circuit consisting entirely of horizontal moves. Let us record what we have just proved.

# Theorem 28.1 A Necessary Condition

$\operatorname{Cay}(\{(1,0),(0,1)\} : Z_m \oplus Z_n)$  does not have a Hamiltonian circuit when  $m$  and  $n$  are relatively prime and greater than 1.

What about when  $m$  and  $n$  are not relatively prime? In general, the answer is somewhat complicated, but the following special case is easy to prove.

# Theorem 28.2 A Sufficient Condition

$\operatorname{Cay}(\{(1,0),(0,1)\} : Z_m \oplus Z_n)$  has a Hamiltonian circuit when  $n$  divides  $m$ .

PROOF Say  $m = kn$ . Then we may think of  $Z_{m} \oplus Z_{n}$  as  $k$  blocks of size  $n \times n$ . (See Figure 28.6 for an example.) Start at  $(0,0)$  and cover the vertices of the top block as follows. Use the generator  $(0,1)$  to move horizontally across the first row to the end. Then use the generator  $(1,0)$  to move vertically to the point below, and cover the remaining points in the second row by moving horizontally. Keep this process up until the point  $(n - 1,0)$ —the lower left-hand corner of the first block—has been reached. Next, move vertically to the second block and repeat the process used in the first block. Keep this up until the bottom block is covered. Complete the circuit by moving vertically back to  $(0,0)$ .

Notice that the circuit given in the proof of Theorem 28.2 is easy to visualize but somewhat cumbersome to describe in words. A much more convenient way to describe a Hamiltonian path or circuit is to specify the starting vertex and the sequence of generators in the order in which they are to be applied. In Example 5, for instance, we may start at (1) and alternate the generators (12) and (13) until we return to (1). In Example 3, we may start at  $R_0$  and successively apply  $R_{90}, R_{90}, R_{90}, H, R_{90}, R_{90}, R_{90}, H$ . When  $k$  is a positive integer and  $a, b, \ldots, c$  is a sequence of group elements, we use  $k * (a, b, \ldots, c)$  to denote the concatenation of  $k$  copies of the sequence  $(a, b, \ldots, c)$ . Thus,  $2 * (R_{90}, R_{90}, R_{90}, H)$  and  $2 * (3 * R_{90}, H)$  both mean  $R_{90}, R_{90}, R_{90}, H, R_{90}, R_{90}, R_{90}, H$ . With this notation, we may conveniently denote the Hamiltonian circuit given in Theorem 28.2 as

$$
m * ((n - 1) * (0, 1), (1, 0)).
$$

We leave it as an exercise (Exercise 11) to show that if  $x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n}$  is a sequence of generators determining a Hamiltonian circuit starting at some vertex, then the same sequence determines a Hamiltonian circuit for any starting vertex.

From Theorem 28.1, we know that there are some Cayley digraphs of Abelian groups that do not have any Hamiltonian circuits. But Theorem 28.3 shows that each of these Cayley digraphs does have a Hamiltonian path. There are some Cayley digraphs for non-Abelian groups that do not even have Hamiltonian paths, but we will not discuss them here.

# Theorem 28.3 Abelian Groups Have Hamiltonian Paths

Let  $G$  be a finite Abelian group, and let  $S$  be any generating set for  $G$ . Then  $\operatorname{Cay}(S;G)$  has a Hamiltonian path.

PROOF We use induction on  $|S|$ . If  $|S| = 1$ , say,  $S = \{a\}$ , then the digraph is just a circle labeled with  $e, a, a^2, \ldots, a^{m-1}$ , where  $|a| = m$ . Obviously, there is a Hamiltonian path for this case. Now assume that  $|S| > 1$ . Choose

![](images/a78207079985931ea1d22a4f4a0afb58fd0cd6dcc0e7109f78517feb6437c1de.jpg)  
Figure 28.6  $\mathrm{Cay}(\{(1,0),(0,1)\}:Z_{3k}\oplus Z_3)$

some  $s \in S$ . Let  $T = S - \{s\}$  that is,  $T$  is  $S$  with  $s$  removed—and set  $H = \langle s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_{n-1} \rangle$  where  $S = \{s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n\}$  and  $s = s_n$ . (Notice that  $H$  may be equal to  $G$ .)

Because  $|T| < |S|$  and  $H$  is a finite Abelian group, the induction hypothesis guarantees that there is a Hamiltonian path  $(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{k})$  in  $\operatorname{Cay}(T:H)$ . We will show that

$$
\left(a _ {1}, a _ {2}, \dots , a _ {k}, s, a _ {1}, a _ {2}, \dots , a _ {k}, s, \dots , a _ {1}, a _ {2}, \dots , a _ {k}, s, a _ {1}, a _ {2}, \dots , a _ {k}\right),
$$

where  $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k$  occurs  $|G| / |H|$  times and  $s$  occurs  $|G| / |H| - 1$  times, is a Hamiltonian path in  $\operatorname{Cay}(S; G)$ .

Since  $S = T \cup \{s\}$  and  $T$  generates  $H$ , the coset  $Hs$  generates the factor group  $G / H$ . (Since  $G$  is Abelian, this group exists.) Hence, the cosets of  $H$  are  $H, Hs, Hs^2, \ldots, Hs^n$ , where  $n = |G| / |H| - 1$ . Starting from the identity element of  $G$ , the path given by  $(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k)$  visits each element of  $H$  exactly once [because  $(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k)$  is a Hamiltonian path in  $\operatorname{Cay}(T:H)$ ]. The generator  $s$  then moves us to some element of the coset  $Hs$ . Starting from there, the path  $(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k)$  visits each element of  $Hs$  exactly once. Then,  $s$  moves us to the coset  $Hs^2$ , and we visit each element of this coset exactly once. Continuing this process, we successively move to  $Hs^3, Hs^4, \ldots, Hs^n$ , visiting each vertex in each of these cosets exactly once. Because each vertex of  $\operatorname{Cay}(S:G)$  is in exactly one coset  $Hs^i$ , this implies that we visit each vertex of  $\operatorname{Cay}(S:G)$  exactly once. Thus, we have a Hamiltonian path.

We next look at Cayley digraphs with three generators.

EXAMPLE 9 Let

$$
D _ {3} = \langle r, f | r ^ {3} = f ^ {2} = e, r f = f r ^ {2} \rangle .
$$

Then a Hamiltonian circuit in

$$
\operatorname {C a y} \left(\left\{\left(r, 0\right), (f, 0), (e, 1) \right\}: D _ {3} \oplus Z _ {6}\right)
$$

is given in Figure 28.7.

Figure 28.7 Cay  $\{((r,0),(f,0),(e,1)\} :D_3\oplus Z_6)$

Although it is not easy to prove, it is true that

$$
\operatorname {C a y} \left(\left\{\left(r, 0\right), (f, 0), (e, 1) \right\}: D _ {n} \oplus Z _ {m}\right)
$$

has a Hamiltonian circuit for all  $n$  and  $m$ . Example 10 shows the circuit for this digraph when  $m$  is even.

EXAMPLE 10 Let

$$
D _ {n} = \langle r, f | r ^ {n} = f ^ {2} = e, r f = f r ^ {- 1} \rangle .
$$

Then a Hamiltonian circuit in

$$
\operatorname {C a y} \left(\left\{\left(r, 0\right), (f, 0), (e, 1) \right\}: D _ {n} \oplus Z _ {m}\right)
$$

with  $m$  even is traced in Figure 28.8. The sequence of generators that traces the circuit is

$$
m * \left[ (n - 1) * (r, 0), (f, 0), (n - 1) * (r, 0), (e, 1) \right].
$$

# Some Applications

Cayley digraphs are natural models for interconnection networks in computer designs, and Hamiltonicity is an important property in relation to sorting algorithms on such networks. One particular Cayley digraph that is used to design and analyze interconnection networks of parallel machines is the symmetric group  $S_{n}$  with the set of all transpositions as the generating set. Hamiltonian paths and circuits in Cayley digraphs arise in a variety of group theory contexts. A Hamiltonian path in a Cayley digraph of a group is simply an ordered listing of the group elements without repetition. The vertices of the digraph are the group elements, and the arcs of the path are generators of the group. In 1948, R. A. Rankin used these ideas (although not the terminology) to prove that certain bell-ringing exercises could not be done by the traditional methods employed by bell ringers. In 1981, Hamiltonian paths in Cayley digraphs were used in an algorithm for creating computer graphics of Escher-type repeating patterns in the hyperbolic plane. This program can produce repeating hyperbolic patterns in color from among various infinite classes of symmetry groups. The program has now been improved so that the user may choose from many kinds of color symmetry.

In this chapter, we have shown how one may construct a directed graph from a group. It is also possible to associate a group—called the automorphism group—with every directed graph. In fact, several of the 26 sporadic simple groups were first constructed in this way.

WILLIAM ROWAN HAMILTON was born on August 3, 1805, in Dublin, Ireland. At three, he was skilled at reading and arithmetic. At five, he read and translated Latin, Greek, and Hebrew; at 14, he had mastered 14 languages, including Arabic, Sanskrit, Hindustani, Malay, and Bengali.

In 1833, Hamilton provided the first modern treatment of complex numbers. In 1843, he made what he considered his greatest discovery—the algebra of quaternions. The quaternions represent a natural generalization of the complex numbers with three numbers  $i$ ,  $j$ , and  $k$  whose squares are  $-1$ . With these, rotations in three and four dimensions can be algebraically treated.

Of greater significance, however, is the fact that the quaternions are non

commutative under multiplication. This was the first ring to be discovered in which the commutative property does not hold. The essential idea for the quaternions suddenly came to Hamilton after 15 years of fruitless thought! Today Hamilton's name is attached to several concepts, such as the Hamiltonian function, which represents the total energy in a physical system; the Hamilton-Jacobi differential equations; and the Cayley-Hamilton Theorem from linear algebra. He also coined the terms vector, scalar, and tensor.

Ireland has issued three postage stamps and one coin honoring Hamilton. One stamp shows the defining relations for the division ring of quaternions. The coin is a commemorative issue in honor of his bicentenary of his birth.

In his later years, Hamilton was plagued by alcoholism. He died on September 2, 1865, at the age of 60.

PAUL ERDOS (pronounced AIR-dish) was one of the best-known and most highly respected mathematicians of the 20th century. Unlike most of his contemporaries, who have concentrated on theory building, Erdős focused on problem solving and problem posing. The problems and methods of solution of Erdős—like those of Euler, whose solutions to special problems pointed the way to much of the mathematical theory we have today—have helped pioneer new theories, such as combinatorial and probabilistic number theory, combinatorial geometry, probabilistic and transfinite combinatorics, and graph theory.

Erdős was born on March 26, 1913, in Hungary. Both of his parents were high school mathematics teachers. Erdős, a Jew, left Hungary in 1934 at the age of 21 because of the rapid rise of anti-Semitism in Europe. For the rest of his life he traveled incessantly, rarely pausing more than a month in any one place, giving lectures for small honoraria

and staying with fellow mathematicians. He had little property and no fixed address.

All that he owned he carried with him in a medium-sized suitcase, frequently visiting as many as 15 places in a month. His motto was, "Another roof, another proof." Even in his eighties, he put in 19-hour days doing mathematics. Erdős wrote more than 1500 research papers. He coauthored papers with more than 500 people. These people are said to have Erdős number 1. People who do not have Erdős number 1, but who have written a paper with someone who does, are said to have Erdős number 2, and so on, inductively.

Erdős received the Cole Prize in number theory from the American Mathematical Society, the Wolf Prize for lifelong contributions, and was elected to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. Erdős died of a heart attack on September 20, 1996.

# Introduction to Algebraic Coding Theory

There is no branch of mathematics, however abstract, which may not some day be applied to phenomena of the real world.

Nikolai Lobachevsky

Damn it, if the machine can detect an error, why can't it locate the position of the error and correct it?

Richard W. Hamming

# Motivation

One of the most interesting and important applications of finite fields has been the development of algebraic coding theory. This theory, which originated in the late 1940s, was created in response to practical communication problems. (Algebraic coding has nothing to do with secret codes.) Algebraic codes are now used in compact disc and DVD players, fax machines, digital televisions, and bar code scanners, and are essential to computer maintenance.

To motivate this theory, imagine that we wish to transmit one of two possible signals to a spacecraft approaching Mars. If the proposed landing site appears unfavorable, we will command the craft to orbit the planet; otherwise, we will command the craft to land. The signal for orbiting will be a 0, and the signal for landing will be a 1. But it is possible that some sort of interference (called noise) could cause an incorrect message to be received. To decrease the chance of this happening, redundancy is built into the transmission process. For example, if we wish the craft to orbit Mars, we could send five 0's. The craft's onboard computer is programmed to take any five-digit message received and decode the result by majority rule. So, if 00000 is sent and 10001 is received, the computer decides that 0 was the intended message. Notice that, for the computer to make the wrong decision, at least three errors must occur during transmission. If we assume that errors occur independently, it is less likely that three errors will occur than that two or fewer errors will occur. For this reason, this decision process is frequently called the maximum-likelihood decoding procedure. Our particular situation is illustrated in Figure 29.1. The general coding procedure is illustrated in Figure 29.2.

In practice, the means of transmission are telephone, radiowave, microwave, or even a magnetic disk. The noise might be human error, crosstalk,

![](images/258c742cdff076760613ebe01d1a038a894a7ad9fe7c368393244d8d3a515f36.jpg)

Figure 29.2 General encoding-decoding.

lightning, thermal noise, or deterioration of a disk. Throughout this chapter, we assume that errors in transmission occur independently. Different methods are needed when this is not the case.

Now, let's consider a more complicated situation. This time, assume that we wish to send a sequence of 0's and 1's of length 500. Further, suppose that the probability that an error will be made in the transmission of any particular digit is .01. If we send this message directly, without any redundancy, the probability that it will be received error-free is (.99) $^{500}$ , or approximately .0066.

On the other hand, if we adopt a threefold repetition scheme by sending each digit three times and decoding each block of three digits received by majority rule, we can do much better. For example, the sequence 1011 is encoded as 11100011111. If the received message is 011000001110, the decoded message is 1001. Now, what is the probability that our 500-digit message will be error-free? Well, if a 1, say, is sent, it will be decoded as a 0 if and only if the block received is 001, 010, 100, or 000. The probability that this will occur is

$$
\begin{array}{l} (. 0 1) (. 0 1) (. 9 9) + (. 0 1) (. 9 9) (. 0 1) + (. 9 9) (. 0 1) (. 0 1) + (. 0 1) (. 0 1) (. 0 1) \\ = (. 0 1) ^ {2} [ 3 (. 9 9) +. 0 1 ] \\ = . 0 0 0 2 9 8 <   . 0 0 0 3. \\ \end{array}
$$

Thus, the probability that any particular digit in the sequence will be decoded correctly is greater than .9997, and it follows that the probability that the entire 500-digit message will be decoded correctly is greater than (.9997) $^{500}$ , or approximately .86—a dramatic improvement over .0066.

This example illustrates the three basic features of a code. There is a set of messages, a method of encoding these messages, and a method of decoding the received messages. The encoding procedure builds some redundancy into the original messages; the decoding procedure corrects or detects certain prescribed errors. Repetition codes have the advantage of simplicity of encoding and decoding, but they are too inefficient. In a five-fold repetition code,  $80\%$  of all transmitted information is redundant. The goal of coding theory is to devise message encoding and decoding methods that are reliable, efficient, and reasonably easy to implement.

Before plunging into the formal theory, it is instructive to look at a sophisticated example.

# EXAMPLE 1 Hamming (7, 4) Code

This time, our message set consists of all possible 4-tuples of 0's and 1's (i.e., we wish to send a sequence of 0's and 1's of length 4). Encoding will be done by viewing these messages as  $1 \times 4$  matrices with entries from  $Z_{2}$  and multiplying each of the 16 messages on the right by the matrix

$$
G = \left[ \begin{array}{c c c c c c c} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \end{array} \right].
$$

(All arithmetic is done modulo 2.) The resulting 7-tuples are called code words. (See Table 29.1.)

Table 29.1  

<table><tr><td>Message</td><td>Encoder</td><td>G</td><td>Code Word</td><td>Message</td><td>Encoder</td><td>G</td><td>Code Word</td></tr><tr><td>0000</td><td>→</td><td>0000000</td><td>0110</td><td>→</td><td>0110010</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>0001</td><td>→</td><td>0001011</td><td>0101</td><td>→</td><td>0101110</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>0010</td><td>→</td><td>0010111</td><td>0011</td><td>→</td><td>0011100</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>0100</td><td>→</td><td>0100101</td><td>1110</td><td>→</td><td>1110100</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>1000</td><td>→</td><td>1000110</td><td>1101</td><td>→</td><td>1101000</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>1100</td><td>→</td><td>1100011</td><td>1011</td><td>→</td><td>1011010</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>1010</td><td>→</td><td>1010001</td><td>0111</td><td>→</td><td>0111001</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>1001</td><td>→</td><td>1001101</td><td>1111</td><td>→</td><td>1111111</td><td></td><td></td></tr></table>

Notice that the first four digits of each code word constitute just the original message corresponding to the code word. The last three digits of the code word constitute the redundancy features. For this code, we use the nearest-neighbor decoding method (which, in the case that the errors occur independently, is the same as the maximum-likelihood decoding procedure). For any received word  $v$ , we assume that the word sent is the code word  $v'$  that differs from  $v$  in the fewest number of positions. If the choice of  $v'$  is not unique, we can decide not to decode or arbitrarily choose one of the code words closest to  $v$ . (The first option is usually selected when retransmission is practical.)

Once we have decoded the received word, we can obtain the message by deleting the last three digits of  $v'$ . For instance, suppose that 1000 were the intended message. It would be encoded and transmitted as  $u = 1000110$ . If the received word were  $v = 1100110$  (an error in the second position), it would still be decoded as  $u$ , since  $v$  and  $u$  differ in only one position, whereas  $v$  and any other code word would differ in at least two positions. Similarly, the intended message 1111 would be encoded as 1111111. If, instead of this, the word 0111111 were received, our decoding procedure would still give us the intended message 1111.

The code in Example 1 is one of an infinite class of important codes discovered by Richard Hamming in 1948. The Hamming codes are the most widely used codes.

The Hamming (7, 4) encoding scheme can be conveniently illustrated with the use of a Venn diagram, as shown in Figure 29.3. Begin by placing the four message digits in the four overlapping regions I, II, III, and IV, with the digit in position 1 in region I, the digit in position 2 in region II, and so on. For regions V, VI, and VII, assign 0 or 1 so that the total number of 1s in each circle is even.

![](images/fd260a11582a1ef4c7d97d39927dea3924def669aba35b61fd35a8c50391a9bf.jpg)

Consider the Venn diagram of the received word 0001101:

![](images/57757e70dac3b69b7327f504c9cc2478550f3bf90e824139f25edf5bc67f1434.jpg)

How may we detect and correct an error? Well, observe that each of the circles  $A$  and  $B$  has an odd number of 1s. This tells us that something is wrong. At the same time, we note that circle  $C$  has an even number of 1s. Thus, the portion of the diagram that is in both  $A$  and  $B$  but not in  $C$  is the source of the error. See Figure 29.4.

Quite often, codes are used to detect errors rather than correct them. This is especially appropriate when it is easy to retransmit a message. If a received word is not a code word, we have detected an error. For example, computers are designed to use a parity check for numbers. Inside the computer, each number is represented by a string of 0's and 1's. If there is an even number of 1's in this representation, a 0 is attached to the string; if there is an odd number of 1's in the representation, a 1 is attached to the string. Thus, each

number stored in the computer memory has an even number of 1's. Now, when the computer reads a number from memory, it performs a parity check. If the read number has an odd number of 1's, the computer will know that an error has been made, and it will reread the number. Note that an even number of errors will not be detected by a parity check.

Figure 29.4 Circles  $A$  and  $B$  but not  $C$  have wrong parity.

The methods of error detection introduced in Chapters 0 and 5 are based on the same principle. An extra character is appended to a string of numbers so that a particular condition is satisfied. If we find that such a string does not satisfy that condition, we know that an error has occurred.

# Linear Codes

We now formalize some of the ideas introduced in the preceding discussion.

# Definitions Linear Code

An  $(n,k)$  linear code over a finite field  $F$  is a  $k$ -dimensional subspace  $V$  of the vector space

$$
F ^ {n} = \underbrace {F \oplus F \oplus \cdots \oplus F} _ {n \text {c o p i e s}}
$$

over  $F$ . The members of  $V$  are called the code words. When  $F$  is  $Z_{2}$ , the code is called binary.

One should think of an  $(n, k)$  linear code over  $F$  as a set of  $n$ -tuples from  $F$ , where each  $n$ -tuple has two parts: the message part, consisting of  $k$  digits; and the redundancy part, consisting of the remaining  $n - k$  digits. Note that an  $(n, k)$  linear code over a finite field  $F$  of order  $q$  has  $q^k$  code words, since every member of the code is uniquely expressible as a linear combination of the  $k$  basis vectors with coefficients from  $F$ . The set of  $q^k$  code words is closed under addition and scalar multiplication by members of  $F$ . Also, since errors in transmission may occur in any of the  $n$  positions, there are  $q^n$  possible vectors that can be received. Where there is no possibility of confusion, it is

customary to denote an  $n$ -tuple  $(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n})$  more simply as  $a_{1}a_{2}\dots a_{n}$ , as we did in Example 1.

EXAMPLE 2 The set

{0000000,0010111,0101011，1001101，

1100110, 1011010, 0111100, 1110001}

is a (7, 3) binary code.

EXAMPLE 3 The set  $\{0000, 0101, 1010, 1111\}$  is a  $(4,2)$  binary code.

Although binary codes are by far the most important ones, other codes are occasionally used.

EXAMPLE 4 The set

{0000,0121,0212,1022,1110,1201,2011,2102,2220}

is a  $(4,2)$  linear code over  $Z_{3}$ . A linear code over  $Z_{3}$  is called a ternary code.

To facilitate our discussion of the error-correcting and error-detecting capability of a code, we introduce the following terminology.

# Definitions Hamming Distance, Hamming Weight

The Hamming distance between two vectors in  $F^n$  is the number of components in which they differ. The Hamming weight of a vector is the number of nonzero components of the vector. The Hamming weight of a linear code is the minimum weight of any nonzero vector in the code.

We will use  $d(u, v)$  to denote the Hamming distance between the vectors  $u$  and  $v$ , and  $\mathrm{wt}(u)$  for the Hamming weight of the vector  $u$ .

EXAMPLE 5 Let  $s = 0010111$ ,  $t = 0101011$ ,  $u = 1001101$ , and  $v = 1101101$ . Then,  $d(s, t) = 4$ ,  $d(s, u) = 4$ ,  $d(s, v) = 5$ ,  $d(u, v) = 1$ ; and  $\operatorname{wt}(s) = 4$ ,  $\operatorname{wt}(t) = 4$ ,  $\operatorname{wt}(u) = 4$ ,  $\operatorname{wt}(v) = 5$ .

The Hamming distance and Hamming weight have the following important properties.

# Theorem 29.1 Properties of Hamming Distance and Hamming Weight

For any vectors  $u, v$ , and  $w, d(u, v) \leq d(u, w) + d(w, v)$  and  $d(u, v) = \mathrm{wt}(u - v)$ .

PROOF To prove that  $d(u,v) = \mathrm{wt}(u - v)$ , simply observe that both  $d(u,v)$  and  $\mathrm{wt}(u - v)$  equal the number of positions in which  $u$  and  $v$  differ. To prove that  $d(u,v) \leq d(u,w) + d(w,v)$ , note that if  $u$  and  $v$  differ in the  $i$ th position and  $u$  and  $w$  agree in the  $i$ th position, then  $w$  and  $v$  differ in the  $i$ th position.

With the preceding definitions and Theorem 29.1, we can now explain why the codes given in Examples 1, 2, and 4 will correct any single error, but the code in Example 3 will not.

# Theorem 29.2 Correcting Capability of a Linear Code

If the Hamming weight of a linear code is at least  $2t + 1$ , then the code can correct any  $t$  or fewer errors. Alternatively, the same code can detect any  $2t$  or fewer errors.

PROOF We will use nearest-neighbor decoding; that is, for any received vector  $v$ , we will assume that the corresponding code word sent is a code word  $v'$  such that the Hamming distance  $d(v, v')$  is a minimum. (If there is more than one such  $v'$ , we do not decode.) Now, suppose that a transmitted code word  $u$  is received as the vector  $v$  and that at most  $t$  errors have been made in transmission. Then, by the definition of distance between  $u$  and  $v$ , we have  $d(u, v) \leq t$ . If  $w$  is any code word other than  $u$ , then  $w - u$  is a nonzero code word. Thus, by assumption,

$$
2 t + 1 \leq \operatorname {w t} (w - u) = d (w, u) \leq d (w, v) + d (v, u) \leq d (w, v) + t,
$$

and it follows that  $t + 1 \leq d(w, v)$ . So, the code word closest to the received vector  $v$  is  $u$ , and therefore  $v$  is correctly decoded as  $u$ .

To show that the code can detect  $2t$  errors, we suppose that a transmitted code word  $u$  is received as the vector  $v$  and that at least one error, but no more than  $2t$  errors, was made in transmission. Because only code words are transmitted, an error will be detected whenever a received word is not a code word. But  $v$  cannot be a code word, since  $d(v, u) \leq 2t$ , whereas we know that the minimum distance between distinct code words is at least  $2t + 1$ .

EXAMPLE 6 Since the binary code  $\{000, 001, 010, 100, 110, 101, 011, 111\}$  has weight  $1 = 2t + 1$ , it will not detect any error ( $t = 0$ ).

Since the binary code  $\{0000, 0101, 1010, 1111\}$  has weight  $2 = 2t + 1$ , it will not correct every 1 error ( $t = 1/2$ ) but it will detect any 1 error.

Since the binary code  $\{000000, 100110, 010101, 110011, 001011, 101101, 011110, 111000\}$  has weight  $3 = 2t + 1$ , it will correct any 1 error ( $t = 1$ ) or it will detect any 2 or fewer errors.

Since the binary code  $\{0000000, 0010111, 0101011, 1001101, 1100110, 1011010, 0111100, 1110001\}$  has weight  $4 = 2t + 1$ , it will correct any 1 error  $(t = 3/2)$  or it will detect any 3 or fewer errors.

Theorem 29.2 is often misinterpreted to mean that a linear code with Hamming weight  $2t + 1$  can correct any  $t$  errors and detect any  $2t$  or fewer errors simultaneously. This is not the case. The user must choose one or the other role for the code. Consider, for example, the Hamming (7, 4) code given in Table 29.1. By inspection, the Hamming weight of the code is  $3 = 2 \cdot 1 + 1$ , so we may elect either to correct any single error or to detect any one or two errors. To understand why we can't do both, consider the received word 0001010. The intended message could have been 0000000, in which case two

errors were made (likewise for the intended messages 1011010 and 0101110), or the intended message could have been 0001011, in which case one error was made. But there is no way for us to know which of these possibilities occurred. If our choice were error correction, we would assume—perhaps mistakenly—that 0001011 was the intended message. If our choice were error detection, we simply would not decode. (Typically, one would request retransmission.)

On the other hand, if we write the Hamming weight of a linear code in the form  $2t + s + 1$ , we can correct any  $t$  errors and detect any  $t + s$  or fewer errors. Thus, for a code with Hamming weight 5, our options include the following:

1. Detect any four errors  $(t = 0, s = 4)$ .  
2. Correct any one error and detect any two or three errors ( $t = 1, s = 2$ ).  
3. Correct any two errors  $(t = 2, s = 0)$ .

EXAMPLE 7 Since the Hamming weight of the linear code given in Example 2 is 4, it will correct any single error and detect any two errors  $(t = 1, s = 1)$  or detect any three errors  $(t = 0, s = 3)$ .

It is natural to wonder how the matrix  $G$  used to produce the Hamming code in Example 1 was chosen. Better yet, in general, how can one find a matrix  $G$  that carries a subspace  $V$  of  $F^k$  to a subspace of  $F^n$  in such a way that for any  $k$ -tuple  $v$  in  $V$ , the vector  $vG$  will agree with  $v$  in the first  $k$  components and build in some redundancy in the last  $n - k$  components? Such a matrix is a  $k \times n$  matrix of the form

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{c c c c c c c} 1 & 0 & \dots & 0 & a _ {1 1} & \dots & a _ {1 n - k} \\ 0 & 1 & \dots & 0 & \cdot & & \cdot \\ \cdot & \cdot & & \cdot & \cdot & & \cdot \\ \cdot & \cdot & & \cdot & \cdot & & \cdot \\ \cdot & \cdot & & \cdot & \cdot & & \cdot \\ 0 & 0 & \dots & 1 & a _ {k 1} & \dots & a _ {k n - k} \end{array} \right]
$$

where the  $a_{ij}$ 's belong to  $F$ . A matrix of this form is called the standard generator matrix (or standard encoding matrix) for the resulting code.

Any  $k \times n$  matrix whose rows are linearly independent will transform  $F^k$  to a  $k$ -dimensional subspace of  $F^n$  that could be used to build redundancy, but using the standard generator matrix has the advantage that the original message constitutes the first  $k$  components of the transformed vectors. An  $(n,k)$  linear code in which the  $k$  information digits occur at the beginning of each code word is called a systematic code. Schematically, we have the following.

message  $\longrightarrow$  message + redundant digits  $k$  digits  $k$  digits  $+n - k$  digits

Notice that, by definition, a standard generator matrix produces a systematic code.

EXAMPLE 8 From the set of messages

$$
\{0 0 0, 0 0 1, 0 1 0, 1 0 0, 1 1 0, 1 0 1, 0 1 1, 1 1 1 \},
$$

we may construct a (6, 3) linear code over  $Z_{2}$  with the standard generator matrix

$$
G = \left[ \begin{array}{c c c c c c} 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \end{array} \right].
$$

The resulting code words are given in Table 29.2. Since the minimum weight of any nonzero code word is 3, this code will correct any single error or detect any double error.

Table 29.2

EXAMPLE 9 Here we take a set of messages as

$$
\{0 0, 0 1, 0 2, 1 0, 1 1, 1 2, 2 0, 2 1, 2 2 \},
$$

and we construct a (4, 2) linear code over  $Z_{3}$  with the standard generator matrix

$$
G = \left[ \begin{array}{c c c c} 1 & 0 & 2 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 2 & 2 \end{array} \right].
$$

The resulting code words are given in Table 29.3. Since the minimum weight of the code is 3, it will correct any single error or detect any double error.

# Parity-Check Matrix Decoding

Now that we can conveniently encode messages with a standard generator matrix, we need a convenient method for decoding the received messages. Unfortunately, this is not as easy to do; however, in the case where at most one error per code word has occurred, there is a fairly simple method for decoding. (When more than one error occurs in a code word, our decoding method fails.)

To describe this method, suppose that  $V$  is a systematic linear code over the field  $F$  given by the standard generator matrix  $G = [I_k|A]$ , where  $I_{k}$  represents the  $k\times k$  identity matrix and  $A$  is the  $k\times (n - k)$  matrix obtained

Table 29.3  

<table><tr><td>Message</td><td>Encoder G</td><td>Code Word</td></tr><tr><td>00</td><td>→</td><td>0000</td></tr><tr><td>01</td><td>→</td><td>0122</td></tr><tr><td>02</td><td>→</td><td>0211</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>→</td><td>1021</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>→</td><td>1110</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>→</td><td>1202</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>→</td><td>2012</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>→</td><td>2101</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>→</td><td>2220</td></tr></table>

from  $G$  by deleting the first  $k$  columns of  $G$ . Then, the  $n \times (n - k)$  matrix

$$
H = \left[ \frac {- A}{I _ {n - k}} \right],
$$

where  $-A$  is the negative of  $A$  and  $I_{n - k}$  is the  $(n - k)\times (n - k)$  identity matrix, is called the parity-check matrix for  $V$ . (In the literature, the transpose of  $H$  is called the parity-check matrix, but  $H$  is much more convenient for our purposes.) The decoding procedure is:

1. For any received word  $w$ , compute  $wH$ .  
2. If  $wH$  is the zero vector, assume that no error was made.  
3. If there is exactly one instance of a nonzero element  $s \in F$  and a row  $i$  of  $H$  such that  $wH$  is  $s$  times row  $i$ , assume that the sent word was  $w - (0 \dots s \dots 0)$ , where  $s$  occurs in the  $i$ th component. If there is more than one such instance, do not decode.  
$\mathbf{3^{\prime}}$ . When the code is binary, category 3 reduces to the following: If  $wH$  is the  $i$ th row of  $H$  for exactly one  $i$ , assume that an error was made in the  $i$ th component of  $w$ . If  $wH$  is more than one row of  $H$ , do not decode.  
4. If  $wH$  does not fit into either category 2 or category 3, we know that at least two errors occurred in transmission and we do not decode.

EXAMPLE 10 Consider the Hamming (7, 4) code given in Example 1. The generator matrix is

$$
G = \left[ \begin{array}{c c c c c c c} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \end{array} \right].
$$

and the corresponding parity-check matrix is

$$
H = \left[ \begin{array}{c c c} 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{array} \right].
$$

Now, if the received vector is  $v = 0000110$ , we find  $vH = 110$ . Since this is the first row of  $H$  and no other row, we assume that an error has been made in the first position of  $v$ . Thus, the transmitted code word is assumed to be 1000110, and the corresponding message is assumed to be 1000. Similarly, if  $w = 1011111$  is the received word, then  $wH = 101$ , and we assume that an error has been made in the second position. So, we assume that 1111111 was sent and that 1111 was the intended message. If the encoded message 1001101 is received as  $z = 1001011$  (with errors in the fifth and sixth positions), we find  $zH = 110$ . Since this matches the first row of  $H$ , we decode  $z$  as 0001011 and incorrectly assume that the message 0001 was intended. On the other hand, nearest-neighbor decoding would yield the same incorrect result.

Notice that when only one error was made in transmission, the parity-check decoding procedure gave us the originally intended message. We will soon see under what conditions this is true, but first we need an important fact relating a code given by a generator matrix and its parity-check matrix.

# Lemma 29.1 Orthogonality Relation

Let  $C$  be a systematic  $(n, k)$  linear code over  $F$  with a standard generator matrix  $G$  and parity-check matrix  $H$ . Then, for any vector  $v$  in  $F^n$ , we have  $vH = 0$  (the zero vector) if and only if  $v$  belongs to  $C$ .

PROOF First note that, since  $H$  has rank  $n - k$ , we may think of  $H$  as a linear transformation from  $F^n$  onto  $F^{n - k}$ . Therefore, it follows from the dimension theorem for linear transformations that  $n = n - k + \dim (\operatorname{Ker}H)$ , so that  $\operatorname{Ker}H$  has dimension  $k$ . (Alternatively, one can use a group theory argument to show that  $|\operatorname{Ker}H| = |F|^k$ .) Then, since the dimension of  $C$  is also  $k$ , it suffices to show that  $C \subseteq \operatorname{Ker}H$ . To do this, let  $G = [I_k|A]$ , so that  $H = \left[\frac{-A}{I_{n - k}}\right]$ . Then,

$$
G H = \left[ I _ {k} | A \right] \left[ \frac {- A}{I _ {n - k}} \right] = - A + A = [ 0 ] \quad (\mathrm {t h e z e r o m a t r i x}).
$$

Now, by definition, any vector  $v$  in  $C$  has the form  $mG$ , where  $m$  is a message vector. Thus,  $vH = (mG)H = m(GH) = m[0] = 0$  (the zero vector).

Because of the way  $H$  was defined, the parity-check matrix method correctly decodes any received word in which no error has been made. But it will do more.

# Theorem 29.3 Parity-Check Matrix Decoding

Parity-check matrix decoding will correct any single error if and only if no one row is a scalar multiple of any other row.

PROOF For simplicity's sake, we prove only the binary case. In this special situation, the condition on the rows is that they are nonzero and distinct. So, let  $H$  be the parity-check matrix, and let's assume that this condition holds for the rows. Suppose that the transmitted code word  $w$  was received with only one error, and that this error occurred in the  $i$ th position. Denoting the vector that has a 1 in the  $i$ th position and 0's elsewhere by  $e_i$ , we may write the received word as  $w + e_i$ . Now, using the Orthogonality Lemma, we obtain

$$
(w + e _ {i}) H = w H + e _ {i} H = 0 + e _ {i} H = e _ {i} H.
$$

But this last vector is precisely the  $i$ th row of  $H$ . Thus, if there was exactly one error in transmission, we can use the rows of the parity-check matrix to identify the location of the error, provided that these rows are distinct. (If two rows, say, the  $i$ th and  $j$ th, are the same, we know that the error occurred in either the  $i$ th position or the  $j$ th position, but we do not know in which.)

Conversely, suppose that the parity-check matrix method correctly decodes all received words in which at most one error has been made in transmission and that the  $i$ th row of  $H$  and the  $j$ th row of  $H$  are equal and  $i \neq j$ . Then, if some code word  $w$  is transmitted and the received word is  $w + e_i$  (i.e., there is a single error in the  $i$ th position), we find

$$
\left(w + e _ {i}\right) H = w H + e _ {i} H = i \text {t h r o w o f} H = j \text {t h r o w o f} H.
$$

Thus, our decoding procedure tells us not to decode. This contradicts our assumption that the method correctly decodes all received words in which at most one error has been made.

# Coset Decoding

There is another convenient decoding method that utilizes the fact that an  $(n,k)$  linear code  $C$  over a finite field  $F$  is a subgroup of the additive group of  $V = F^n$ . This method was devised by David Slepian in 1956 and is called coset decoding (or standard decoding). To use this method, we proceed by constructing a table, called a standard array. The first row of the table is the set  $C$  of code words, beginning in column 1 with the identity  $0 \cdots 0$ . To form additional rows of the table, choose an element  $v$  of  $V$  not listed in the table thus far. Among all the elements of the coset  $v + C$ , choose one of minimum weight, say,  $v'$ . Complete the next row of the table by placing under the column headed by the code word  $c$  the vector  $v' + c$ . Continue this process until all the vectors in  $V$  have been listed in the table. [Note that an  $(n,k)$  linear code over a field with  $q$  elements will have  $|V : C| = q^{n-k}$  rows.] The

words in the first column are called the coset leaders. The decoding procedure is simply to decode any received word  $w$  as the code word at the head of the column containing  $w$ .

EXAMPLE 11 Consider the (6, 3) binary linear code

$$
C = \{0 0 0 0 0 0, 1 0 0 1 1 0, 0 1 0 1 0 1, 0 0 1 0 1 1, 1 1 0 0 1 1, 1 0 1 1 0 1, 0 1 1 1 1 0, 1 1 1 0 0 0 \}.
$$

The first row of a standard array is just the elements of  $C$ . Obviously, 100000 is not in  $C$  and has minimum weight among the elements of  $100000 + C$ , so it can be used to lead the second row. Table 29.4 is the completed table.

Table 29.4 A Standard Array for a (6, 3) Linear Code.  

<table><tr><td rowspan="9">Coset

If the word 101001 is received, it is decoded as 101101, since 101001 lies in the column headed by 101101. Similarly, the received word 011001 is decoded as 111000.

Recall that the first method of decoding that we introduced was the nearest-neighbor method; that is, any received word  $w$  is decoded as the code word  $c$  such that  $d(w, c)$  is a minimum, provided that there is only one code word  $c$  such that  $d(w, c)$  is a minimum. The next result shows that in this situation, coset decoding is the same as nearest-neighbor decoding.

# Theorem 29.4 Coset Decoding Is Nearest-Neighbor Decoding

In coset decoding, a received word  $w$  is decoded as a code word  $c$  such that  $d(w, c)$  is a minimum.

PROOF Let  $C$  be a linear code, and let  $w$  be any received word. Suppose that  $v$  is the coset leader for the coset  $w + C$ . Then,  $w + C = v + C$ , so  $w = v + c$  for some  $c$  in  $C$ . Thus, using coset decoding,  $w$  is decoded as  $c$ . Now, if  $c'$  is any code word, then  $w - c' \in w + C = v + C$ , so that  $\mathrm{wt}(w - c') \geq \mathrm{wt}(v)$ , since the coset leader  $v$  was chosen as a vector of minimum weight among the members of  $v + C$ .

Therefore,

$$
d (w, c ^ {\prime}) = \operatorname {w t} (w - c ^ {\prime}) \geq \operatorname {w t} (v) = \operatorname {w t} (w - c) = d (w, c).
$$

So, using coset decoding,  $w$  is decoded as a code word  $c$  such that  $d(w, c)$  is a minimum.

Recall that in our description of nearest-neighbor decoding, we stated that if the choice for the nearest neighbor of a received word  $v$  is not unique, then we can decide not to decode or to decode  $v$  arbitrarily from among those words closest to  $v$ . In the case of coset decoding, the decoded value of  $v$  is always uniquely determined by the coset leader of the row containing the received word. Of course, this decoded value may not be the word that was sent.

When we know a parity-check matrix for a linear code, coset decoding can be considerably simplified.

# Definition Syndrome

If an  $(n,k)$  linear code over  $F$  has parity-check matrix  $H$ , then, for any vector  $u$  in  $F^n$ , the vector  $uH$  is called the syndrome of  $u$ .

The importance of syndromes stems from the following property.

# Theorem 29.5 Same Coset—Same Syndrome

Let  $C$  be an  $(n, k)$  linear code over  $F$  with a parity-check matrix  $H$ . Then, two vectors of  $F^n$  are in the same coset of  $C$  if and only if they have the same syndrome.

PROOF Two vectors  $u$  and  $v$  are in the same coset of  $C$  if and only if  $u - v$  is in  $C$ . So, by the Orthogonality Lemma,  $u$  and  $v$  are in the same coset if and only if  $0 = (u - v)H = uH - vH$ .

We may now use syndromes for decoding any received word  $w$ :

1. Calculate  $wH$ , the syndrome of  $w$ .  
2. Find the coset leader  $v$  such that  $wH = vH$ .  
3. Assume that the vector sent was  $w - v$ .

With this method, we can decode any received word with a table that has only two rows—one row of coset leaders and another row with the corresponding syndromes.

EXAMPLE 12 Consider the code given in Example 11. The parity-check matrix for this code is

$$
H = \left[ \begin{array}{c c c} 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{array} \right].
$$

<table><tr><td>Coset leader</td><td>000000</td><td>100000</td><td>010000</td><td>001000</td><td>000100</td><td>000010</td><td>000001</td><td>100001</td></tr><tr><td>Syndromes</td><td>000</td><td>110</td><td>101</td><td>011</td><td>100</td><td>010</td><td>001</td><td>111</td></tr></table>

The list of coset leaders and corresponding syndromes is the following. So, to decode the received word  $w = 101001$ , we compute  $wH = 100$ . Since the coset leader  $v = 000100$  has 100 as its syndrome, we assume that  $w - 000100 = 101101$  was sent. If the received word is  $w' = 011001$ , we compute  $w'H = 111$  and assume  $w' - 100001 = 111000$  was sent because 100001 is the coset leader with syndrome 111. Notice that these answers are in agreement with those obtained by using the standard-array method of Example 11.

The term syndrome is a descriptive term. In medicine, it is used to designate a collection of symptoms that typify a disorder. In coset decoding, the syndrome typifies an error pattern.

In this chapter, we have presented algebraic coding theory in its simplest form. A more sophisticated treatment would make substantially greater use of group theory, ring theory, and especially finite-field theory. For example, Gorenstein (see Chapter 24 for a biography) and Zierler, in 1961, made use of the fact that the multiplicative subgroup of a finite field is cyclic. They associated each digit of certain codes with a field element in such a way that an algebraic equation would be derived whose zeros determined the locations of the errors.

In some instances, two error-correcting codes are employed. The European Space Agency space probe Giotto, which came within 370 miles of the nucleus of Halley's Comet in 1986, had two error-correcting codes built into its electronics. One code checked for independently occurring errors, and another—a so-called Reed-Solomon code—checked for bursts of errors. Giotto achieved an error-detection rate of 0.999999. Reed-Solomon codes are also used on compact discs. They can correct thousands of consecutive errors.

# Historical Note

# The Ubiquitous Reed-Solomon Codes<sup>1</sup>

Irving Reed and Gustave Solomon monitor the encounter of Voyager II with Neptune at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 1989.

![](images/0ec5929b9de5546f15905c2c9d7fa4773fd9570b4d7b92d2c8153f4e142afc81.jpg)  
SIAM NEWS January 1993, Volume 25, Number 1, pages 1 and 11

We conclude this chapter with an adapted version of an article by Barry A. Cipra about the Reed-Solomon codes [1]. It was the first in a series of articles called "Mathematics That Counts" in SIAM News, the news journal of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics. The articles highlight developments in mathematics that have led to products and processes of substantial benefit to industry and the public.

In this "Age of Information," no one need be reminded of the importance not only of speed but also of accuracy in the storage, retrieval, and transmission of data. Machines do make errors, and their non-man-made mistakes can turn otherwise flawless programming into worthless, even dangerous, trash. Just as architects design buildings that will remain standing even through an earthquake, their computer counterparts have come up with sophisticated techniques capable of counteracting digital disasters.

The idea for the current error-correcting techniques for everything from computer hard disk drives to CD players was first introduced in 1960 by Irving Reed and Gustave Solomon, then staff members at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory. . .

"When you talk about CD players and digital audio tape and now digital television, and various other digital imaging systems that are coming—all of those need Reed-Solomon [codes] as an integral part of the system," says Robert McEliece, a coding theorist in the electrical engineering department at Caltech.

Why? Because digital information, virtually by definition, consists of strings of "bits"—0's and 1's—and a physical device, no matter how capably manufactured, may occasionally confuse the two. Voyager II, for example, was transmitting data at incredibly low power—barely a whisper—over tens of millions of miles. Disk drives pack data so densely that a read/write head can (almost) be excused if it can't tell where one bit stops and the next 1

(or 0) begins. Careful engineering can reduce the error rate to what may sound like a negligible level—the industry standard for hard disk drives is 1 in 10 billion—but given the volume of information processing done these days, that "negligible" level is an invitation to daily disaster. Error-correcting codes are a kind of safety net—mathematical insurance against the vagaries of an imperfect material world.

In 1960, the theory of error-correcting codes was only about a decade old. The basic theory of reliable digital communication had been set forth by Claude Shannon in the late 1940s. At the same time, Richard Hamming introduced an elegant approach to single-error correction and double-error detection. Through the 1950s, a number of researchers began experimenting with a variety of error-correcting codes. But with their SIAM journal paper, McEliece says, Reed and Solomon "hit the jackpot."

The payoff was a coding system based on groups of bits—such as bytes—rather than individual 0's and 1's. That feature makes Reed-Solomon codes particularly good at dealing with "bursts" of errors: six consecutive bit errors, for example, can affect at most two bytes. Thus, even a double-error-correction version of a Reed-Solomon code can provide a comfortable safety factor. . . .

Mathematically, Reed-Solomon codes are based on the arithmetic of finite fields. Indeed, the 1960 paper begins by defining a code as "a mapping from a vector space of dimension  $m$  over a finite field  $K$  into a vector space of higher dimension over the same field." Starting from a "message"  $(a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{m-1})$ , where each  $a_k$  is an element of the field  $K$ , a Reed-Solomon code produces  $(P(0), P(g), P(g^2), \ldots, P(g^{N-1}))$ ,

where  $N$  is the number of elements in  $K$ ,  $g$  is a generator of the (cyclic) group of nonzero elements in  $K$ , and  $P(x)$  is the polynomial  $a_0 + a_1x + \dots + a_{m-1}x^{m-1}$ . If  $N$  is greater than  $m$ , then the values of  $P$  overdetermine the polynomial, and the properties of finite fields guarantee that the coefficients of  $P$ —that is, the original message—can be recovered from any  $m$  of the values . .

In today's byte-sized world, for example, it might make sense to let  $K$  be the field of order  $2^{8}$ , so that each element of  $K$  corresponds to a single byte (in computerese, there are four bits to a nibble and two nibbles to a byte). In that case,  $N = 2^{8} = 256$  and hence messages up to 251 bytes long can be recovered even if two errors occur in transmitting the values  $P(0), P(g), \ldots, P(g^{255})$ . That's a lot better than the 1255 bytes required by the say-everything-five-times approach.

Despite their advantages, Reed-Solomon codes did not go into use immediately—they had to wait for the hardware technology to catch up. "In 1960, there was no such thing as fast digital electronics"—at least not by today's standards, says McEliece. The Reed-Solomon paper "suggested some nice ways to process data, but nobody knew if it was practical or not, and in 1960 it probably wasn't practical."

But technology did catch up, and numerous researchers began to work on implementing the codes. . . . Many other bells and whistles (some of fundamental theoretic significance) have also been added. Compact discs, for example, use a version of a Reed-Solomon code.

Reed was among the first to recognize the significance of abstract algebra as the basis for error-correcting

codes. "In hindsight it seems obvious," he told SIAM News. However, he added, "coding theory was not a subject when we published that paper." The two authors knew they had a nice result; they didn't know what impact the paper would have.

Three decades later, the impact is clear. The vast array of applications, both current and pending, has

settled the question of the practicality and significance of Reed-Solomon codes. "It's clear they're practical, because everybody's using them now," says Elwyn Berkekamp. Billions of dollars in modern technology depend on ideas that stem from Reed and Solomon's original work. In short, says McEliece, "it's been an extraordinarily influential paper."

RICHARD W. HAMMING was born in Chicago, Illinois, on February 11, 1915. He graduated from the University of Chicago with a B.S. degree in mathematics. In 1939, he received an M.A. degree in mathematics from the University of Nebraska and, in 1942, a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Illinois.

During the latter part of World War II, Hamming was at Los Alamos, where he was involved in computing atomic-bomb designs. In 1946, he joined Bell Telephone Laboratories, where he worked in mathematics, computing, engineering, and science. In 1950, Hamming published his famous paper on error-detecting and error-correcting codes. This work started a branch of information theory.

The Hamming codes are used in many modern computers. Hamming's work in the field of numerical analysis has also been of fundamental importance.

Hamming received numerous prestigious awards, including the Turing Prize from the Association for Computing Machinery, the Piore Award from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), and the Oender Award from the University of Pennsylvania. In 1986 the IEEE Board of Directors established the Richard W. Hamming Medal "for exceptional contributions to information sciences, systems and technology" and named Hamming as its first recipient. Hamming died of a heart attack on January 7, 1998, at age 82.

An important contributor to coding theory was Jessie MacWilliams. She was born in 1917 in England. After studying at Cambridge University, MacWilliams came to the United States in 1939 to attend Johns Hopkins University. After one year at Johns Hopkins, she went to Harvard for a year.

In 1955, MacWilliams became a programmer at Bell Labs, where she learned about coding theory. Although she made a major discovery about codes while a programmer, she could not obtain a promotion to a math research position without a Ph.D. degree. She completed some of the requirements for the Ph.D. while working full-time at Bell Labs and looking after her family. She then returned to Harvard for a year (1961-1962), where she finished her degree.

Interestingly, both MacWilliams and her daughter Ann were studying mathematics at Harvard at the same time. MacWilliams returned to Bell Labs, where she remained until her retirement in 1983. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers published an issue of its journal IEEE on Information Theory Transactions containing papers dedicated to her in 1983. While at Bell Labs, she made many contributions to the subject of error-correcting codes, including The Theory of Error-Correcting Codes, written jointly with Neil Sloane. One of her results of great theoretical importance is known as the MacWilliams Identity. She died on May 27, 1990, at the age of 73.

Vera Stepen Pless was a groundbreaking mathematician whose tenacity and grit helped open the door for women mathematicians. Her work in algebraic coding theory was foundational, and her impact on the subject was enormous. In 2013, she was named a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society.

STEVEN T. DOUGHERTY, GRETCHEN L. MATTHEws, AND JAY A. WOOD, Notices of the AMS December 2022

VERA PLESS was born on March 5, 1931, to Russian immigrants on the West Side of Chicago. She accepted a scholarship to attend the University of Chicago at age 15. The program at Chicago emphasized great literature but paid little attention to physics and mathematics. At age 18, with no more than one pre-calculus course in mathematics, she entered the prestigious graduate program in mathematics at Chicago, where, at that time, there were no women on the mathematics faculty or even women colloquium speakers. After passing her master's exam, she took a job as a research associate at Northwestern University while pursuing a Ph.D. there. In 1957, she obtained her degree. Over the next several years, Pless stayed at home to raise her children while teaching part-time at Boston University.

When she decided to work full-time, she found that women were not welcome at most colleges and universities. One person told her out-right, "I would never hire a woman." Fortunately, there was an Air Force Lab in the area that had a group working on error-correcting codes. Although she had never even heard of coding theory, she was hired because of her background in algebra. When the lab discontinued basic research, she took a position as a research associate at MIT in 1972. In 1975, she went to the University of Illinois-Chicago, where she remained until her retirement.

During her career, Pless wrote more than 100 research papers, authored a widely used textbook on coding theory, and had 12 Ph. D. students. Pless died on March 2, 2020 at the age of 88.

# An Introduction to Galois Theory

It [Galois's work] is now considered as one of the pillars of modern mathematics.

Edward Frenkel, Love and Math

Today 'Galois groups' are ubiquitous in the literature, and the group idea has proved to be perhaps the most versatile in all mathematics, clarifying many a deep mystery. "When in doubt," the great André Weil advised, look for the group. "That's thecherche la femme of mathematics."

Jim Holt, The New York Review of Books, December 5, 2013

# Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory

The Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory is one of the most elegant theorems in mathematics. Look at Figures 30.1 and 30.2. Figure 30.1 depicts the lattice of subgroups of the group of field automorphisms of  $Q(\sqrt[4]{2}, i)$ . The integer along an upward lattice line from a group  $H_1$  to a group  $H_2$  is the index of  $H_1$  in  $H_2$ . Figure 30.2 shows the lattice of subfields of  $Q(\sqrt[4]{2}, i)$ . The integer along an upward line from a field  $K_1$  to a field  $K_2$  is the degree of  $K_2$  over  $K_1$ . Notice that the lattice in Figure 30.2 is the lattice of Figure 30.1 turned upside down. This is only one of many relationships between these two lattices. The Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory relates the lattice of subfields of an algebraic extension  $E$  of a field  $F$  to the subgroup structure of the group of automorphisms of  $E$  that send each element of  $F$  to itself. This relationship was discovered in the process of attempting to solve a polynomial equation  $f(x) = 0$  by radicals.

Before we can give a precise statement of the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, we need some terminology and notation.

# Definitions Automorphism, Galois Group, Fixed Field of  $H$

Let  $E$  be an extension field of the field  $F$ . An automorphism of  $E$  is a ring isomorphism from  $E$  onto  $E$ . The Galois group of  $E$  over  $F$ ,  $\operatorname{Gal}(E / F)$ , is the set of all automorphisms of  $E$  that take every element of  $F$  to itself. If  $H$  is a subgroup of  $\operatorname{Gal}(E / F)$ , the set

$$
E _ {H} = \{x \in E \mid \phi (x) = x \text {f o r a l l} \phi \in H \}
$$

is called the fixed field of  $H$ .

It is easy to show that the set of automorphisms of  $E$  forms a group under composition. We leave as exercises (Exercises 3 and 5) the verifications that the automorphism group of  $E$  fixing  $F$  is a subgroup of the automorphism group of  $E$  and that, for any subgroup  $H$  of  $\operatorname{Gal}(E / F)$ , the fixed field  $E_H$  of  $H$  is a subfield of  $E$ . Be careful not to misinterpret  $\operatorname{Gal}(E / F)$  as something that has to do with factor rings or factor groups. It does not.

The following examples will help you assimilate these definitions. In each example, we simply indicate how the automorphisms are defined. We leave to the reader the verifications that the mappings are indeed automorphisms.

EXAMPLE 1 Consider the extension  $Q(\sqrt{2})$  of  $Q$ . Since

$$
Q (\sqrt {2}) = \left\{a + b \sqrt {2} \mid a, b \in Q \right\}
$$

and any automorphism of a field containing  $Q$  must act as the identity on  $Q$  (Exercise 1), an automorphism  $\phi$  of  $Q(\sqrt{2})$  is completely determined by  $\phi(\sqrt{2})$ . Thus,

$$
2 = \phi (2) = \phi (\sqrt {2} \sqrt {2}) = (\phi (\sqrt {2})) ^ {2},
$$

and therefore  $\phi (\sqrt{2}) = \pm \sqrt{2}$ . This proves that the group  $\operatorname {Gal}(Q(\sqrt{2}) / Q)$  has two elements, the identity mapping and the mapping that sends  $a + b\sqrt{2}$  to  $a - b\sqrt{2}$ .

EXAMPLE 2 Consider the extension  $Q(\sqrt[3]{2})$  of  $Q$ . An automorphism  $\phi$  of  $Q(\sqrt[3]{2})$  is completely determined by  $\phi(\sqrt[3]{2})$ . By an argument analogous to that in Example 1, we see that  $\phi(\sqrt[3]{2})$  must be a cube root of 2. Since  $Q(\sqrt[3]{2})$  is a subset of the real numbers and  $\sqrt[3]{2}$  is the only real cube root of 2, we must have  $\phi(\sqrt[3]{2}) = \sqrt[3]{2}$ . Thus,  $\phi$  is the identity automorphism and  $\operatorname{Gal}(Q(\sqrt[3]{2}) / Q)$  has only one element. Obviously, the fixed field of  $\operatorname{Gal}(Q\sqrt[3]{2} / Q)$  is  $Q(\sqrt[3]{2})$ .

EXAMPLE 3 Consider the extension  $Q(\sqrt[4]{2}, i)$  of  $Q(i)$ . Any automorphism  $\phi$  of  $Q(\sqrt[4]{2}, i)$  fixing  $Q(i)$  is completely determined by  $\phi(\sqrt[4]{2})$ . Since

$$
2 = \phi (2) = \phi ((\sqrt [ 4 ]{2}) ^ {4}) = (\phi (\sqrt [ 4 ]{2})) ^ {4},
$$

we see that  $\phi(\sqrt[4]{2})$  must be a fourth root of 2. Thus, there are at most four possible automorphisms of  $Q(\sqrt[4]{2}, i)$  fixing  $Q(i)$ . If we define an automorphism  $\alpha$  such that  $\alpha(i) = i$  and  $\alpha(\sqrt[4]{2}) = i\sqrt[4]{2}$ , then  $\alpha \in \operatorname{Gal}(Q(\sqrt[4]{2}, i)/Q(i))$  and  $\alpha$  has order 4. Thus,  $\operatorname{Gal}(Q(\sqrt[4]{2}, i)/Q(i))$  is a cyclic group of order 4. The fixed field of  $\{\varepsilon, \alpha^2\}$  (where  $\varepsilon$  is the identity automorphism) is  $Q(\sqrt{2}, i)$ . The lattice of subgroups of  $\operatorname{Gal}(Q(\sqrt[4]{2}, i)/Q(i))$  and the lattice of subfields of  $Q(\sqrt[4]{2}, i)$  containing  $Q(i)$  are shown in Figure 30.3. As in Figures 30.1 and 30.2, the integers along the lines of the group lattice represent the index of a subgroup in the group above it, and the integers along the lines of the field lattice represent the degree of the extension of a field over the field below it.

EXAMPLE 4 Consider the extension  $Q(\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{5})$  of  $Q$ . Since

$$
Q (\sqrt {3}, \sqrt {5}) = \left\{a + b \sqrt {3} + c \sqrt {5} + d \sqrt {3} \sqrt {5} \mid a, b, c, d \in Q \right\},
$$

any automorphism  $\phi$  of  $Q(\sqrt{3},\sqrt{5})$  is completely determined by the two values  $\phi (\sqrt{3})$  and  $\phi (\sqrt{5})$ . This time there are four automorphisms.

Figure 30.3 Lattice of subgroups of Gal  $(Q(\sqrt[4]{2},i) / Q(i))$  and lattice of subfields of  $Q(\sqrt[4]{2},i)$  containing  $Q(i)$ .

Obviously,  $\operatorname{Gal}(Q(\sqrt{3},\sqrt{5}) / Q)$  is isomorphic to  $Z_{2}\oplus Z_{2}$ . The fixed field of  $\{\varepsilon ,\alpha \}$  is  $Q(\sqrt{5})$ , the fixed field of  $\{\varepsilon ,\beta \}$  is  $Q(\sqrt{3})$ , and the fixed field of  $\{\varepsilon ,\alpha \beta \}$  is  $Q(\sqrt{3}\sqrt{5})$ . The lattice of subgroups of  $\operatorname{Gal}(Q(\sqrt{3},\sqrt{5}) / Q)$  and the lattice of subfields of  $Q(\sqrt{3},\sqrt{5})$  are shown in Figure 30.4.

Example 5 is a bit more complicated than our previous examples. In particular, the automorphism group is non-Abelian.

EXAMPLE 5 Direct calculations show that  $\omega = -1/2 + i\sqrt{3}/2$  satisfies the equations  $\omega^3 = 1$  and  $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0$ . Now, consider the extension  $Q(\omega, \sqrt[3]{2})$  of  $Q$ . We may describe the automorphisms of  $Q(\omega, \sqrt[3]{2})$  by specifying how they act on  $\omega$  and  $\sqrt[3]{2}$ . There are six in all.

<table><tr><td>ε</td><td>α</td><td>β</td><td>β2</td><td>αβ</td><td>αβ2</td></tr><tr><td>ω→ω</td><td>ω→ω2</td><td>ω→ω</td><td>ω→ω</td><td>ω→ω2</td><td>ω→ω2</td></tr><tr><td>√3/2→√3/2</td><td>√3/2→√3/2</td><td>√3/2→ω√3/2</td><td>√3/2→ω2√3/2</td><td>√3/2→ω2√3/2</td><td>√3/2→ω3√2</td></tr></table>

Since  $\alpha \beta \neq \beta \alpha$ , we know that  $\operatorname{Gal}(Q(\omega, \sqrt[3]{2}) / Q)$  is isomorphic to  $S_3$ . (See Theorem 7.2.) The lattices of subgroups and subfields are shown in Figure 30.5.

The lattices in Figure 30.5 have been arranged so that each nontrivial proper field occupying the same position as some group is the fixed field of that group. For instance,  $Q(\omega \sqrt[3]{2})$  is the fixed field of  $\{\varepsilon, \alpha \beta\}$ .

Figure 30.5 Lattice of subgroups of  $\operatorname{Gal}(Q(\omega, \sqrt[3]{2}) / Q)$  and lattice of subfields of  $Q(\omega, \sqrt[3]{2})$ , where  $\omega = -1/2 + i\sqrt{3}/2$ .

The preceding examples show that, in certain cases, there is an intimate connection between the lattice of subfields between  $E$  and  $F$  and the lattice of subgroups of  $\operatorname{Gal}(E / F)$ . In general, if  $E$  is an extension of  $F$ , and we let  $\mathcal{F}$  be the lattice of subfields of  $E$  containing  $F$  and let  $\mathcal{G}$  be the lattice of subgroups of  $\operatorname{Gal}(E / F)$ , then for each  $K$  in  $\mathcal{F}$ , the group  $\operatorname{Gal}(E / K)$  is in  $\mathcal{G}$ , and for each  $H$  in  $\mathcal{G}$ , the field  $E_H$  is in  $\mathcal{F}$ . Thus, we may define a mapping  $g: \mathcal{F} \to \mathcal{G}$  by  $g(K) = \operatorname{Gal}(E / K)$  and a mapping  $f: \mathcal{G} \to \mathcal{F}$  by  $f(H) = E_H$ . It is easy to show that if  $K$  and  $L$  belong to  $\mathcal{F}$  and  $K \subseteq L$ , then  $g(K) \supseteq g(L)$ . Similarly, if  $G$  and  $H$  belong to  $\mathcal{G}$  and  $G \subseteq H$ , then  $f(G) \supseteq f(H)$ . Thus,  $f$  and  $g$  are inclusion-reversing mappings between  $\mathcal{F}$  and  $\mathcal{G}$ . We leave it to the reader to show that for any  $K$  in  $\mathcal{F}$ , we have  $(fg)(K) \supseteq K$ , and for any  $G$  in  $\mathcal{G}$ , we have  $(gf)(G) \supseteq G$ . When  $E$  is an arbitrary extension of  $F$ , these inclusions may be strict. However, when  $E$  is a suitably chosen extension of  $F$ , the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, Theorem 30.1, says that  $f$  and  $g$  are inverses of each other, so that the inclusions are equalities. In particular,  $f$  and  $g$  are inclusion-reversing isomorphisms between the lattices  $\mathcal{F}$  and  $\mathcal{G}$ . A stronger result than that given in Theorem 30.1 is true, but our theorem illustrates the fundamental principles involved.

# Theorem 30.1 Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory

Let  $F$  be a field of characteristic 0 or a finite field. If  $E$  is the splitting field over  $F$  for some polynomial in  $F[x]$ , then the mapping from the set of subfields of  $E$  containing  $F$  to the set of subgroups of  $\operatorname{Gal}(E / F)$  given by  $K \to \operatorname{Gal}(E / K)$  is a one-

to-one correspondence. Furthermore, for any subfield  $K$  of  $E$  containing  $F$ ,

1.  $[E:K] = |\operatorname{Gal}(E/K)|$  and  $[K:F] = |\operatorname{Gal}(E/F)|/\| \operatorname{Gal}(E/K)\|$ . [The index of  $\operatorname{Gal}(E/K)$  in  $\operatorname{Gal}(E/F)$  equals the degree of  $K$  over  $F$ .]  
2. If  $K$  is the splitting field of some polynomial in  $F[x]$ , then  $\operatorname{Gal}(E / K)$  is a normal subgroup of  $\operatorname{Gal}(E / F)$  and  $\operatorname{Gal}(K / F)$  is isomorphic to  $\operatorname{Gal}(E / F) / \operatorname{Gal}(E / K)$ .  
3.  $K = E_{\operatorname{Gal}(E / K)}$ . [The fixed field of  $\operatorname{Gal}(E / K)$  is  $K$ .]  
4. If  $H$  is a subgroup of  $\operatorname{Gal}(E / F)$ , then  $H = \operatorname{Gal}(E / E_H)$ . [The automorphism group of  $E$  fixing  $E_H$  is  $H$ .]

Generally speaking, it is much easier to determine a lattice of subgroups than a lattice of subfields. For example, it is usually quite difficult to determine, directly, how many subfields a given field has, and it is often difficult to decide whether or not two extensions are the same. The corresponding questions about groups are much more tractable. Hence, the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory can be a great labor-saving device. Here is an illustration. [Recall from Chapter 19 that if  $f(x) \in F[x]$  and the zeros of  $f(x)$  in some extension of  $F$  are  $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ , then  $F(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)$  is the splitting field of  $f(x)$  over  $F$ .]

EXAMPLE 6 Let  $\omega = \cos(2\pi/7) + i\sin(2\pi/7)$ , so that  $\omega^7 = 1$ , and consider the field  $Q(\omega)$ . How many subfields does it have and what are they? First, observe that  $Q(\omega)$  is the splitting field of  $x^7 - 1$  over  $Q$ , so that we may apply the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory. A simple calculation shows that the automorphism  $\phi$  that sends  $\omega$  to  $\omega^3$  has order 6. Thus,

$$
[ Q (\omega): Q ] = | \operatorname {G a l} (Q (\omega) / Q) | \geq 6.
$$

Also, since

$$
x ^ {7} - 1 = (x - 1) \left(x ^ {6} + x ^ {5} + x ^ {4} + x ^ {3} + x ^ {2} + x + 1\right)
$$

and  $\omega$  is a zero of  $x^7 - 1$ , we see that

$$
| \operatorname {G a l} (Q (\omega) / Q) | = [ Q (\omega): Q ] \leq 6.
$$

Thus,  $\operatorname{Gal}(Q(\omega) / Q)$  is a cyclic group of order 6. So, the lattice of subgroups of  $\operatorname{Gal}(Q(\omega) / Q)$  is trivial to compute. See Figure 30.6.

This means that  $Q(\omega)$  contains exactly two proper extensions of  $Q$ : one of degree 3 corresponding to the fixed field of  $\langle \phi^3 \rangle$  and one of degree 2 corresponding to the fixed field of  $\langle \phi^2 \rangle$ . To find the fixed field of  $\langle \phi^3 \rangle$ , we must find a member of  $Q(\omega)$  that is not in  $Q$  and that is fixed by  $\phi^3$ . Experimenting with various possibilities leads us to discover that  $\omega + \omega^{-1}$  is fixed by  $\phi^3$  (see Exercise 9), and it follows that  $Q \subset Q(\omega + \omega^{-1}) \subseteq Q(\omega)_{\langle \phi^3 \rangle}$ . Since  $[Q(\omega)_{\langle \phi^3 \rangle}: Q] = 3$  and  $[Q(\omega + \omega^{-1}): Q]$  divides  $[Q(\omega)_{\langle \phi^3 \rangle}: Q]$ , we see that

![](images/02ca6a8610d322788ed21b02c0fdc5b71bb8bead7db47f9a795b472edc88344a.jpg)  
Figure 30.6 Lattice of subgroups of  $\operatorname{Gal}(Q(\omega) / Q)$ , where  $\omega = \cos(2\pi / 7) + i\sin(2\pi / 7)$ .

$Q(\omega + \omega^{-1}) = Q(\omega)_{\langle \phi^3 \rangle}$ . A similar argument shows that  $Q(\omega^3 + \omega^5 + \omega^6)$  is the fixed field of  $\langle \phi^2 \rangle$ . Thus, we have found all subfields of  $Q(\omega)$ .

EXAMPLE 7 Consider the extension  $E = \mathrm{GF}(p^n)$  of  $F = \mathrm{GF}(p)$ . Let us determine  $\operatorname{Gal}(E / F)$ . By Corollary 2 of Theorem 21.2,  $E$  has the form  $F(b)$  for some  $b$  where  $b$  is the zero of an irreducible polynomial  $p(x)$  of the form  $x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \dots + a_1x + a_0$ , where  $a_{n-1}, a_{n-2}, \ldots, a_0$  belong to  $F$ . Since any field automorphism  $\phi$  of  $E$  must take 1 to itself, it follows that  $\phi$  acts as the identity on  $F$ . Thus,  $p(b) = 0$  implies that  $p(\phi(b)) = 0$ . And because  $p(x)$  has at most  $n$  zeros, we know that there are at most  $n$  possibilities for  $\phi(b)$ . On the other hand, by Exercise 49 in Chapter 13, we know that the mapping  $\sigma(a) = a^p$  for all  $a \in E$  is an automorphism of  $E$ , and it follows from the fact that  $E^*$  is cyclic (Theorem 21.2) that the group  $\langle \sigma \rangle$  has order  $n$  (see Exercise 9 in Chapter 21). Thus,  $\operatorname{Gal}(\operatorname{GF}(p^n) / \operatorname{GF}(p)) \approx Z_n$ .

# Solvability of Polynomials by Radicals

For Galois, the elegant correspondence between groups and fields given by Theorem 30.1 was only a means to an end. Galois sought to solve a problem that had stymied mathematicians for centuries. Methods for solving linear and quadratic equations were known thousands of years ago (the quadratic formula). In the 16th century, Italian mathematicians developed formulas for solving any third- or fourth-degree equation. Their formulas involved only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and extraction of roots (radicals). For example, the equation

$$
x ^ {3} + b x + c = 0
$$

has the three solutions

$$
\begin{array}{l} A + B, \\ - (A + B) / 2 + (A - B) \sqrt {- 3} / 2, \\ - (A + B) / 2 - (A - B) \sqrt {- 3} / 2, \\ \end{array}
$$

where

$$
A = \sqrt [ 3 ]{\frac {- c}{2} + \sqrt {\frac {b ^ {3}}{2 7} + \frac {c ^ {2}}{4}}} \quad \text {a n d} \quad B = \sqrt [ 3 ]{\frac {- c}{2} - \sqrt {\frac {b ^ {3}}{2 7} + \frac {c ^ {2}}{4}}}.
$$

The formulas for the general cubic  $x^{3} + ax^{2} + bx + c = 0$  and the general quartic (fourth-degree polynomial) are even more complicated, but nevertheless can be given in terms of radicals of rational expressions of the coefficients.

Both Abel and Galois proved that there is no general solution of a fifth-degree equation by radicals. In particular, there is no "quintic formula." Before discussing Galois's method, which provided a group theoretic criterion for the solution of an equation by radicals and led to the modern-day Galois theory, we need a few definitions.

# Definition Solvable by Radicals

Let  $F$  be a field, and let  $f(x) \in F[x]$ . We say that  $f(x)$  is solvable by radicals over  $F$  if  $f(x)$  splits in some extension  $F(a_{1},a_{2},\ldots ,a_{n})$  of  $F$  and there exist positive integers  $k_{1},\ldots ,k_{n}$  such that  $a_1^{k_1} \in F$  and  $a_i^{k_i} \in F(a_1,\dots ,a_{i - 1})$  for  $i = 2,\ldots ,n$ .

So, a polynomial in  $F[x]$  is solvable by radicals if we can obtain all of its zeros by adjoining  $k$ th roots (for various  $k$ ) to  $F$ . In other words, each zero of the polynomial can be written as an expression (usually a messy one) involving elements of  $F$  combined by the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and extraction of roots.

EXAMPLE 8 Let  $\omega = \cos(2\pi/8) + i\sin(2\pi/8) = \sqrt{2}/2 + i\sqrt{2}/2$ . Then  $x^8 - 3$  splits in  $Q(\omega, \sqrt[8]{3}), \omega^8 \in Q$ , and  $(\sqrt[8]{3})^8 \in Q \subset Q(\omega)$ . Thus,  $x^8 - 3$  is solvable by radicals over  $Q$ . Although the zeros of  $x^8 - 3$  are most conveniently written in the form  $\sqrt[8]{3}, \sqrt[8]{3}\omega, \sqrt[8]{3}\omega^2, \ldots, \sqrt[8]{3}\omega^7$ , the notion of solvable by radicals is best illustrated by writing them in the form

$$
\begin{array}{l} \pm \sqrt [ 8 ]{3}, \pm \sqrt {- 1} \sqrt [ 8 ]{3}, \pm \sqrt [ 8 ]{3} \left(\frac {\sqrt {2}}{2} + \frac {\sqrt {- 1} \sqrt {2}}{2}\right), \\ \pm \sqrt [ s ]{3} \left(\frac {\sqrt {2}}{2} - \frac {\sqrt {- 1} \sqrt {2}}{2}\right). \\ \end{array}
$$

Thus, the problem of solving a polynomial equation for its zeros can be transformed into a problem about field extensions. At the same time, we can use the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory to transform a problem about field extensions into a problem about groups. This is exactly how Galois showed that there are fifth-degree polynomials that cannot be solved by radicals, and this is exactly how we will do it. Before giving an example of such a polynomial, we need some additional group theory.

# Definition Solvable Group

We say that a group  $G$  is solvable if  $G$  has a series of subgroups

$$
\{e \} = H _ {0} \subset H _ {1} \subset H _ {2} \subset \dots \subset H _ {k} = G,
$$

where, for each  $0 \leq i < k$ ,  $H_{i}$  is normal in  $H_{i+1}$  and  $H_{i+1} / H_{i}$  is Abelian.

Obviously, Abelian groups are solvable. So are the dihedral groups and any group whose order has the form  $p^n$ , where  $p$  is a prime (see Exercises 28 and 29). The monumental Feit-Thompson Theorem (see Chapter 24) says that every group of odd order is solvable. In a certain sense, solvable groups are almost Abelian. On the other hand, it follows directly from the definitions that any non-Abelian simple group is not solvable. In particular,  $A_5$  is not solvable. It follows from Exercise 21 in Chapter 24 that  $S_5$  is not solvable. Our goal is to connect the notion of solvability of polynomials by radicals to that of solvable groups. The next theorem is a step in this direction.

# Theorem 30.2 Condition for  $\operatorname{Gal}(E / F)$  to be Solvable

Let  $F$  be a field of characteristic 0 and let  $a \in F$ . If  $E$  is the splitting field of  $x^n - a$  over  $F$ , then the Galois group  $\operatorname{Gal}(E / F)$  is solvable.

PROOF We first handle the case where  $F$  contains a primitive  $n$ th root of unity  $\omega$ . Let  $b$  be a zero of  $x^n - a$  in  $E$ . Then the zeros of  $x^n - a$  are  $b, \omega b, \omega^2 b, \ldots, \omega^{n-1} b$ , and therefore  $E = F(b)$ . In this case, we claim that  $\operatorname{Gal}(E / F)$  is Abelian and hence solvable. To see this, observe that any automorphism in  $\operatorname{Gal}(E / F)$  is completely determined by its action on  $b$ . Also, since  $b$  is a zero of  $x^n - a$ , we know that any element of  $\operatorname{Gal}(E / F)$  sends  $b$  to another zero of  $x^n - a$ . That is, any element of  $\operatorname{Gal}(E / F)$  takes  $b$  to  $\omega^i b$  for some  $i$ . Let  $\phi$  and  $\sigma$  be two elements of  $\operatorname{Gal}(E / F)$ . Then, since  $\omega \in F$ ,  $\phi$  and  $\sigma$  fix  $\omega$  and  $\phi(b) = \omega^j b$  and  $\sigma(b) = \omega^k b$  for some  $j$  and  $k$ . Thus,

$$
(\sigma \phi) (b) = \sigma (\phi (b)) = \sigma \left(\omega^ {j} b\right) = \sigma \left(\omega^ {j}\right) \sigma (b) = \omega^ {j} \omega^ {k} b = \omega^ {j + k} b,
$$

whereas

$$
(\phi \sigma) (b) = \phi (\sigma (b)) = \phi \left(\omega^ {k} b\right) = \phi \left(\omega^ {k}\right) \phi (b) = \omega^ {k} \omega^ {j} b = \omega^ {k + j} b,
$$

so that  $\sigma \phi$  and  $\phi \sigma$  agree on  $b$  and fix the elements of  $F$ . This shows that  $\sigma \phi = \phi \sigma$ , and therefore  $\operatorname{Gal}(E / F)$  is Abelian.

Now suppose that  $F$  does not contain a primitive  $n$ th root of unity. Let  $\omega$  be a primitive  $n$ th root of unity and let  $b$  be a zero of  $x^n - a$  in  $E$ . The case where  $a = 0$  is trivial, so we may assume that  $b \neq 0$ . Since  $\omega b$  is also a zero of  $x^n - a$ , we know that both  $b$  and  $\omega b$  belong to  $E$ , and therefore  $\omega = \omega b / b$  is in  $E$  as well. Thus,  $F(\omega)$  is contained in  $E$ , and  $F(\omega)$  is the splitting field of  $x^n - 1$  over  $F$ . Analogous to the case above, for any automorphisms  $\phi$  and  $\sigma$  in  $\operatorname{Gal}(F(\omega) / F)$  we have  $\phi(\omega) = \omega^j$  for some  $j$  and  $\sigma(\omega) = \omega^k$  for some  $k$ . Then,

$$
\begin{array}{l} (\sigma \phi) (\omega) = \sigma (\phi (\omega)) = \sigma (\omega^ {j}) = (\sigma (\omega)) ^ {j} = (\omega^ {k}) ^ {j} \\ = (\omega^ {j}) ^ {k} = (\phi (\omega)) ^ {k} = \phi (\omega^ {k}) = \phi (\sigma (\omega)) = (\phi \sigma) (\omega). \\ \end{array}
$$

Since elements of  $\operatorname{Gal}(F(\omega) / F)$  are completely determined by their action on  $\omega$ , this shows that  $\operatorname{Gal}(F(\omega) / F)$  is Abelian.

Because  $E$  is the splitting field of  $x^n - a$  over  $F(\omega)$  and  $F(\omega)$  contains a primitive  $n$ th root of unity, we know from the case we have already done that  $\operatorname{Gal}(E / F(\omega))$  is Abelian and, by Part 2 of Theorem 30.1, the series

$$
\{e \} \subseteq \operatorname {G a l} (E / F (\omega)) \subseteq \operatorname {G a l} (E / F)
$$

is a normal series. Finally, since both  $\operatorname{Gal}(E / F(\omega))$  and

$$
\operatorname {G a l} (E / F) / \operatorname {G a l} (E / F (\omega)) \approx \operatorname {G a l} (F (\omega) / F)
$$

are Abelian,  $\operatorname {Gal}(E / F)$  is solvable.

To reach our main result about polynomials that are solvable by radicals, we need two important facts about solvable groups.

Theorem 30.3 Factor Group of a Solvable Group Is Solvable

A factor group of a solvable group is solvable.

PROOF Suppose that  $G$  has a series of subgroups

$$
\{e \} = H _ {0} \subset H _ {1} \subset H _ {2} \subset \dots \subset H _ {k} = G,
$$

where, for each  $0 \leq i < k$ ,  $H_{i}$  is normal in  $H_{i+1}$  and  $H_{i+1} / H_{i}$  is Abelian. If  $N$  is any normal subgroup of  $G$ , then

$$
\{e \} = H _ {0} N / N \subset H _ {1} N / N \subset H _ {2} N / N \subset \dots \subset H _ {k} N / N = G / N
$$

is the requisite series of subgroups that guarantees that  $G / N$  is solvable. (See Exercise 31.)

Theorem 30.4  $N$  and  $G / N$  Solvable implies  $G$  Is Solvable

Let  $N$  be a normal subgroup of a group  $G$ . If both  $N$  and  $G / N$  are solvable, then  $G$  is solvable.

PROOF Let a series of subgroups of  $N$  with Abelian factors be

$$
N _ {0} \subset N _ {1} \subset \dots \subset N _ {t} = N
$$

and let a series of subgroups of  $G / N$  with Abelian factors be

$$
N / N = H _ {0} / N \subset H _ {1} / N \subset \dots \subset H _ {s} / N = G / N.
$$

Then the series

$$
N _ {0} \subset N _ {1} \subset \dots \subset N _ {t} = H _ {0} \subset H _ {1} \subset \dots \subset H _ {s} = G
$$

has Abelian factors (see Exercise 33).

We are now able to make the critical connection between solvability of polynomials by radicals and solvable groups.

# Theorem 30.5 (Galois) Solvable by Radicals Implies Solvable Group

Let  $F$  be a field of characteristic 0 and let  $f(x) \in F[x]$ . Suppose that  $f(x)$  splits in  $F(a_{1},a_{2},\ldots ,a_{t})$ , where  $a_1^{n_1} \in F$  and  $a_i^{n_i} \in F(a_1,\dots ,a_{i - 1})$  for  $i = 2,\ldots ,t$ . Let  $E$  be the splitting field for  $f(x)$  over  $F$  in  $F(a_{1},a_{2},\ldots ,a_{t})$ . Then the Galois group  $\operatorname{Gal}(E / F)$  is solvable.

PROOF We use induction on  $t$ . For the case  $t = 1$ , we have  $F \subseteq E \subseteq F(a_{1})$ . Let  $a = a_{1}^{n_{1}}$  and let  $L$  be a splitting field of  $x^{n_1} - a$  over  $F$ . Then  $F \subseteq E \subseteq L$ , and both  $E$  and  $L$  are splitting fields of polynomials over  $F$ . By part 2 of Theorem 30.1,  $\operatorname{Gal}(E / F) \approx \operatorname{Gal}(L / F) / \operatorname{Gal}(L / E)$ . It follows from Theorem 30.2 that  $\operatorname{Gal}(L / F)$  is solvable, and from Theorem 30.3 we know that  $\operatorname{Gal}(L / F) / \operatorname{Gal}(L / E)$  is solvable. Thus,  $\operatorname{Gal}(E / F)$  is solvable.

Now suppose  $t > 1$ . Let  $a = a_1^{n_1} \in F$ , let  $L$  be a splitting field of  $x^{n_1} - a$  over  $E$ , and let  $K \subseteq L$  be the splitting field of  $x^{n_1} - a$  over  $F$ . Then  $L$  is a splitting field of  $(x^{n_1} - a)f(x)$  over  $F$ , and  $L$  is a splitting field of  $f(x)$  over  $K$ . Since  $F(a_1) \subseteq K$ , we know that  $f(x)$  splits in  $K(a_2, \ldots, a_t)$ , so the induction hypothesis implies that  $\operatorname{Gal}(L / K)$  is solvable. Also, Theorem 30.2 asserts that  $\operatorname{Gal}(K / F)$  is solvable, which, from Theorem 30.1, tells us that  $\operatorname{Gal}(L / F) / \operatorname{Gal}(L / K)$  is solvable. Hence, Theorem 30.4 implies that  $\operatorname{Gal}(L / F)$  is solvable. So, by part 2 of Theorem 30.1 and Theorem 30.3, we know that the factor group  $\operatorname{Gal}(L / F) / \operatorname{Gal}(L / E) \approx \operatorname{Gal}(E / F)$  is solvable.

It is worth remarking that the converse of Theorem 30.5 is true also; that is, if  $E$  is the splitting field of a polynomial  $f(x)$  over a field  $F$  of characteristic 0 and  $\operatorname{Gal}(E / F)$  is solvable, then  $f(x)$  is solvable by radicals over  $F$ .

It is known that every finite group is a Galois group over some field. However, one of the major unsolved problems in algebra, first posed by Emmy Noether, is determining which finite groups can occur as Galois groups over  $Q$ . Many people suspect that the answer is "all of them." It is known that every solvable group is a Galois group over  $Q$ . John Thompson proved that certain kinds of simple groups, including the Monster, are Galois groups over  $Q$ .

# Insolvability of a Quintic

We will finish our introduction to Galois theory by explicitly exhibiting a polynomial that has integer coefficients and that is not solvable by radicals over  $Q$ .

Consider  $g(x) = 3x^{5} - 15x + 5$ . By Eisenstein's Criterion (Theorem 17.4),  $g(x)$  is irreducible over  $Q$ . Since  $g(x)$  is continuous and  $g(-2) = -61$  and  $g(-1) = 17$ , we know that  $g(x)$  has a real zero between  $-2$  and  $-1$ . A similar analysis shows that  $g(x)$  also has real zeros between 0 and 1 and between 1 and 2.

Each of these real zeros has multiplicity 1, as can be verified by long division or by appealing to Theorem 19.6. Furthermore,  $g(x)$  has no more than three real zeros, because Rolle's Theorem from calculus guarantees that

between each pair of real zeros of  $g(x)$  there must be a zero of  $g'(x) = 15x^4 - 15$ . So, for  $g(x)$  to have four real zeros,  $g'(x)$  would have to have three real zeros, and it does not. Thus, the other two zeros of  $g(x)$  are nonreal complex numbers, say,  $a + bi$  and  $a + bi$ . (See Exercise 73 in Chapter 15.)

Now, let's denote the five zeros of  $g(x)$  by  $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5$ . Since any automorphism of  $K = Q(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5)$  is completely determined by its action on the  $a$ 's and must permute the  $a$ 's, we know that  $\operatorname{Gal}(K / Q)$  is isomorphic to a subgroup of  $S_5$ , the symmetric group on five symbols. Since  $a_1$  is a zero of an irreducible polynomial of degree 5 over  $Q$ , we know that  $[Q(a_1):Q] = 5$ , and therefore 5 divides  $[K:Q]$ . Thus, the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory tells us that 5 also divides  $|\operatorname{Gal}(K / Q)|$ . So, by Cauchy's Theorem (corollary to Theorem 24.3), we may conclude that  $\operatorname{Gal}(K / Q)$  has an element of order 5. Since the only elements in  $S_5$  of order 5 are the 5-cycles, we know that  $\operatorname{Gal}(K / Q)$  contains a 5-cycle. The mapping from  $\mathbf{C}$  to  $\mathbf{C}$ , sending  $a + bi$  to  $a - bi$ , is also an element of  $\operatorname{Gal}(K / Q)$ . Since this mapping fixes the three real zeros and interchanges the two complex zeros of  $g(x)$ , we know that  $\operatorname{Gal}(K / Q)$  contains a 2-cycle. But, the only subgroup of  $S_5$  that contains both a 5-cycle and a 2-cycle is  $S_5$ . (See Exercise 25 in Chapter 24.) So,  $\operatorname{Gal}(K / Q)$  is isomorphic to  $S_5$ . Finally, since  $S_5$  is not solvable (see Exercise 27), we have succeeded in exhibiting a fifth-degree polynomial that is not solvable by radicals.

# Cyclotomic Extensions

"... To regard old problems from a new angle requires creative imagination and marks real advances in science."

Albert Einstein

Innovation is taking two things that already exist and putting them together in a new way.

Tom Freston

# Motivation

For the culminating chapter of this book, it is fitting to choose a topic that ties together results about groups, rings, fields, geometric constructions, and the history of mathematics. The so-called cyclotomic extensions is such a topic. We begin with the history.

The ancient Greeks knew how to construct regular polygons of 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, and 16 sides with a straightedge and compass. And, given a construction of a regular  $n$ -gon, it is easy to construct a regular  $2n$ -gon. The Greeks attempted to fill in the gaps (7, 9, 11, 13, 14, 17, . . .) but failed. More than 2200 years passed before anyone was able to advance our knowledge of this problem beyond that of the Greeks. Incredibly, Gauss, at age 19, showed that a regular 17-gon is constructible, and shortly thereafter he completely solved the problem of exactly which  $n$ -gons are constructible. It was this discovery of the 17-sided regular polygon that induced Gauss to dedicate his life to the study of mathematics. Gauss was so proud of this accomplishment that he requested that a regular 17-sided polygon be engraved on his tombstone.

Gauss was led to his discovery of the constructible polygons through his investigation of the factorization of polynomials of the form  $x^n - 1$  over  $Q$ . In this chapter, we examine the factors of  $x^n - 1$  and show how Galois theory can be used to determine which regular  $n$ -gons are constructible with a straightedge and compass. The irreducible factors of  $x^n - 1$  are important in number theory and combinatorics.

# Cyclotomic Polynomials

Recall from Example 2 in Chapter 16 that the complex zeros of  $x^n - 1$  are  $1, \omega = \cos(2\pi / n) + i\sin(2\pi / n), \omega^2, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{n-1}$ . Thus, the splitting field of  $x^n - 1$  over  $Q$  is  $Q(\omega)$ . This field is called the  $n$ th cyclotomic extension of  $Q$ , and the irreducible factors of  $x^n - 1$  over  $Q$  are called the cyclotomic polynomials.

Since  $\omega = \cos(2\pi / n) + i\sin(2\pi / n)$  generates a cyclic group of order  $n$  under multiplication, we know from Corollary 3 of Theorem 4.2 that the generators of  $\langle \omega \rangle$  are the elements of the form  $\omega^k$ , where  $1 \leq k \leq n$  and  $\gcd(n, k) = 1$ . These generators are called the primitive  $n$ th roots of unity. recalling that we use  $\phi(n)$  to denote the number of positive integers less than or equal to  $n$  and relatively prime to  $n$ , we see that for each positive integer  $n$  there are precisely  $\phi(n)$  primitive  $n$ th roots of unity. The polynomials whose zeros are the  $\phi(n)$  primitive  $n$ th roots of unity have a special name.

# Definition Cyclotomic Polynomial

For any positive integer  $n$ , let  $\omega_1, \omega_2, \ldots, \omega_{\phi(n)}$  denote the primitive  $n$ th roots of unity. The  $n$ th cyclotomic polynomial over  $Q$  is the polynomial  $\Phi_n(x) = (x - \omega_1)(x - \omega_2) \cdots (x - \omega_{\phi(n)})$ .

In particular, note that  $\Phi_n(x)$  is monic and has degree  $\phi(n)$ . In Theorem 31.2 we will prove that  $\Phi_n(x)$  has integer coefficients, and in Theorem 31.3 we will prove that  $\Phi_n(x)$  is irreducible over  $Z$ .

EXAMPLE 1  $\Phi_1(x) = x - 1$ , since 1 is the only zero of  $x - 1$ .  $\Phi_2(x) = x + 1$ , since the zeros of  $x^2 - 1$  are 1 and  $-1$ , and  $-1$  is the only primitive root.  $\Phi_3(x) = (x - \omega)(x - \omega^2)$ , where  $\omega = \cos(2\pi/3) + i\sin(2\pi/3) = (-1 + i\sqrt{3}/2)$  and direct calculations show that  $\Phi_3(x) = x^2 + x + 1$ . Since the zeros of  $x^4 - 1$  are  $\pm 1$  and  $\pm i$  and only  $i$  and  $-i$  are primitive,  $\Phi_4(x) = (x - i)(x + i) = x^2 + 1$ .

In practice, one does not use the definition of  $\Phi_n(x)$  to compute it. Instead, one uses the formulas given in the exercises and makes recursive use of the following result.

# Theorem 31.1  $x^n -1 = \prod_{d / n}\Phi_d(x)$

For every positive integer  $n$ ,  $x^n - 1 = \prod_{d \mid n} \Phi_d(x)$ , where the product runs over all positive divisors  $d$  of  $n$ .

Before proving this theorem, let us be sure that the statement is clear. For  $n = 6$ , for instance, the theorem asserts that  $x^6 - 1 = \Phi_1(x)\Phi_2(x)\Phi_3(x)\Phi_6(x)$ , since 1, 2, 3, and 6 are the positive divisors of 6.

PROOF Since both polynomials in the statement are monic, it suffices to show that they have the same zeros and that all zeros have multiplicity 1. Let  $\omega = \cos(2\pi / n) + i\sin(2\pi / n)$ . Then  $\langle \omega \rangle$  is a cyclic group of order  $n$ , and  $\langle \omega \rangle$  contains all the  $n$ th roots of unity. From Theorem 4.3 we know that for each  $j$ ,  $|\omega^j|$  divides  $n$  so that  $(x - \omega^j)$  appears as a factor in  $\Phi_{|\omega^j|}(x)$ . On the other hand, if  $x - \alpha$  is a linear factor of  $\Phi_d(x)$  for some divisor  $d$  of  $n$ , then  $\alpha^d = 1$ , and therefore  $\alpha^n = 1$ . Thus,  $x - \alpha$  is a factor of  $x^n - 1$ . Finally, since no zero of  $x^n - 1$  can be a zero of  $\Phi_d(x)$  for two different  $d$ 's, the result is proved.

Before we illustrate how Theorem 31.1 can be used to calculate  $\Phi_n(x)$  recursively, we state an important consequence of the theorem.

# Theorem 31.2  $\Phi_d(x)$  has Integer Coefficients

# For every positive integer  $n$ ,  $\Phi_n(x)$  has integer coefficients.

PROOF The case  $n = 1$  is trivial. By induction, we may assume that  $g(x) = \prod_{d < n^{d|n}} \Phi_d(x)$  has integer coefficients. From Theorem 31.1 we know that  $x^n - 1 = \Phi_n(x)g(x)$ , and, because  $g(x)$  is monic, we may carry out the division in  $Z[x]$  (see Exercise 71 in Chapter 16). Thus,  $\Phi_n(x) \in Z[x]$ .

Now let us do some calculations. If  $p$  is a prime, we have from Theorem 31.1 that  $x^p - 1 = \Phi_1(x)\Phi_p(x) = (x - 1)\Phi_p(x)$ , so that  $\Phi_p(x) = (x^p - 1) / (x - 1) = x^{p - 1} + x^{p - 2} + \dots + x + 1$ . From Theorem 31.1 we have

$$
x ^ {6} - 1 = \Phi_ {1} (x) \Phi_ {2} (x) \Phi_ {3} (x) \Phi_ {6} (x),
$$

so that  $\Phi_6(x) = (x^6 - 1) / ((x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + x + 1))$ . So, by long division  $\Phi_6(x) = x^2 - x + 1$ . Similarly,  $\Phi_{10}(x) = (x^{10} - 1) / ((x - 1)(x + 1)(x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1)) = x^4 - x^3 + x^2 - x + 1$ .

The exercises provide shortcuts that often make long division unnecessary. The values of  $\Phi_n(x)$  for all  $n$  up to 15 are shown in Table 31.1. The software for the computer exercises provides the values for  $\Phi_n(x)$  for all values of  $n$  up to 1000. Judging from Table 31.1, one might be led to conjecture that 1 and  $-1$  are the only nonzero coefficients of the cyclotomic polynomials. However, it has been shown that every integer is a coefficient of some cyclotomic polynomial.

The next theorem reveals why the cyclotomic polynomials are important.

# Theorem 31.3 (Gauss)  $\Phi_d(x)$  is Irreducible Over  $Z$

# The cyclotomic polynomials  $\Phi_n(x)$  are irreducible over  $Z$ .

PROOF Let  $f(x) \in Z[x]$  be a monic irreducible factor of  $\Phi_n(x)$ . Because  $\Phi_n(x)$  is monic and has no multiple zeros, it suffices to show that every zero of  $\Phi_n(x)$  is a zero of  $f(x)$ .

Since  $\Phi_n(x)$  divides  $x^n - 1$  in  $Z[x]$ , we may write  $x^n - 1 = f(x)g(x)$ , where  $g(x) \in Z[x]$ . Let  $\omega$  be a primitive  $n$ th root of unity that is a zero of  $f(x)$ . Then  $f(x)$  is the minimal polynomial for  $\omega$  over  $Q$ . Let  $p$  be any prime that does not divide  $n$ . Then, by Corollary 3 of Theorem 4.2,  $\omega^p$  is also a primitive  $n$ th root of unity, and therefore  $0 = (\omega^p)^n - 1 = f(\omega^p)g(\omega^p)$ , and so  $f(\omega^p) = 0$  or  $g(\omega^p) = 0$ . Suppose  $f(\omega^p) \neq 0$ . Then  $g(\omega^p) = 0$ , and so  $\omega$  is a zero of  $g(x^p)$ . Thus, from Theorem 21.3,  $f(x)$  divides  $g(x^p)$  in  $Q[x]$ . Since  $f(x)$  is monic,  $f(x)$  actually divides  $g(x^p)$  in  $Z[x]$  (see Exercise 71 in Chapter 16). Say  $g(x^p) = f(x)h(x)$ , where  $h(x) \in Z[x]$ . Now let  $\overline{g}(x), \overline{f}(x)$ , and  $\overline{h}(x)$  denote the polynomials in  $Z_p[x]$  obtained from  $g(x), f(x)$ , and  $h(x)$ , respectively, by reducing each coefficient modulo  $p$ . From Exercise 13 in Chapter 16 and Corollary 5 of Theorem 7.1, we then have  $(\overline{g}(x))^p = \overline{g}(x^p) = \overline{f}(x)\overline{h}(x)$ , and since  $Z_p[x]$  is a unique factorization domain, it follows that  $\overline{g}(x)$  and  $\overline{f}(x)$  have an irreducible factor in  $Z_p[x]$  in common; call it  $m(x)$ . Thus, we may write  $\overline{f}(x) = k_1(x)m(x)$  and  $\overline{g}(x) = k_2(x)m(x)$ , where  $k_1(x), k_2(x) \in Z_p[x]$ . Then, viewing  $x^n - 1$  as a member of  $Z_p[x]$ , we have  $x^n - 1 = \overline{f}(x)\overline{g}(x) = k_1(x)k_2(x)(m(x))^2$ . In particular,  $x^n - 1$  has a multiple zero in some extension of  $Z_p$ . But because  $p$  does not divide  $n$ , the derivative  $nx^{n-1}$  or  $x^n - 1$  is not 0, and so  $nx^{n-1}$  and  $x^n - 1$  do not have a common factor of positive degree in  $Z_p[x]$ . Since this contradicts Theorem 19.5, we must have  $f(\omega^p) = 0$ .

We reformulate what we have thus far proved as follows: If  $\beta$  is any primitive  $n$ th root of unity that is a zero of  $f(x)$  and  $p$  is any prime that does not divide  $n$ , then  $\beta^p$  is a zero of  $f(x)$ . Now let  $k$  be any integer between 1 and  $n$  that is relatively prime to  $n$ . Then we can write  $k = p_1p_2\cdots p_t$ , where each  $p_i$  is a prime that does not divide  $n$  (repetitions are permitted). It follows then that each of  $\omega, \omega^{p_1}, (\omega^{p_1})^{p_2}, \ldots, (\omega^{p_1p_2\cdots p_{t-1}})^{p_t} = \omega^k$  is a zero of  $f(x)$ . Since every zero of  $\Phi_n(x)$  has the form  $\omega^k$ , where  $k$  is between 1 and  $n$  and is relatively prime to  $n$ , we have proved that every zero of  $\Phi_n(n)$  is a zero of  $f(x)$ . This completes the proof.

Of course, Theorems 31.3 and 31.1 give us the factorization of  $x^n - 1$  as a product of irreducible polynomials over  $Q$ . But Theorem 31.1 is also useful for finding the irreducible factorization of  $x^n - 1$  over  $Z_p$ . The next example provides an illustration. Irreducible factors of  $x^n - 1$  over  $Z_p$  are used to construct error-correcting codes.

EXAMPLE 2 We determine the irreducible factorization of  $x^6 - 1$  over  $Z_2$  and  $Z_3$ . From Table 31.1, we have  $x^6 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + x + 1)(x^2 - x + 1)$ . Taking all the coefficients on both sides mod 2, we obtain the same expression, but we must check that these factors are irreducible over  $Z_2$ . Since  $x^2 + x + 1$  has no zeros in  $Z_2$ , it is irreducible over  $Z_2$  (see Theorem 17.1). Finally,

since  $-1 = 1$  in  $Z_{2}$ , we have the irreducible factorization  $x^{6} - 1 = (x + 1)^{2}(x^{2} + x + 1)^{2}$ . Over  $Z_{3}$ , we again start with the factorization  $x^{6} - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^{2} + x + 1)(x^{2} - x + 1)$  over  $Z$  and view the coefficients mod 3. Then 1 is a zero of  $x^{2} + x + 1$  in  $Z_{3}$ , and by long division we obtain  $x^{2} + x + 1 = (x - 1)(x + 2) = (x + 2)^{2}$ . Similarly,  $x^{2} - x + 1 = (x - 2)(x + 1) = (x + 1)^{2}$ . So, the irreducible factorization of  $x^{6} - 1$  over  $Z_{3}$  is  $(x + 1)^{3}(x + 2)^{3}$ .

We next determine the Galois group of the cyclotomic extensions of  $Q$ .

# Theorem 31.4  $\operatorname{Gal}(Q(\omega) / Q \approx U(n)$

Let  $\omega$  be a primitive  $n$ th root of unity. Then  $Gal(Q(\omega) / Q)\approx U(n)$ .

PROOF Since  $1, \omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{n-1}$  are all the  $n$ th roots of unity,  $Q(\omega)$  is the splitting field of  $x^n - 1$  over  $Q$ . For each  $k$  in  $U(n)$ ,  $\omega^k$  is a primitive  $n$ th root of unity, and by the lemma preceding Theorem 19.4, there is a field automorphism of  $Q(\omega)$ , which we denote by  $\phi_k$ , that carries  $\omega$  to  $\omega^k$  and acts as the identity on  $Q$ . Moreover, these are all the automorphisms of  $Q(\omega)$ , since any automorphism must map a primitive  $n$ th root of unity to a primitive  $n$ th root of unity. Next, observe that for every  $r$ ,  $s \in U(n)$ ,

$$
\left(\phi_ {r} \phi_ {s}\right) (\omega) = \phi_ {r} \left(\omega^ {s}\right) = \left(\phi_ {r} (\omega)\right) ^ {s} = \left(\omega^ {r}\right) ^ {s} = \omega^ {r s} \phi_ {r s} (\omega).
$$

This shows that the mapping from  $U(n)$  onto  $\operatorname{Gal}(Q(\omega)/Q)$  given by  $k \to \phi_k$  is a group homomorphism. Clearly, the mapping is an isomorphism, since  $\omega^r \neq \omega^s$  when  $r, s \in U(n)$  and  $r \neq s$ .

The next example uses Theorem 31.4 and the results of Chapter 8 to demonstrate how to determine the Galois group of cyclotomic extensions.

EXAMPLE 3 Let  $\alpha = \cos(2\pi/9) + i\sin(2\pi/9)$  and let  $\beta = \cos(2\pi/15) + i\sin(2\pi/15)$ . Then

$$
\operatorname {G a l} (Q (\alpha) / Q) \approx U (9) \approx Z _ {6}
$$

and

$$
\operatorname {G a l} (Q (\beta) / Q) \approx U (1 5) \approx U (5) \oplus U (3) \approx Z _ {4} \oplus Z _ {2}.

# The Constructible Regular  $n$ -gons

As an application of the theory of cyclotomic extensions and Galois theory, we determine exactly which regular  $n$ -gons are constructible with a straightedge and compass. But first we prove a technical lemma.

# Lemma  $Q(\cos (2\pi n))\subseteq Q(\omega)$

Let  $n$  be a positive integer and let  $\omega = \cos(2\pi / n) + i\sin(2\pi / n)$ . Then  $Q(\cos(2\pi / n)) \subseteq Q(\omega)$ .

PROOF Observe that from  $(\cos(2\pi/n) + i\sin(2\pi/n))(\cos(2\pi/n) - i\sin(2\pi/n)) = \cos^2(2\pi/n) + \sin^2(2\pi/n) = 1$ , we have  $\cos(2\pi/n) - i\sin(2\pi/n) = 1/\omega$ . Moreover,  $(\omega + 1/\omega)/2 = (2\cos(2\pi/n))/2 = \cos(2\pi/n)$ . Thus,  $\cos(2\pi/n) \in Q(\omega)$ .

Theorem 31.5 (Gauss, 1796) Constructability Criteria for a Regular  $n$ -gon

It is possible to construct the regular  $n$ -gon with a straightedge and compass if and only if  $n$  has the form  $2^k p_1 p_2 \cdots p_t$ , where  $k \geq 0$  and the  $p_i$ 's are distinct primes of the form  $2^m + 1$ .

PROOF If it is possible to construct a regular  $n$ -gon, then we can construct the angle  $2\pi / n$  and therefore the number  $\cos(2\pi / n)$ . By the results of Chapter 22, we know that  $\cos(2\pi / n)$  is constructible only if  $[Q(\cos(2\pi / n)): Q]$  is a power of 2. To determine when this is so, we will use Galois theory.

Let  $\omega = \cos(2\pi / n) + i\sin(2\pi / n)$ . Then  $|\operatorname{Gal}(Q(\omega) / Q)| = [Q(\omega):Q] = \phi(n)$ . By the lemma on the preceding page,  $Q(\cos(2\pi / n)) \subseteq Q(\omega)$ , and by Theorem 30.1 we know that

$$
\begin{array}{l} [ Q (\cos (2 \pi / n)): Q ] = | \operatorname {G a l} (Q (\omega) / Q) | / | \operatorname {G a l} (Q (\omega) / Q (\cos (2 \pi / n))) | \\ = \phi (n) / | \operatorname {G a l} (Q (\omega) / Q (\cos (2 \pi / n))) |. \\ \end{array}
$$

Recall that the elements  $\sigma$  of  $\operatorname{Gal}(Q(\omega) / Q)$  have the property that  $\sigma(\omega) = \omega^k$  for  $1 \leq k \leq n$ . That is,  $\sigma(\cos(2\pi/n) + i\sin(2\pi/n)) = \cos(2\pi k/n) + i\sin(2\pi k/n)$ . If such a  $\sigma$  belongs to  $\operatorname{Gal}(Q(\omega) / Q(\cos(2\pi/n)))$ , then we must have  $\cos(2\pi k/n) = \cos(2\pi/n)$ . Clearly, this holds only when  $k = 1$  and  $k = n - 1$ . So,  $|\operatorname{Gal}(Q(\omega) / Q(\cos(2\pi/n)))| = 2$ , and therefore  $[Q(\cos(2\pi/n)):Q] = \phi(n)/2$ . Thus, if an  $n$ -gon is constructible, then  $\phi(n)/2$  must be a power of 2. Of course, this implies that  $\phi(n)$  is a power of 2.

Write  $n = 2^k p_1^{n_1} p_2^{n_2} \cdots p_t^{n_t}$ , where  $k \geq 0$ , the  $p_i$ 's are distinct odd primes, and the  $n_i$ 's are positive. Then

$$
\begin{array}{l} \phi (n) = | U (n) | = | U (2 ^ {k}) | | U \left(p _ {1} ^ {n _ {1}}\right) | | U \left(p _ {2} ^ {n _ {2}}\right) | \dots | U \left(p _ {t} ^ {n _ {t}}\right) | \\ = 2 ^ {k - 1} p _ {1} ^ {n _ {1} - 1} (p _ {1} - 1) p _ {2} ^ {n _ {2} - 1} (p _ {2} - 1) \dots p _ {t} ^ {n _ {t} - 1} (p _ {t} - 1) \\ \end{array}
$$

must be a power of 2. Clearly, this implies that each  $n_i = 1$  and each  $p_i - 1$  is a power of 2. This completes the proof that the condition in the statement is necessary.

To prove that the condition given in Theorem 31.5 is also sufficient, suppose that  $n$  has the form  $2^k p_1p_2\cdots p_t$ , where the  $p_i$ 's are distinct odd primes of the form  $2^m + 1$ , and let  $\omega = \cos(2\pi / n) + i\sin(2\pi / n)$ . By Theorem 31.3,  $Q(\omega)$  is a splitting field of an irreducible polynomial over  $Q$ , and therefore, by the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory,  $\phi(n) = [Q(\omega):Q] = |\operatorname{Gal}(Q(\omega) / Q)|$ . Since  $\phi(n)$  is a power of 2 and  $\operatorname{Gal}(Q(\omega) / Q)$  is an Abelian group, it follows by induction (see Exercise 15) that there is a series of subgroups

$$
H _ {0} \subset H _ {1} \subset \dots \subset H _ {t} = \operatorname {G a l} (Q (\omega) / Q),
$$

where  $H_0$  is the identity,  $H_1$  is the subgroup of  $\operatorname{Gal}(Q(\omega)/Q)$  of order 2 that fixes  $\cos(2\pi/n)$ , and  $|H_{i+1}:H_i| = 2$  for  $i = 0,1,2,\ldots,t-1$ . By the

Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, we then have a series of subfields of the real numbers

$$
Q = E _ {H _ {t}} \subset E _ {H _ {t - 1}} \subset \dots \subset E _ {H _ {1}} = Q (\cos (2 \pi / n)),
$$

where  $[E_{H_{i-1}}:E_{H_i}] = 2$ . So, for each  $i$ , we may choose  $\beta_i \in E_{H_{i-1}}$  such that  $E_{H_{i-1}} = E_{H_i}(\beta_i)$ . Then  $\beta_i$  is a zero of a polynomial of the form  $x^2 + b_i x + c_i \in E_{H_i}[x]$ , and it follows that  $E_{H_{i-1}} = E_{H_i}(\sqrt{b_i^2 - 4c_i})$ . Thus, it follows from Exercise 3 in Chapter 22 that every element of  $Q(\cos(2\pi / n))$  is constructible.

It is interesting to note that Gauss did not use Galois theory in his proof. In fact, Gauss gave his proof 15 years before Galois was born.

Some authors write the expression  $2^m + 1$  in the statement of Theorem 31.5 in the form  $2^{2^k} + 1$ . These expressions are equivalent since if a prime  $p > 2$  can be written in the form  $2^m + 1$  then  $m$  must be a power of 2 (see Exercise 21).

CARL FRIEDRICH GAUSS, considered by many to be the greatest mathematician who has ever lived, was born in Brunswick, Germany, on April 30, 1777. While still a teenager, he made many fundamental discoveries. Among these were the method of "least squares" for handling statistical data, and a proof that a 17-sided regular polygon can be constructed with a straightedge and compass (this result was the first of its kind since discoveries by the Greeks 2000 years earlier). In his Ph.D. dissertation in 1799, he proved the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.

Throughout his life, Gauss largely ignored the work of his contemporaries

and, in fact, made enemies of many of them. Young mathematicians who sought encouragement from him were usually rebuffed. Despite this fact, Gauss had many outstanding students, including Eisenstein, Riemann, Kummer, Dirichlet, and Dedekind.

Gauss died in Göttingen at the age of 77 on February 23, 1855. At Brunswick, there is a statue of him. Appropriately, the base is in the shape of a 17-point star. In 1989, Germany issued a bank note (see Chapter 5) depicting Gauss and the Gaussian distribution.

# Manjul Bhargava

We are watching him [Bhargava] very closely. He is going to be a superstar. He's amazingly mature mathematically. He is changing the subject in a fundamental way.

PETER SARNAK

MANJUL BHARGAVA was born in Canada on August 8, 1974, and grew up in Long Island, New York. After graduating from Harvard in 1996, Bhargava went to Princeton to pursue his Ph.D. under the direction of Andrew Wiles (see biography after Chapter 18). Bhargava investigated a "composition law" first formulated by Gauss in 1801 for combining two quadratic equations (equations in a form such as  $x^{2} + 3xy + 6y^{2} = 0$ ) in a way that was very different from normal addition and revealed a lot of information about number systems. Bhargava tackled an aspect of the problem in which no progress had been made in more than 200 years. He not only broke new ground in that area but also discovered 13 more composition laws and developed a coherent mathematical framework to explain them. He then applied his theory of composition to solve a number of fundamental problems concerning the distribution of extension fields of the rational numbers and of other, related algebraic objects. What made Bhargava's work especially remarkable is that he was able to explain

all his revolutionary ideas using only elementary mathematics. In commenting on Bhargava's results, Wiles said, "He did it in a way that Gauss himself could have understood and appreciated."

Among Bhargava's many awards are the Blumenthal Award for the Advancement of Research in Pure Mathematics, the SASTRA Ramanujan Prize, the Cole Prize in number theory, the Fermat Prize,Infosys Prize, and the Fields Medal (see Chapter 24).He has been elected to the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and is a Fellow of the Royal Society.

1.  $\{1,2,3,4\}$  ；  $\{1,3,5,7\}$  
3. 12, 2, 2, 10, 1, 0, 4, 5  
5. Let  $a$  be the least common multiple of every element of the set and  $b$  be any common multiple of every element of the set. Write  $b = aq + r$  where  $0 \leq r < a$ . Then for any element  $c$  in the set we have that  $c$  divides  $b - aq = r$ . This means that  $r$  is a common multiple of every element of the set and therefore is greater than or equal to  $a$ , which is a contradiction.  
7. By using 0 as an exponent if necessary, we may write  $a = p_1^{m_1}\dots p_k^{m_k}$  and  $b = p_1^{n_1}\dots p_k^{n_k}$ , where the  $p$ 's are distinct primes and the  $m$ 's and  $n$ 's are nonnegative. Then  $\operatorname{lcm}(a,b) = p_1^{s_1}\dots p_k^{s_k}$ , where  $s_i = \max(m_i,n_i)$ , and  $\gcd(a,b) = p_1^{t_1}\dots p_k^{t_k}$ , where  $t_i = \min(m_i,n_i)$ . Then  $\operatorname{lcm}(a,b)\cdot \gcd(a,b) = p_1^{m_1 + n_1}\dots p_k^{m_k + n_k} = ab$ .  
9. Write  $a = nq_{1} + r_{1}$  and  $b = nq_{2} + r_{2}$

where  $0 \leq r_1, r_2 < n$ . We may assume that  $r_1 \geq r_2$ . Then

$a - b = n(q_{1} - q_{2}) + (r_{1} - r_{2})$  , where  $r_1 - r_2\geq 0$  . If  $a$  mod  $n = b$  mod  $n$  , then  $r_1 = r_2$  and  $n$  divides  $a - b$  . If  $n$  divides  $a - b$  , then by the uniqueness of the remainder, we have  $r_1 - r_2 = 0$

11. Use Exercise 9.  
13. Use Theorem 0.2.  
15. By Theorem 0.2 there are integers  $s$  and  $t$  such that  $ms + nt = 1$ . Then  $m(sr) + n(tr) = r$ .  
17. Let  $p$  be a prime greater than 3. By the division algorithm, we can write  $p$  in the form  $6n + r$ , where  $r$  satisfies  $0 \leq r < 6$ . Now observe that  $6n$ ,  $6n + 2$ ,  $6n + 3$ , and  $6n + 4$  are not prime.  
19. Since  $st$  divides  $a - b$ , both  $s$  and  $t$  divide  $a - b$ . The converse is true when  $\gcd(s, t) = 1$ .  
21. Use Euclid's Lemma and the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.  
23. Use proof by contradiction.  
25.  $x$  NAND  $y$  is 1 if and only if both inputs are 0;  $x$  XNOR  $y$  is 1 if and only if both inputs are the same.  
27. Let  $S$  be a set with  $n + 1$  elements and pick some  $a$  in  $S$ . By induction,  $S$  has  $2^n$  subsets that do not contain  $a$ . But there is a one-to-one correspondence between the subsets of  $S$  that do not contain  $a$  and those that do. So, there are  $2 \cdot 2^n = 2^{n + 1}$  subsets in all.

29. Consider  $n = 200! + 2$ .  
31. Say  $p_1p_2 \ldots p_r = q_1q_2 \ldots q_s$ , where the  $p$ 's and  $q$ 's are primes. By the Generalized Euclid's Lemma,  $p_1$  divides some  $q_i$ , say  $q_1$  (we may relabel the  $q$ 's if necessary). Then  $p_1 = q_1$  and  $p_2 \ldots p_r = q_2 \ldots q_s$ . Repeating this argument at each step, we obtain  $p_2 = q_2, \ldots, p_r = q_r$  and  $r = s$ .  
33. Suppose that  $S$  is a set that contains  $a$  and whenever  $n \geq a$  belongs to  $S$ , then  $n + 1 \in S$ . We must prove that  $S$  contains all integers greater than or equal to  $a$ . Let  $T$  be the set of all integers greater than  $a$  that are not in  $S$  and suppose that  $T$  is not empty. Let  $b$  be the smallest integer in  $T$  (if  $T$  has no negative integers,  $b$  exists because of the Well Ordering Principle; if  $T$  has negative integers, it can have only a finite number of them so that there is a smallest one). Then  $b - 1 \in S$ , and therefore  $b = (b - 1) + 1 \in S$ .  
35. For  $n = 1$ , observe that  $1^{3} + 2^{3} + 3^{3} = 36$ . Assume that  $n^{3} + (n + 1)^{3} + (n + 2)^{3} = 9m$  for some integer  $m$ . We must prove that  $(n + 1)^{3} + (n + 2)^{3} + (n + 3)^{3}$  is a multiple of 9. Using the induction hypothesis we have that  $(n + 1)^{3} + (n + 2)^{3} + (n + 3)^{3} = 9m - n^{3} + (n + 3)^{3} = 9m - n^{3} + n^{3} + 3 \cdot n^{2} \cdot 3 + 3 \cdot n \cdot 9 + 3^{3} = 9m + 9n^{2} + 27n + 27$ .  
37. The statement is true for any divisor of  $8^{3} - 4 = 508$ .  
39. 6 P.M.  
41. Observe that the number with the decimal representation  $a_9a_8\ldots a_1a_0$  is  $a_9\cdot 10^9 +a_8\cdot 10^8 +\dots +a_1\cdot 10 + a_0.$  Then use Exercise 9 and the fact that  $a_{i}10^{i}\mathrm{mod}9 = a_{i}\mathrm{mod}9$  to deduce that the check digit is  $(a_{9} + a_{8} + \dots +a_{1} + a_{0})$  mod 9.  
43. For the case in which the check digit is not involved, see the answer to Exercise 41. If a transposition involving the check digit  $c = (a_{1} + a_{2} + \dots + a_{10}) \mod 9$  goes undetected, then  $a_{10} = (a_{1} + a_{2} + \dots + a_{9} + c) \mod 9$ . Substitution yields  $2(a_{1} + a_{2} + \dots + a_{9}) \mod 9 = 0$ . Therefore, modulo 9, we have  $10(a_{1} + a_{2} + \dots + a_{9}) = a_{1} + a_{2} + \dots + a_{9} = 0$ . It follows that  $c = a_{10}$ . In this case the transposition does not yield an error.

47. Cases where  $(2a - b - c) \bmod 11 = 0$  are undetected.  
49. No.  $(1,0)\in R$  and  $(0, - 1)\in R$  , but  $(1, - 1)\in R$  
51.  $a$  belongs to the same subset as  $a$ . If  $a$  and  $b$  belong to the subset  $A$ , then  $b$  and  $a$  also belong to  $A$ . If  $a$  and  $b$  belong to the subset  $A$  and  $b$  and  $c$  belong to the subset  $B$ , then  $A = B$ , since the distinct subsets of  $P$  are disjoint. So,  $a$  and  $c$  belong to  $A$ .

When  $n$  is odd, the axes of reflection are the lines from the vertices to the midpoints of the opposite sides. When  $n$  is even, half of the axes of reflection are obtained by joining opposite vertices; the other half, by joining midpoints of opposite sides.

9. Observe that  $1 \cdot 1 = 1; 1(-1) = -1; (-1)1 = -1; (-1)(-1) = 1$ . These relationships also hold when 1 is replaced by "rotation" and -1 is replaced by "reflection."  
11. Thinking geometrically and observing that even powers of elements of a dihedral group do not change orientation, we note that each of  $a$ ,  $b$  and  $c$  appears an even number of times in the expression. So, there is no change in orientation. Thus, the expression is a rotation.

21. First observe that squaring  $R_0$ ,  $R_{180}$  or any reflection gives  $R_0$  and squaring  $R_{90}$  or  $R_{270}$  gives  $R_{180}$ . Thus  $X^2 Y = Y$  or  $X^2 Y = R_{180}Y$ . Since  $Y \neq R_{90}$  we have  $X^2 Y = R_{180}Y$  and  $X^2 Y = R_{90}$ . Thus  $R_{180}Y = R_{90}$ . Solving for  $Y$  gives  $Y = R_{270}$ .  
23. The  $n$  rotations of  $D_{n}$  are  $R_0,R_{360 / n},R_{360 / n}^2,\ldots ,R_{360 / n}^{n - 1}$  .Suppose that  $n = 2k$  for some positive integer  $k$  Then  $R_{360 / n}^{k} = R_{360k / 2k} = R_{180}$  Conversely, if  $R_{360 / n}^{k} = R_{180}$  then  $360k / n = 180$  and therefore  $2k = n$  
25. Let  $p$  be any vertex on the  $n$ -gon and  $p'$  be the counterclockwise vertex adjacent to  $p$ . Let  $F$  be the reflection that passes through  $p$  and let  $F'$  be the reflection that passes through the midpoint of the edge joining  $p$  and  $p'$ . Then, in the composition  $FF'$ , the reflection  $F$  fixes  $p$  and the reflection  $F'$  takes  $p$  to  $p'$ . So,  $FF' = R_{360} / n$ .

19. Observe that  $a^5 = e$  and  $b^7 = e$  imply that  $a^{-2} = a^3$  and  $b^{-4} = b^3$ . Thus,  $a^{-2}b^{-4} = a^3b^3$ . Moreover,  $(a^2b^4)^{-2} = ((a^2b^4)^{-1})^2 = (b^{-4}a^{-2})^2 = (b^3a^3)^2 = b^3a^3b^3a^3$ .

21. Use  $\operatorname{det}(AB) = (\operatorname{det}A)(\operatorname{det}B)$ .  
23. 29  
25. For  $n\geq 0$  , use induction. For  $n <   0$  , note that  $e = (ab)^{0} = (ab)^{n}(ab)^{-n} = (ab)^{n}a^{-n}b^{-n}$  so that  $a^n b^n = (ab)^n$  . In a non-Abelian group  $(ab)^n$  need not equal  $a^n b^n$  
27. Use the Socks-Shoes Property.  
29. For the case  $n > 0$ , use induction. For  $n < 0$ , note that  $e = (a^{-1}ba)^n (a^{-1}ba)^{-n} = (a^{-1}ba)^n (a^{-1}b^{-n}a)$  and solve for  $(a^{-1}ba)^n$ .  
31.  $\{1, 3, 5, 9, 13, 15, 19, 23, 25, 27, 39, 45\}$  
33. Suppose  $x$  appears in a row labeled with  $a$  twice; say,  $x = ab$  and  $x = ac$ . Then cancellation yields  $b = c$ . But we use distinct elements to label the columns.  
35. Closure and associativity follow from the definition of multiplication;  $a = b = c = 0$  gives the identity; we may find inverses by solving the equations  $a + a' = 0$ ,  $b' + ac' + b = 0$ ,  $c' + c = 0$  for  $a', b', c'$ .  
37. Since  $e$  is one solution it suffices to show that nonidentity solutions come in distinct pairs. To this end note that if  $x^n = e$  and  $x \neq e$ , then  $(x^{-1})^n = e$  and  $x \neq x^{-1}$ . So if we can find one nonidentity solution we can find a second one. Now suppose that  $a$  and  $a^{-1}$  are nonidentity elements that satisfy  $x^n = e$  and  $b$  is a nonidentity element such that  $b \neq a$  and  $b \neq a^{-1}$  and  $b^n = e$ . Then, as before,  $(b^{-1})^n = e$  and  $b \neq b^{-1}$ .  
Moreover,  $b^{-1} \neq a$  and  $b^{-1} \neq a^{-1}$ . Thus, finding a third nonidentity solution gives a fourth one. Continuing in this fashion we see that we always have an even number of nonidentity solutions to the equation  $x^{3} = e$ .  
To prove the second statement note that if  $x^{2} \neq e$ , then  $x^{-1} \neq x$  and  $(x^{-1})^2 \neq e$ . So, arguing as in the preceding case we see that solutions to  $x^{2} \neq e$  come in distinct pairs.  
39. If  $F_{1}F_{2} = R_{0}$ , then  $F_{1}F_{1} = F_{1}F_{2}$  and by cancellation  $F_{1} = F_{2}$ .  
41. Since  $FR^k$  is a reflection we know that  $(FR^k)(FR^k) = R_0$ . So  $R^k FR^k = F^{-1} = F$ .  
43.  $R, R^{-1}F$  
45. Since  $a^2 = b^2 = (ab)^2 = e$ , we have  $aabb = abab$ . Now cancel on the left and right.

47. The matrix  $\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix}$  is in  $GL(2, Z_2)$  if and only if  $ad \neq bc$ . This happens when  $a$  and  $d$  are 1 and at least 1 of  $b$  and  $c$  is 0, and when  $b$  and  $c$  are 1 and at least 1 of  $a$  and  $d$  is 0.  $\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$  and  $\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$  do not commute.  
49. Use Exercise 33.

1.  $|Z_{12}| = 12$ ;  $|U(10)| = 4$ ;  $|U(12)| = 4$  
In each case, notice that the order of the element divides the order of the group.  
3. In  $Q, |0| = 1$  and all other elements have infinite order. In  $Q^{*}, |1| = 1, |-1| = 2$ , and all other elements have infinite order.

13.  $D_4$ ;  $D_4$ ; it contains  $\{R_0, R_{180}, H, V\}$  
15. If  $n$  is a positive integer, the real solutions of  $x^n = 1$  are 1 when  $n$  is odd and  $\pm 1$  when  $n$  is even. So, the only elements of finite order in  $R^*$  are  $\pm 1$ .  
17. By Exercise 29 of Chapter 2 we have  $e = (xax^{-1})^n = xa^n x^{-1}$  if and only if  $a^n = e$ .  
19. Suppose  $G = H \cup K$ . Pick  $h \in H$  with  $h \notin k$ . Pick  $k \in K$  with  $k \notin H$ . Then,  $hk \in G$  but  $hk \notin H$  and  $hk \notin K$ .  $U(8) = \{1, 3\} \cup \{1, 5\} \cup \{1, 7\}$ .  
21.  $U_{4}(20) = \{1,9,13,17\} ;U_{5}(20) =$ $\{1,11\} ;U_5(30) = \{1,11\} ;U_{10}(30) =$ $\{1,11\}$  . To prove that  $U_{k}(n)$  is a

subgroup, it suffices to show that it is closed. Suppose that  $a$  and  $b$  belong to  $U_{k}(n)$ . We must show that in  $U(n)$ ,  $ab \mod k = 1$ . That is,  $(ab \mod n) \mod k = 1$ . Let  $n = kt$  and  $ab = qn + r$  where  $0 \leq r < n$ . Then  $(ab \mod n) \mod k = r \mod k = (ab - qn) \mod k = (ab - qkt) \mod k = ab \mod k = (a \mod k)(b \mod k) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1$ .  $H$  is not a subgroup because  $7 \in H$  but  $7 \cdot 7 = 9$  is not  $1 \mod 3$ .  
23. Suppose that  $m < n$  and  $a^m = a^n$ . Then  $e = a^n a^{-m} = a^{n - m}$ . This contradicts the assumption that  $a$  has infinite order.  
25. det  $A = \pm 1$  
27.  $\langle 3\rangle = \{3,3^{2},3^{3},3^{4},3^{5},3^{6}\} =$ $\{3,9,13,11,5,1\} = U(14). \langle 5\rangle =$ $\{5,5^2,5^3,5^4,5^5,5^6\} = \{5,11,13,9,3,1\} =$ $U(14). \langle 11\rangle = \{11,9,1\} \neq U(14).$  Since  $|U(20)| = 8$  , for  $U(20) = \langle k\rangle$  for some  $k$  it must the case that  $|k| = 8$  .But  $1^{1} = 1$ $3^{4} = 1$ $7^{4} = 1$ $9^{2} = 1$ $11^{2} = 1$ $13^{4} = 1$ $17^{4} = 1$  , and  $19^{2} = 1$  . So, the maximum order of any element is 4.  
29. By Exercise 28, either every element of  $H$  is even or exactly half are even. Since  $H$  has odd order the latter cannot occur.  
31. By Exercise 30, either every element of  $H$  is a rotation or exactly half are rotations. Since  $H$  has odd order the latter cannot occur.  
33. Since  $n$  is even,  $D_{n}$  contains  $R_{180}$ . Let  $F$  be any reflection in  $D_{n}$ . Then the set  $\{R_0,R_{180},F,R_{180}F\}$  is closed and therefore is a subgroup of  $D_{n}$ .  
35.  $\langle 2\rangle ,\langle 3\rangle ,\langle 6\rangle$  
37. Suppose that  $H$  is a subgroup of  $D_{3}$  of order 4. Since  $D_{3}$  has only two elements of order 2,  $H$  must contain  $R_{120}$  or  $R_{240}$ . By closure, it follows that  $H$  must contain  $R_{0}, R_{120}$ , and  $R_{240}$  as well as some reflection  $F$ . But then  $H$  must also contain the reflection  $R_{120}F$ .  
39. For  $D_{6}$  the subgroups of order 6 have the form  $\{R_0,R_{60},R_{120},R_{180},R_{240},R_{300}\}$  and  $\{R_0,R_{120},R_{240},F,R_{120}F,R_{240}F\}$  where  $F$  is a reflection. For the general case where  $n > 3$  is even, we have the set of  $n$  rotations is a subgroup of order  $n$ . For a second subgroup of order  $n$ , let  $R = R_{360 / n}$  and  $F$  be any reflection in  $D_{n}$ . Then  $H =$

$\{R_0,R^2,\ldots ,R^{n - 2},R_0,F,R^2 F,\ldots ,R^{n - 2}F\}$  is a subgroup of  $D_{n}$  of order  $n$  . (Closure follows from the relation  $FR^{i} = R^{-i}F$  ). Since  $H$  contains only half of the reflections in  $D_{n}$  we can obtain a third subgroup of order  $n$  by replacing  $F$  in  $H$  by any reflection  $F^{\prime}$  not in  $H$  . To see that these three subgroups are the only ones, note that any other subgroup  $K$  in  $D_{n}$ $(n\geq 4)$  must have the same  $n / 2$  rotations and  $n / 2$  reflections. But every reflection is contained in of the two subgroups described above, so  $K$  would be contained in one of the two. So, the number of subgroups of order  $n > 3$  is even is 3.  
41. If  $x \in Z(G)$ , then  $x \in C(a)$  for all  $a$ , so  $x \in \cap_{a \in G} C(a)$ . If  $x \in \cap_{a \in G} C(a)$ , then  $xa = ax$  for all  $a$  in  $G$ , so  $x \in Z(G)$ .  
43. The case that  $k = 0$  is trivial. Let  $x \in C(a)$ . If  $k$  is positive, then by induction on  $k$ ,  $xa^{k + 1} = xaa^k = axa^k = aa^kx = a^{k + 1}x$ . The case where  $k$  is negative now follows from Exercise 34. In a group, if  $x$  commutes with  $a$ , then  $x$  commutes with all powers of  $a$ . If  $x$  commutes with  $a^k$  for some  $k$ , then  $x$  need not commute with  $a$ .  
45. a. First observe that because  $\langle S\rangle$  is a subgroup of  $G$  containing  $S$ , it is a member of the intersection. So,  $H\subseteq \langle S\rangle$ . On the other hand, since  $H$  is a subgroup of  $G$  and  $H$  contains  $S$ , by definition  $\langle S\rangle \subseteq H$ .  
b. Let  $K = \{s_1^{n_1}s_2^{n_2}\dots s_m^{n_m} \mid m\geq 1, s_i\in S, n_i\in Z\}$ . Then because  $K$  satisfies the subgroup test and contains  $S$ , we have  $\langle S\rangle \subseteq K$ . On the other hand, if  $L$  is any subgroup of  $G$  that contains  $S$ , then  $L$  also contains  $K$  by closure. Thus, by part a,  $H = \langle S\rangle$  contains  $K$ .  
47. Mimic the proof of Theorem 3.5.  
49. No. In  $D_4, C(R_{180}) = D_4$ . Yes. Elements in the center commute with all elements.  
51. For the first part, see Example 4. For the second part, use  $D_4$ .  
53. Note that  $\left[ \begin{array}{ll}1 & 1\\ 0 & 1 \end{array} \right]^n = \left[ \begin{array}{ll}1 & n\\ 0 & 1 \end{array} \right]$  
55. First observe that  $(a^d)^{n / d} = a^n = e$ , so  $|a^{d}|$  is at most  $n / d$ . Moreover, there is no positive integer  $t < n / d$  such that  $(a^{d})^{t} = a^{dt} = e$ , for otherwise  $|a| \neq n$ .

57. Let  $G$  be a group of even order. Observe that for each element  $x$  of order greater than  $2x$  and  $x^{-1}$  are distinct elements of the same order. So, because elements of order greater than 2 come in pairs, there is an even number of elements of order greater than 2 (possibly 0). This means that the number of elements of order 1 or 2 is even. Since the identity is the unique element of order 1, it follows that the number of order 2 is odd.  
59. For any positive integer  $n$ , a rotation of  $360^{\circ} / n$  has order  $n$ . A rotation of  $\sqrt{2}$  degrees has infinite order.  
61. Inscribe a regular  $n$ -gon in a circle. Then every element of  $D_{n}$  is a symmetry of the circle.  
63. Let  $|g| = m$  and write  $m = nq + r$ , where  $0 \leq r < n$ . Then  $g^{r} = g^{m - nq} = g^{m}(g^{n})^{-q} = (g^{n})^{-q}$  belongs to  $H$ . So,  $r = 0$ .  
65.  $1\in H$  .Let  $a,b\in H$  .Then  $(ab^{-1})^2 = a^2 (b^2)^{-1}$  , which is the product of two rationals. 2 can be replaced by any positive integer.  
67. Let  $|a| = n$  and  $m = nq = r$  where  $0 \leq r < n$ . Then  $a^r = a^{m - nq} = a^m (a^{-q})^n = ee = e$ . So,  $r = 0$ .  
69. In  $Z_{6}$ ,  $H = \{0,1,3,5\}$  is not closed.  
71. a. Let  $xh_1x^{-1}$  and  $xh_2x^{-1}$  belong to  $xHx^{-1}$ . Then  $(xh_1x^{-1})(xh_2x^{-1})^{-1} = xh_1h_2^{-1}x^{-1} \in xHx^{-1}$  also.  
b. Let  $\langle h \rangle = H$ . Then  $\langle xhx^{-1} \rangle = xHx^{-1}$ .  
c.  $(xh_1x^{-1})(xh_2x^{-1}) = xh_1h_2x^{-1} = xh_2h_1x^{-1} = (xh_2x^{-1})(xh_1x^{-1})$ .  
73. Let  $a / b$  and  $c / d$  belong to the set. By observation  $ac / bd$  and  $b / a$  have odd numerators and denominators. If  $ac / bd$  reduces in lowest terms to  $x / y$  then  $x$  divides  $ac$  and  $y$  divides  $bd$ . So they are odd.  
75. If  $2^a$  and  $2^b \in K$ , then  $2^a (2^b)^{-1} = 2^{a - b} \in K$ , since  $a - b \in H$ .  
77.  $\left[ \begin{array}{ll}2 & 0\\ 0 & 2 \end{array} \right]^{-1} = \left[ \begin{array}{ll}\frac{1}{2} & 0\\ 0 & \frac{1}{2} \end{array} \right]$  is not in  $H$  
79. If  $a + bi$  and  $c + di \in H$ , then  $(a + bi)(c + di)^{-1} = (ac + bd) + (bc - ad)i$  and  $(ac + bd)^2 + (bc - ad)^2 = 1$ , so that  $H$  is a subgroup.  $H$  is the unit circle in the complex plane.  
81.  $\{1,2n - 1,2n + 1,4n - 1\}$

83. In  $D_{10}$  let  $a$  be any reflection and  $b = R_{36}$ .  
85. First observe that  $2^{n} - 1$  and  $2^{n-2} \pm 1$  are in  $U(2^{n})$  and satisfy  $x^{2} = 1$ . Now suppose that  $x \in U(2^{n})$ ,  $x \neq 1$ , and  $x^{2} = 1 \mod 2^{n}$ . From  $x^{2} = 1 \mod 2^{n}$  we have that  $x^{2} - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)$  is divisible by  $2^{n}$ . Since  $x - 1$  and  $x + 1$  are even and  $n \geq 3$ , we know that at least one of  $x - 1$  and  $x + 1$  is divisible by 4. Moreover, it cannot be the case that both  $x - 1$  and  $x + 1$  are divisible by 4 for then so would  $(x + 1) - (x - 1) = 2$ . If  $x - 1$  is not divisible by 4, then  $x + 1$  is divisible by  $2^{n-1}$ . Thus  $x + 1 = k2^{n-1}$  for some integer  $k$  and  $k2^{n-1} = x + 1 \leq 2^{n}$ . So,  $k = 1$  or  $k = 2$ . For  $k = 1$ , we have  $x = 2^{n-1} - 1$ . For  $k = 2$ , we have  $x = 2^{n} - 1$ . If  $x + 1$  is not divisible by 4, then  $x - 1$  is divisible by  $2^{n-1}$ . Thus  $x - 1 = k2^{n-1}$  for some integer  $k$  and  $k2^{n-1} = x - 1 < 2^{n}$ . So,  $k = 1$  and  $x = 2^{n-1} + 1$ .  
87. Since  $ee = e$  is in  $HZ(G)$ , it is nonempty. Let  $h_1z_1$  and  $h_2z_2$  belong to  $HZ(G)$ . Then  $h_1z_1(h_2z_2)^{-1} = h_1z_1z_2^{-1}h_2^{-1} = h_1h_2^{-1}z_1z_2^{-1} \in HZ(G)$ .  
89. Use Exercise 88.

1. For  $Z_{6}$ , generators are 1 and 5; for  $Z_{8}$ , generators are 1, 3, 5, and 7; for  $Z_{20}$ , generators are 1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, and 19.  
3.  $\langle 20\rangle = \{20,10,0\}$  .  $\langle 10\rangle = \{10,20,0\} ;$ $\langle a^{20}\rangle = \{a^{20},a^{10},a^0\} ;\langle a^{10}\rangle =$ $\{a^{10},a^{20},a^0\}$  
5.  $\langle 3\rangle = \{3,9,7,1\}$  .  $\langle 7\rangle = \{7,9,3,1\}$  
7. This follows directly from Corollary 2 of Theorem 4.1.  
9. Six subgroups; generators are the divisors of 20. Six subgroups; generators are  $a^k$ , where  $k$  is a divisor of 20.  
11. By definition,  $a^{-1}\in \langle a\rangle$  . So,  $\langle a^{-1}\rangle \subseteq \langle a\rangle$  By definition,  $a = (a^{-1})^{-1}\in \langle a^{-1}\rangle$  . So,  $\langle a\rangle \subseteq \langle a^{-1}\rangle$

13. In  $Z$ ,  $\langle m\rangle \cap \langle n\rangle = \operatorname{lcm}(m,n)$ . In  $Z_{k}$ ,  $\langle m\rangle \cap \langle n\rangle = \operatorname{lcm}(m,n) \mod k$ . If  $|a| = \infty$ ,  $\langle a^{m}\rangle \cap \langle a^{n}\rangle = a^{\operatorname{lcm}(m,n)}$ . If  $|a| = k$ ,  $\langle a^{m}\rangle \cap \langle a^{n}\rangle = a^{\operatorname{lcm}(m,n)} \mod k$ .  
15.  $|g|$  divides 12 is equivalent to  $g^{12} = e$ . So, if  $a^{12} = e$  and  $b^{12} = e$ , then  $(ab^{-1})^{12} = a^{12}(b^{12})^{-1} = ee^{-1} = e$ . The same argument works when 12 is replaced by any integer (see Exercise 51 of Chapter 3).  
17. By Theorem 4.2 we have  $|\langle a^6\rangle | = n / \gcd (n,6)$  . Since  $n$  is odd and  $\langle a^6\rangle$  is a proper subgroup we have  $\gcd (n,6) = 3$  . So,  $|\langle a^6\rangle | = n / 3$  
19. If  $|a^2| = 3$ ,  $|a|$  is 3 or 6. If  $|a^2| = 4$ ,  $|a| = 8$ .  
21. For every  $a$  and  $b$  we have  $ab = (ab)^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1} = ba$ .  
23. Let  $|a| = m$ ,  $|b| = n$ ,  $|ab| = k$  and  $\gcd(m, n) = d$ . Then  $\operatorname{lcm}(m, n) = mn / d$  and  $(ab)^{mn / d} = (a^m)^{n / d}(b^{n / d})^m = ee = e$  so  $k$  divides  $\operatorname{lcm}(m, n)$ . So, if  $d > 1$ , then  $k < mn$ . If  $d = 1$ , then  $\langle a \rangle \cap \langle b \rangle = \{e\}$  because  $|\langle a \rangle \cap \langle b \rangle|$  divides both  $|\langle a \rangle|$  and  $|\langle b \rangle|$ . We also have  $e = (ab)^k = a^kb^k$  and therefore  $a^k = b^{-k} \in \langle a \rangle \cap \langle b \rangle = \{e\}$ .  
25. Exercise 31 in Chapter 3 tells us that  $H$  is a subgroup of the cyclic group of  $n$  rotations in  $D_{n}$ . So, by Theorem 4.3,  $H$  is cyclic.

29. a.  $|a|$  divides 12. b.  $|a|$  divides  $m$ . c. By Theorem 4.3,  $|a| = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12$ , or 24. If  $|a| = 2$ , then  $a^8 = (a^2)^4 = e^4 = e$ . A similar argument eliminates all other possibilities except 24.  
31. Yes, by Theorem 4.3. The subgroups of  $Z$  are of the form  $\langle n \rangle = \{0, \pm n, \pm 2n, \pm 3n, \ldots\}$ ,  $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots$ . The subgroups of  $\langle a \rangle$  are of the form  $\langle a^n \rangle$  for  $n = 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots$ .  
33. For the first part, apply Theorem 4.3 to the subgroup of rotations;  $D_{n}$  has  $n$  elements of order 2 when  $n$  is odd and  $n + 1$  elements of order 2 when  $n$  is even.  
35. See Example 16 of Chapter 2.  
37. 1000000, 3000000, 5000000, 7000000; by Theorem 4.3,  $\langle 1000000\rangle$  is the unique subgroup of order 8, and only those on the list are generators.  $a^{1000000}, a^{3000000}, a^{5000000}, a^{7000000}$ ; by

Theorem 4.3,  $\langle a^{1000000}\rangle$  is the unique subgroup of order 8, and only those on the list are generators.

39. Let  $G = \{a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{k}\}$ . Now let  $|a_{i}| = n_{i}$ . Consider  $n = n_{1}n_{2}\dots n_{k}$  
41. The lattice is a vertical line with successive terms from top to bottom  $\langle p^0\rangle ,\langle p^1\rangle ,\langle p^3\rangle ,\ldots ,\langle p^{n - 1}\rangle ,\langle 0\rangle$  
43. Suppose that  $a / b$  generates all positive rationals under multiplication. Because  $\langle a / b \rangle = \langle (a / b)^{-1} \rangle = \langle b / a \rangle$  we may assume that  $1 < a / b$ . Then from  $1 < a / b < (a / b)^2 < (a / b)^3 < \ldots$ , we see that  $\langle a / b \rangle$  does not contain any rational number  $k$  strictly between 1 and  $ab$ .  
45. For 7, use  $Z_{2^6}$ . For  $n$ , use  $Z_{2^{n-1}}$ .  
47. Suppose that  $|ab| = n$ . Then  $(ab)^n = e$  implies that  $b^n = a^{-n} \in \langle a \rangle$ , which is finite. Thus  $b^n = e$ .  
49. 50; 10  
51. All divisors of 60  
53. The argument given in the proof of the corollary to Theorem 4.4 shows that in an infinite group, the number of elements of finite order  $n$  is a multiple of  $\phi(n)$  or there is an infinite number of elements of order  $n$ .  
55. It follows from Example 16 in Chapter 2 and Example 15 in Chapter 0 that the group  $H = \langle \cos (360^{\circ} / n) + i\sin (360^{\circ} / n)\rangle$  is a cyclic group of order  $n$  and every member of this group satisfies  $x^n - 1 = 0$ . Moreover, since every element of order  $n$  satisfies  $x^n - 1 = 0$  and there can be at most  $n$  such elements, all complex numbers of order  $n$  are in  $H$ . Thus, by Theorem 4.4,  $\mathbf{C}^*$  has exactly  $\phi(n)$  elements of order  $n$ .  
57. Let  $x \in Z(G)$  and  $|x| = p$  where  $p$  is prime. Say  $y \in G$  with  $|y| = q$  where  $q$  is prime. Then  $(xy)^{pq} = e$  and therefore  $|xy| = 1, p$ , or  $q$ . If  $|xy| = 1$ , then  $p = q$ . If  $|xy| = p$ , then  $e = (xy)^p = y^p$  and  $q$  divides  $p$ . Thus,  $q = p$ . A similar argument applies if  $|xy| = q$ .  
59. An infinite cyclic group does not have an element of prime order. A finite cyclic group can have only one subgroup for each divisor of its order. A subgroup of order  $p$  has exactly  $p - 1$  elements of order  $p$ . Another element of order  $p$  would give another subgroup of order  $p$ .

65. 1, 2, 10, 20. In general, if an Abelian group contains cyclic subgroups of order  $m$  and  $n$  where  $m$  and  $n$  are relatively prime, then it contains subgroups of order  $d$  for each divisor  $d$  of  $mn$ .  
67. Say  $a$  and  $b$  are distinct elements of order 2. If  $a$  and  $b$  commute, then  $ab$  is a third element of order 2. If  $a$  and  $b$  do not commute, then  $aba$  is a third element of order 2.  
69. Use Exercise 38 of Chapter 3 and Theorem 4.3.  
71. 1 and 2.  
73. Suppose that  $G$  has 14 elements of order 3. Let  $a \in G$  and  $a \neq e$ . Let  $b \in G$  and  $b \notin \langle a \rangle$ . Then, by cancellation,  $H = \{a^i b^j \mid i, j \text{ are } 0, 1, 2\}$  has exactly nine elements and is closed and therefore is a subgroup of  $G$ . Let  $c \in G$  and  $c \notin H$ . Then, by cancellation, the nine expressions of the form  $a^i b^j c$  where  $i, j$  are  $0, 1, 2$  are distinct and have no overlap with the nine elements of  $H$ . But that gives 18 elements in  $G$ .  
75. 12 or 60; 48

79. Since  $|e| = 1$ ,  $H$  is nonempty. Assume  $a, b \in H$  and let  $|a| = m$  and  $|b| = n$ . Then  $(ab)^{mn} = (a^m)^n (b^n)^m = e^n e^m = ee = e$ . So,  $|ab|$  divides  $mn$ . Since  $mn$  is odd, so is  $|ab|$ .  
81. See Example 7 in Chapter 3.  
83. Observe that  $n^2 - 1 = -1$  and  $n$  are in  $U(n^2 - 1)$  and have order 2. (It follows from the Corollary of Theorem 0.2 in Chapter 0 that  $n$  is relatively prime to both  $n - 1$  and  $n + 1$ .) Thus  $\{\pm 1, \pm n\}$  is closed and therefore is a subgroup.  
85. Observe that among the integers from 1 to  $p^n$ , the  $p^{n-1}$  integers  $p, 2p, 3p, \ldots, p^{n-1}p$  are exactly the ones that are not relatively prime to  $p$ . Then  $x^6 = e$  and therefore  $|x|$  divides 6 and 15. This implies that  $|x| = 3$ . Then  $|x^{13}| = |x(x^3)^4| = |x| = 3$ . If  $x^5 = x^9$ , then  $x^4 = e$  and  $|x|$  divides both 4 and 15, and therefore  $x = e$ .

11. even; odd  
13. Say  $S = \{s_1, \ldots, s_n\}$  and  $\phi$  is one-to-one from  $S$  to  $S$ . Then  $\phi(s_1), \ldots, \phi(s_n)$  are all distinct and all in  $S$  so  $\phi(S) = S$ . On the other hand, if  $\phi(s_i) = \phi(s_j)$  for some  $i \neq j$ , then  $\phi(S)$  has at most  $n - 1$  members. The mapping from  $Z$  to  $Z$  that takes  $x$  to  $2x$  is one-to-one but not onto.  
15. Suppose that  $\alpha$  can be written as a product of  $m$  2-cycles and  $\beta$  can be written as a product of  $n$  2-cycles. Then  $\alpha \beta$  can be written as a product of  $m + n$  2-cycles. Now observe that  $m + n$  is even if and only if  $m$  and  $n$  are both even or both odd.  
17.  $n$  is odd.  
19. If  $\alpha$  is the product of  $m$  2-cycles and  $\beta$  is the product of  $n$  2-cycles then  $\alpha^{-5}\beta\alpha^3$  is the product of  $8m + n$  and  $8m + n$  is odd if and only if  $n$  is odd.  
21. even.  
23. For  $S_{6}$  , the possible orders are 1,2,3,4,5,6; for  $A_{6}$  1,2,3,4,5; for  $A_7$  1,2,3,4,5,6,7.  
25. Since  $|\beta| = 21$ , we have  $n = 16$ .  
27. Suppose  $H$  contains at least one odd permutation,  $\sigma$ . Imitate the proof of Theorem 5.7 with  $\sigma$  in place of (12).  
29. The identity is even; the set is not closed.  
31.  $(8\cdot 7\cdot 6\cdot 5\cdot 4\cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 1) / (2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 4!)$  
33. In  $A_6$  elements of order 2 in disjoint cycle form must be the product of two 2-cycles. So the number of elements of order 2 is  $6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 / (2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2)$ .  
35. Since  $|x^5| = 5$ , we know  $|x| = 25$ . One solution is  $(1,6,7,8,9,2,10,11,12,13,3,14,15,16,17,4,18,19,20,21,$

39. In  $S_7, \beta = (2457136)$ . In  $S_9$ ,  $\beta = (2457136)$  or  $\beta = (2457136)(89)$ .  
41. Since  $|(a_{1}a_{2}a_{3}a_{4})(a_{5}a_{6})| = 4$  such an  $x$  would have order 8. But the elements in  $S_{10}$  of order 8 are 8-cycles or the disjoint product of 8-cycle and a 2-cycle. In both cases the square of such an element is the product of two 4-cycles.  
43. Let  $\alpha, \beta \in \operatorname{stab}(a)$ . Then
\[
\begin{array}{l}
\alpha \beta(a) = \alpha(\beta(a)) = \alpha(a) = a. \text{Also,} \\
\alpha(a) = a \text{ implies } \alpha^{-1}(\alpha(a)) = \alpha^{-1}(a) \text{ or }
\end{array}
\]
 $a = \alpha^{-1}(a)$ .  
45. The Finite Subgroup Test shows that  $H$  is a subgroup.  $|H| = 2(n - 2)!$ .  
47. The first part follows directly from Corollary 3 of Theorem 4.2. For the second part look at (123456).  
49. Let  $\alpha = (123)$  and  $\beta = (145)$ .  
51. (123)(12)  $\neq$  (12)(123) in  $S_{n}(n\geq 3)$  
53. An even number of 2-cycles followed by an even number of 2-cycles gives an even number of 2-cycles in all. So the Finite Subgroup Test is verified.

57.  $R_0,R_{180},H,V$  
59. The permutation corresponding to the rotation of  $360 / n$  degrees,  $(1,2,\dots,n)$  , is an even permutation so all rotations are even. Labeling consecutive vertices of a regular 5-gon 1,2,3,4,5 the even permutation (14)(23)(5) is the reflection that fixes 5 and switches vertices 1 and 4 and 2 and 3. Multiplying the  $n$  rotations by this reflection yields all  $n$  reflections. There is no reflection in  $D_{7}$  since their disjoint cycle form is a 1-cycle and three 2-cycles, which is an odd permutation.  
61. Since  $(1234)^{2}$  is in  $B_{n}$ , it is non-empty. If  $\alpha = \alpha_{1}\alpha_{2}\dots \alpha_{i}$  and  $\beta = \beta_{1}\beta_{2}\dots \beta_{j}$  where  $i$  and  $j$  are even and all the  $\alpha$ 's and  $\beta$ 's are 4-cycles, then  $\alpha \beta = \alpha_{1}\alpha_{2}\dots \alpha_{i}\beta_{1}\beta_{2}\dots \beta_{j}$  is the product of  $i + j$  4-cycles and  $i + j$  is even. So, by the finite subgroup test,  $B_{n}$  is a subgroup. To show that  $B_{n}$  is a subgroup of  $A_{n}$ , note that 4-cycles are odd permutations and the product of any two odd permutations is even. So, for the product of any even number of 4-cycles

the product of the first two 4-cycles is even, then the product of the next two 4-cycles is even, and so on. This proves that  $B_{n}$  is a subgroup of  $A_{n}$ .

63. The product of an element from  $Z(A_4)$  of order 2 and an element of  $A_4$  of order 3 would have order 6. But  $A_4$  has no element of order 6.  
65. Cycle decomposition shows that any nonidentity element of  $A_{5}$  is a 5-cycle, a 3-cycle, or a product of a pair of disjoint 2-cycles. Then, observe that there are  $(5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1) / 5 = 24$  group elements of the form  $(abcde)$ ,  $(5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3) / 3 = 20$  group elements of the form  $(abc)$ , and  $(5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2) / (2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2) = 15$  group elements of the form  $(ab)(cd)$ .  
67. If  $\alpha$  has odd order  $k$  and  $\alpha$  is an odd permutation, then  $\epsilon = \alpha^k$  would be odd.  
69. Since  $|\alpha|$  is the least common multiple of disjoint cycles lengths of  $\alpha$ , let the distinct disjoint cycle lengths be  $\alpha$  be  $n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k$ . Because  $n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k$  are integers between 1 and  $n$ , each of them appears as a term in  $n!$ .  
71. Verifying that  $a*\sigma (b)\neq b*\sigma (a)$  is done by examining all cases. To prove the general case, observe that  $\sigma^i (a)*\sigma^{i + 1}(b)\neq \sigma^i (b)*\sigma^{i + 1}(a)$  can be written in the form  $\sigma^i (a)*\sigma (\sigma^i (b))\neq \sigma^i (b)*\sigma (\sigma^1 (a))$  , which is the case already done. If a transposition were not detected, then  $\sigma (a_{1})*\dots *\sigma^{i}(a_{i})*\sigma^{i + 1}(a_{i + 1})*\dots *\sigma^{n}(a_{n}) =$ $\sigma (a_1)*\dots *\sigma^i (a_{i + 1})*\sigma^{i + 1}(a_i)*\dots *\sigma^n (a_n),$  which implies

$$
\sigma^ {i} \left(a _ {i}\right) * \sigma^ {i + 1} \left(a _ {i + 1}\right) = \sigma^ {i} \left(a _ {i + 1}\right) * \sigma^ {i + 1} \left(a _ {i}\right).
$$

73. By Theorem 5.4 it is enough to prove that every 2-cycle can be expressed as a product of elements of the form  $(1k)$ . To this end, observe that if  $a \neq 1, b \neq 1$ , then  $(ab) = (1a)(1b)(1a)$ .

1. Property 1: Because  $\phi$  is 1-1 and onto, so is  $\phi^{-1}$ . Moreover,  $\phi^{-1}(\phi(a)\phi(b)) =$

$\phi^{-1}(\phi(ab)) = ab = \phi^{-1}(\phi(a))\phi^{-1}(\phi(b))$ .  
Property 4:  $\phi(e) = e$  is in  $\phi(K)$ , so  $\phi(K)$  is not empty. Also,  $\phi(a), \phi(b) \in \phi(K)$  implies that  $\phi(a)\phi(b)^{-1} = \phi(a)\phi(b^{-1}) = \phi(ab^{-1}) \in \phi(K)$ .  
3.  $\phi(xy) = \sqrt{xy} = \sqrt{x}\sqrt{y} = \phi(x)\phi(y)$ .  
5. The mapping  $\phi (x) = (3 / 2)x$  is an isomorphism from  $G$  onto  $H$  Multiplication is not preserved since  $\phi (4) = 6$  but  $\phi (2)\phi (2) = 3\cdot 3 = 9$  .When  $G = \langle m\rangle$  and  $H = \langle n\rangle$  the mapping  $\phi (x) = (n / m)x$  is an isomorphism from  $G$  onto  $H$  
7.  $D_{12}$  has an element of order 12 and  $S_{4}$  does not;  $D_{12}$  has an element of order 6 and  $S_{4}$  does not;  $D_{12}$  has exactly 2 elements of order 4 and  $S_{4}$  has more than 2;  $|Z(D_6)| = 2$  whereas  $|Z(S_4)| = 1$  
9. Since  $T_{e}(x) = ex = x$  for all  $x, T_{e}$  is the identity. For the second part, observe that  $T_{g} \circ (T_{g})^{-1} = T_{e} = T_{gg^{-1}} = T_{g} \circ T_{g^{-1}}$  and cancel.  
11.  $3\overline{a} - 2\overline{b}$ .  
13. For any  $x$  in the group, we have  $(\phi_g\phi_h)(x) = \phi_g(\phi_h(x)) = \phi_g(hxh^{-1}) = ghxh^{-1}g^{-1} = (gh)x(gh)^{-1} = \phi_{gh}(x)$  
15.  $\phi_{R_{90}}$  and  $\phi_{R_0}$  disagree on  $H$ ;  $\phi_{R_{90}}$  and  $\phi_H$  disagree on  $R_{90}$ ;  $\phi_{R_{90}}$  and  $\phi_D$  disagree on  $R_{90}$ . The remaining cases are similar.  
17. Let  $\alpha \in \operatorname{Aut}(G)$ . We show that  $\alpha^{-1}$  is operation-preserving:  $\alpha^{-1}(xy) = \alpha^{-1}(x)\alpha^{-1}(y)$  if and only if  $\alpha(\alpha^{-1}(xy)) = \alpha(\alpha^{-1}(x)\alpha^{-1}(y))$ , that is, if and only if  $xy = \alpha(\alpha^{-1}(x))\alpha(\alpha^{-1}(y)) = xy$ . So  $\alpha^{-1}$  is operation-preserving. That  $\operatorname{Inn}(G)$  is a group follows from the equation  $\phi_g\phi_h = \phi_{gh}$ .  
19. Note that for  $n > 1$ ,  $(\phi_a)^n = (\phi_a)^{n - 1}\phi_a$  so an induction argument gives  $(\phi_{a})^{n} = (\phi_{a})^{n - 1})\phi_{a} = \phi_{a^{n - 1}}\phi_{a}$ . Thus  $(\phi_{a^{n - 1}}\phi_a)(x) = \phi_{a^{n - 1}}(\phi_a(x)) = \phi_{a^{n - 1}}(\phi_a(x)) = \phi_{a^{n - 1}}(axa^{-1}) = a^{n - 1}(axa^{-1})(a^{n - 1})^{-1} = a^{n - 1}(axa^{-1})(a^{-n + 1}) = a^n xa^{-n} = \phi_{a^n}(x)$ . To handle the case where  $n$  is negative we note that  
$\phi_{e} = \phi_{a^{n}a^{-n}} = \phi_{a^{n}}\phi_{a^{-n}} = \phi_{a^{n}}(\phi_{a})^{-n}$  (because  $-n$  is positive). Solving for  $\phi_{a^n}$  we obtain  $\phi_{a^n} = (\phi_a)^n$

21. Since  $b = \phi(a) = a\phi(1)$ , it follows that  $\phi(1) = a^{-1}b$  and therefore  $\phi(x) = a^{-1}bx$ . [Here  $a^{-1}$  is the multiplicative inverse of  $a \mod n$ , which exists because  $a \in U(n)$ .]  
23. Note that both  $H$  and  $K$  are isomorphic to the group of all permutations on four symbols, which is isomorphic to  $S_{4}$ . The same is true when 5 is replaced by  $n$ , since both  $H$  and  $K$  are isomorphic to  $S_{n - 1}$ .  
25. Recall that, when  $n$  is even,  $Z(D_{n}) = \{R_{0}, R_{180}\}$ . Since  $R_{180}$  and  $\phi(R_{180})$  are not the identity and belong to  $Z(D_{n})$ , they must be equal.  
27.  $Z_{60}$ ;  $D_{60}$  
29. See Example 16 of Chapter 2.  
31. That  $\alpha$  is one-to-one follows from the fact that  $r^{-1}$  exists modulo  $n$ . The operation-preserving condition is Exercise 11 in Chapter 0.  
33. By Part 1 of Theorem 6.2, we have  $\phi (a^n) = \phi (a)^n = \gamma (a)^n = \gamma (a^n)$  thus  $\phi$  and  $\gamma$  agree on all elements of  $\langle a\rangle$  
35. First observe that because  $2^{5} = 10 = -1$  we have  $|2| = 10$ . So, by parts 4 and 2 of Theorem 6.1, the mapping that takes  $\phi(x) = 2^x$  is an isomorphism.  
37.  $T_{g}(x) = T_{g}(y)$  if and only if  $gx = gy$  or  $x = y$ . This shows that  $T_{g}$  is a one-to-one function. Let  $y \in G$ . Then  $T_{g}(g^{-1}y) = y$ , so that  $T_{g}$  is onto.  
39. Apply the appropriate definitions.  
41. See Exercise 43 in Chapter 4.  
43. Try  $a + bi \rightarrow \begin{bmatrix} a & -b \\ b & a \end{bmatrix}$ .  
45. Yes, by Cayley's Theorem.  
47. Observe that  $\phi_g(y) = ggy^{-1}$  and  $\phi_{zg}(y) = zgy(zg)^{-1} = zgyg^{-1}z^{-1} =$ $gyg^{-1}$  since  $z\in Z(G)$ . So,  $\phi_g = \phi_{zg}$  
49.  $\phi_g = \phi_h$  implies  $gxg^{-1} = hxh^{-1}$  for all  $x$ . This implies  $h^{-1}gx(h^{-1}g)^{-1} = x$ , and therefore  $h^{-1}g \in Z(G)$ .  
51. By Exercise 49  $\phi_{\alpha} = \phi_{\beta}$  implies  $\beta^{-1}\alpha$  is in  $Z(S_{n})$  and by Exercise 70 in Chapter 5,  $Z(S_{n}) = \{\epsilon \}$ .  
53. Since both  $\phi$  and  $\gamma$  take  $e$  to itself,  $H$  is not empty. Assume  $a$  and  $b$  belong to  $H$ . Then  $\phi(ab^{-1}) = \phi(a)\phi(b^{-1}) = \phi(a)\phi(b)^{-1} = \gamma(a)\gamma(b)^{-1} = \gamma(a)\gamma(b^{-1}) = \gamma(ab^{-1})$ . Thus,  $ab^{-1}$  is in  $H$ .

55. Two of many are  $(12)H(12) =$ $\{(1),(235),(253),(16)(35),(16)(23),$ $(16)(25)\} ;(123)H(123)^{-1} = \{(1),(152),$ $(125),(15)(36),(25)(36),(12)(36)\}$  
57. Since  $-1$  is the unique element of  $\mathbf{C}^*$  of order 2,  $\phi(-1) = -1$ . Since  $i$  and  $-i$  are the only elements of  $\mathbf{C}^*$  of order 4,  $\phi(i) = i$  or  $-i$ .  
59.  $Z_{120},D_{60},S_5$  .  $Z_{120}$  is Abelian, the other two are not.  $D_{60}$  has an element of order 60 and  $S_{5}$  does not.  
61. For the first part use  $D = R_{90}V$  and  $H = R_{90}D$ . For the second part use  $H = R_{180}V$ .  
63.  $T_{R_{90}} = (R_0R_{90}R_{180}R_{270})(HD'VD)$  
65. The first statement follows from the fact that every element of  $D_{n}$  has the form  $(R_{360 / n})^i$  or  $(R_{360 / n})^i F$ . Because  $\alpha$  must map an element of order  $n$  to an element of order  $n$ $R_{360 / n}$  must map to  $(R_{360 / n})^i$  where  $i\in U(n)$ . Moreover,  $F$  must map to a reflection (see Exercise 20). Thus we have at most  $n|U(n)|$  choices.  
67. In both cases  $H$  is isomorphic to the set of all even permutations of the set of four integers so it is isomorphic to  $A_4$ .  
69. Consider the mapping  $\phi (x) = x^2$  and note that 2 is not in the image.  
71. Use the fact that if  $a > 0$ , then  $a = \sqrt{a} \sqrt{a}$ . For the second part, use the first part together with the fact that the inverse of an automorphism is an automorphism.  
73. Say  $\phi$  is an isomorphism from  $Q$  to  $R^{+}$  and  $\phi$  takes 1 to  $a$ . It follows that the integer  $r$  maps to  $a^r$ . Then  $a = \phi(1) = \phi(s \frac{1}{s}) = \phi(\frac{1}{s} + \dots + \frac{1}{s}) = \phi(\frac{1}{s})^s$  and therefore  $a^{\frac{1}{s}} = \phi(\frac{1}{s})$ . Thus the rational  $r/s$  maps to  $a^{r/s}$ . But  $a^{r/s} \neq a^\pi$  for any rational number  $r/s$ .  
75. Send each even permutation in  $S_{n}$  to itself. Send each odd permutation  $\alpha$  in  $S_{n}$  to  $(n + 1,n + 2)\alpha$ . This does not contradict Theorem 5.5 because the subgroup is merely isomorphic to  $A_{n + 2}$ , not the same as  $A_{n + 2}$ . In particular, this example shows that an isomorphism from one permutation group to another permutation group need not preserve oddness.

5. For  $\langle a^5\rangle$  there are 5:  $\langle a^5\rangle ,a\langle a^5\rangle$ $a^2\langle a^5\rangle ,a^3\langle a^5\rangle ,a^4\langle a^5\rangle .$  By Corollary 2 of Theorem 4.2, for  $\langle a^4\rangle = \langle a^2\rangle$  there are two left cosets:  $\langle a^2\rangle ,a\langle a^2\rangle$  
7. Suppose that  $H \neq \langle 3 \rangle$ . Let  $a \in H$  but  $a$  not in  $\langle 3 \rangle$ . Then  $a + \langle 3 \rangle = 1 + \langle 3 \rangle$  or  $a + \langle 3 \rangle = 2 + \langle 3 \rangle$ . If  $a + \langle 3 \rangle = 1 + \langle 3 \rangle$  then  $1 \in H$  and  $H = Z$ . If  $a + \langle 3 \rangle = 2 + \langle 3 \rangle$  then both 2 and 3 belong to  $H$  and therefore  $3 - 2 = 1$  belongs to  $H$ .  
9. Let  $ga$  belong to  $g(H \cap K)$ , where  $a$  is in  $H \cap K$ . Then by definition  $ga$  is in  $gH \cap gK$ . Now let  $x \in gH \cap gK$ . Then  $x = gh$  for some  $h \in H$ , and  $x = gk$  for some  $k \in K$ . Cancellation then gives  $h = k$ . Thus,  $x \in g(H \cap K)$ .  
11. Suppose that  $h \in H$  and  $h < 0$ . Then  $h\mathbf{R}^{+} \subseteq hH = H$ . But  $h\mathbf{R}^{+}$  is the set of all negative real numbers. Thus,  $H = \mathbf{R}^{*}$ .

15. Use Lagrange's Theorem (Theorem 7.1) and Corollary 3.  
17. By Exercise 16, we have  $5^{6} \bmod 7 = 1$ . So, using mod 7, we have  $5^{15} = 5^{6} \cdot 5^{6} \cdot 5^{2} \cdot 5 = 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 6; 7^{13} \bmod 11 = 2$ .  
19. Use Corollary 4 of Lagrange's Theorem (Theorem 7.1) together with Theorem 0.2.  
21. If  $n$  is even, let  $F$  be any reflection in  $D_{n}$ . Then the set  $\{R_{0}, R_{180}, F, FR_{180}\}$  is closed and therefore a subgroup of order 4. Now suppose that  $D_{n}$  has a subgroup  $K$  of order 4. Then, by Lagrange, 4 divides  $2n$ .  
23. Since  $G$  has odd order, no element can have order 2. Thus, for each  $x \neq e$ , we know that  $x \neq x^{-1}$ . So, we can write the product of all the elements in the form  $ea_1a_1^{-1}a_2a_2^{-1} \cdots a_na_n^{-1} = e$ .  
25. Let  $e \neq g \in G$ . Then  $|g| = 5$  or 25. If  $|g| = 25$  for some  $g$ , then  $G$  is cyclic. If

there is no such  $g$ , then  $|g| = 1$  or 5 for all  $g$ .

27. Let  $G$  be a group of order 77. If  $G$  is cyclic, then by Theorem 4.3,  $G$  has exactly one subgroup of order 7 and exactly one of order 11. If  $G$  is not cyclic, by Lagrange, its 76 non-identity elements have orders 7 or 11. By Corollary of Theorem 4.4,  $G$  has at most 72 elements of order 6 and therefore must have elements of order 11, which come 10 at a time. Theorem 7.2 shows that  $G$  cannot have more than one subgroup of order 11, so there are exactly 66 elements of order 7. Because any two of them overlap in  $\{e\}$ , there are 11 subgroups of order 7.  
29. If the group is cyclic Theorem 4.3 says that it has exactly one subgroup of order 5. So, assume the group is not cyclic. Not all of the 54 nonidentity elements can have order 5 because the number of elements of order 5 is a multiple of  $\phi(5) = 4$ . So the group has an element of order 11. Also since  $\phi(11) = 10$  the number of elements of order 11 is a multiple of 10. If there were more than 10 the group would have distinct subgroups  $H$  and  $K$  of order 11. But then  $|HK| = |H||K| / |H \cap K| = 121$ . So, excluding the subgroup of order 11, there are 44 elements remaining and each has order 5. That gives us exactly 11 subgroups of order 5.  
31. By Lagrange's Theorem every element in  $G$  has an order that is a divisor of  $n$ . So, we can partition the  $n$  elements of  $G$  according to their orders. For each divisor  $d$  of  $n$  let  $m_d$  be the number of elements in  $G$  of order  $d$ . By our assumption  $m_d$  is  $\phi(d)$  where  $\phi$  is the Euler phi function. (If there were more than  $\phi(d)$  elements of order  $d$  in  $G$  then  $G$  would have at least 2 subgroups of order  $d$ .) So  $n = \Sigma m_d$  where  $d$  ranges over all divisors  $d$  of  $n$ . We also have from Exercise 87 of Chapter 4 that  $n = \Sigma \phi(d)$  where  $d$  ranges over all divisors  $d$  of  $n$ . This proves that each  $m_d = \phi(d)$ . In particular,  $m_n \neq 0$ .  
33. Suppose that  $H$  and  $K$  are distinct subgroups of order  $m$ . Then  $|HK| = |H||K| = \frac{m \cdot m}{|H \cap K|} \leq 2m$  and

therefore  $\frac{m}{2} \leq |H \cap K|$ . Since  $m$  is odd and  $H$  are  $K$  are distinct we know that  $\frac{m}{2} < |H \cap K| < m$  and that  $|H \cap K|$  divides  $m$ . This is impossible.

35. Observe that  $|G:H| = |G| / |H|$ ,  $|G:K| = |G| / |K|$ , and  $|K:H| = |K| / |H|$ .  
37. Since the reflections in a dihedral group have order 2, the generators of the subgroups of orders 12 and 20 must be rotations. The smallest rotation subgroup of a dihedral group that contains rotations of orders 12 and 20 must have order divisible by 12 and 20 and therefore must be a multiple of 60. So,  $D_{60}$  is the smallest such dihedral group.  
39. Let  $a$  be an element of the group with  $a \neq e$ . Then  $|a| = 2$  or the order of  $a$  is divisible by 3. In the latter case,  $\langle a \rangle$  has an element of order 3 So, we may assume that the group has 17 elements of order 2. This,  $x = x^{-1}$  for all  $x$  in the group. Thus, for every elements  $a$  and  $b$  we have that  $ab = (ab)^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1} = ba$ . Thus the group is Abelian. But then if  $a$  and  $b$  are distinct elements of order 2, we have the  $\{e, a, b, ab\}$  is a subgroup of order 4, which contradicts Lagrange. This proof works when 3 is replaced by any odd prime.  
41. By Corollary 5 of Theorem 7.1, the statement is true for  $n = 1$ . For the sake of induction assume that  $a^{p^k} = a$ . Then  $a^{p^{k + 1}} = a^{p^k}a^p = a^p = a$  
43. Let  $a \in G$  and  $|a| = 5$ . Then the set  $\langle a \rangle H$  has exactly  $5 \cdot |H| / \langle a \rangle \cap H|$  elements and  $|\langle a \rangle \cap H|$  divides  $|\langle a \rangle| = 5$ . It follows that  $|\langle a \rangle \cap H| = 5$  and therefore  $\langle a \rangle \cap H = \langle a \rangle$ .  
45. First observe that by Corollary 2 of Lagrange's Theorem every positive integer  $k$  with the property that  $x^{k} = e$  for all  $x$  in  $G$  is a common multiple of orders of all the elements in  $G$ . So,  $d$  is the least common multiple of the orders of the elements of  $G$ . Since  $|G|$  is a common multiple of the orders of all the elements of  $G$  it follows directly from the division algorithm (Theorem 0.1) that  $|G|$  is divisible by  $d$ .  
47. Let  $G$  be a finite Abelian group. The case  $G$  has 0 or 1 element of order 2 corresponds to the cases  $n = 0$  and

$n = 1$  .Let  $H = \{x\in G\mid x^2 = e\}$  .Then  $H$  is a subgroup of  $G$  that consists of the identity and all elements of order 2. It suffices to prove  $|H| = 2^{n}$  .If  $G$  has at least two elements of order 2, denote them by  $a_1$  and  $b$  . Then  $H_{1} = \{e,a_{1},b,a_{1}b\}$  is a subgroup of order  $2^{2}$  . If  $H_{1} = H$  , we are done. If not, let  $a_2\in H$  but not in  $H_{1}$  . Then  $H_{2} = H_{1}\cup \langle a_{2}\rangle H_{1}$  is a subgroup of  $H$  of order  $2|H_{1}| = 2^{3}$  .If  $H_{2} = H$  we are done. If not, let  $a_3\in H$  but not in  $H_{2}$  and let  $H_{3} = H_{2}\cup \langle a_{3}\rangle H_{2}$  .We can continue this argument until we reach  $H$

49. Consider the mapping from  $G$  to  $G$  defined by  $\phi (x) = x^2$  and let  $|G| = 2k + 1$ . Use the observation that  $x = xe = xx^{2k + 1} = x^{2k + 2} = (x^{2})^{k + 1}$  to prove that  $\phi$  is one-to-one and Exercise 13 of Chapter 5 to show that  $\phi$  is onto.  
51. If  $H$  and  $K$  are distinct subgroups of order  $p^m$  then  $np^m = |G| \geq |HK| = |H||K| / |H \cap K| \geq p^m p^m / p^{m-1} = pp^m$ , which is obviously false.  
53. Let  $G$  be the group and  $H$  the unique subgroup of order  $q$ . We must show that  $G$  has an element of order  $pq$ . Let  $a$  belong to  $G$  but not in  $H$ . By Lagrange,  $|a| = p$  or  $pq$ . If  $|a| = pq$  we are done. So, we may assume that  $a$  has order  $p$  and we let  $K = \langle a \rangle$ . Then  $H \cup K$  accounts for  $q + p - 1$  elements (the identity appears twice). Pick  $b \in G$  but  $b$  not one of the elements in  $H \cup K$ . Then  $L = \langle b \rangle$  is a subgroup of  $G$  of order  $p$  different than  $K$ . Then  $K \cap L = \{e\}$  because  $|K \cap L|$  must divide  $p$  and is not  $p$ . By Theorem 7.2  $|KL| = |K||L| / |K \cap L| = (p \cdot p) / 1 = p^2$ . But a group of order  $pq$  with  $q < p$  cannot have  $p^2$  elements. This shows that  $b$  cannot have order  $p$ . So  $|b| = pq$ .  
55. Use Theorem 7.2.  
57. 50  
59. Let  $K$  be the set of all even permutations in  $H$ . Since  $K$  is closed it is a subgroup of  $H$ . If  $K = H$ , we are done. If not, let  $\alpha$  be an element in  $H$  that is odd. Then  $\alpha K$  must be the set of all odd permutations in  $H$ , for if  $\beta$  is any odd permutation in  $H$ , we have  $\alpha^{-1}\beta \in H$ , which means  $\beta \in H$ . Thus  $|H| = |K \cup \alpha K| = 2|K|$ .

61. Suppose that  $H$  is a subgroup of  $A_{5}$  of order 30. We claim that  $H$  contains all 20 elements of  $A_{5}$  that have order 3. To verify this, assume that there is some  $\alpha$  in  $A_{5}$  of order 3 that is not in  $H$ . Then  $A_{5} = H \cup \alpha H$ . It follows that  $\alpha^{2}H = H$  or  $\alpha^{2} = \alpha H$ . Since the latter implies that  $\alpha \in H$ , we have that  $\alpha^{2}H = H$ , which implies that  $\alpha^{2} \in H$ . But then  $\langle \alpha \rangle = \langle \alpha^{2} \rangle \subseteq H$ , which is a contradiction of our assumption that  $\alpha$  is not in  $H$ . The same argument, shows that  $H$  must contain all 24 elements of order 5. Since  $|H| = 30$ , we have a contradiction.  
63. Say  $H$  is a subgroup of order 30. By Exercise 61  $H$  is not a subgroup of  $A_{5}$  and by Exercise 59  $H \cap A_{5}$  is a subgroup of  $A_{5}$  of order 15. But this contradicts Exercise 62.  
65. If  $H$  is a subgroup of  $S_{5}$  of order 60 other than  $A_{5}$ , then it follows from Theorem 7.2 that  $|A_{5} \cap H| = 30$ , which contradicts Exercise 61.  
67. Certainly,  $a\in \mathrm{orb}_G(a)$  . Now suppose that  $c\in \operatorname {orb}_G(a)\cap \operatorname {orb}_G(b)$  . Then  $c = \alpha (a)$  and  $c = \beta (b)$  for some  $\alpha$  and  $\beta$  and therefore  $(\beta^{-1}\alpha)(a) = b$  . So, if  $x\in \mathrm{orb}_G(b)$  , then  $x = \gamma (b) = (\gamma \beta^{-1}\alpha)(a)$  for some  $\gamma$  . This proves that  $\operatorname {orb}_G(b)\subseteq \operatorname {orb}_G(a)$  . By symmetry,  $\operatorname {orb}_G(a)\subseteq \operatorname {orb}_G(b)$  
69. a.  $\operatorname{stab}_G(1) = \{(1), (24)(56)\}$ ;  $\operatorname{orb}_G(1) = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$   
b.  $\operatorname{stab}_G(3) = \{(1), (24)(56)\}$ ;  $\operatorname{orb}_G(3) = \{3, 4, 1, 2\}$   
c.  $\operatorname{stab}_G(5) = \{(1), (12)(34)\}$ ,  $(13)(24), (14)(23)\}$ ;  $\operatorname{orb}_G(5) = \{5, 6\}$  
71. Suppose that  $B \in G$  and  $\operatorname{det}(B) = 2$ . Then  $\operatorname{det}(A^{-1}B) = 1$ , so that  $A^{-1}B \in H$  and therefore  $B \in AH$ . Conversely, for any  $Ah \in AH$  we have  $\operatorname{det}(Ah) = (\operatorname{det}(A))(\operatorname{det}(B)) = 2 \cdot 1 = 2$ .  
73. It is the set of all permutations that carry face 2 to face 1.  
75.  $aH = bH$  if and only if det  $(a) = \pm \operatorname{det}(b)$ .  
77. Closure of the set follows from using  $\alpha \beta^2 = \beta^2\beta^3$

1. Closure and associativity in the product follow from the closure and associativity in each component. The identity in the product is the  $n$ -tuple with the identity in each component. The inverse of  $(g_1, g_2, \ldots, g_n)$  is  $(g_1^{-1}, g_2^{-1}, \ldots, g_n^{-1})$ .

11. There are 12 elements of order 4. Observe by Theorem 4.4 that as long as  $d$  divides  $n$ , the number of elements of order  $d$  in a cyclic group depends only on  $d$ . So, in both  $Z_{8000000}$  and  $Z_4$  there are  $\phi(4) = 2$  elements of order 4 and  $\phi(2) = 1$  element of order 2. Similarly for  $Z_m \oplus Z_n$ .

37. Compare the number of elements of order 2 in each group.  
39. The mapping  $\phi(3^m 6^n) = (m, n)$  is an isomorphism. The mapping  $\phi(3^m 9^n) = (m, n)$  is not well-defined, since  $\phi(3^2 9^0) \neq \phi(3^0 9^1)$ .  
41. In both cases they are the same.  
43.  $\mathbf{C}^*$  has only one element of order 2 whereas  $Z_{m}\oplus Z_{n}$  has exactly one element of order 2 if and only if it is cyclic, which is true if and only if  $\gcd (m,n) = 1$

51. For part a, there are  $\phi (18) = 6$  . Two are  $\phi (x) = (x,x)$  and  $\phi (x) = (x,2x)$  .For part b, there are none because  $Z_{2}\oplus Z_{3}\oplus Z_{3}$  is not cyclic.  
53. Since (2, 0) has order 2, it must map to an element in  $Z_{12}$  of order 2. The only such element in  $Z_{12}$  is 6. The isomorphism defined by (1, 1)  $x \to 5x$  with  $x = 6$  takes (2, 0) to 6. Since (1, 0) has order 4, it must map to an element in  $Z_{12}$  of order 4. The only such elements in  $Z_{12}$  are 3 and 9. The first case occurs for the isomorphism defined by (1, 1)  $x \to 7x$  with  $x = 9$  [recall that (1, 1) is a generator of  $Z_4 \oplus Z_3$ ; the second case occurs for the isomorphism defined by (1, 1)  $x \to 5x$  with  $x = 9$ .  
55. Since  $a \in Z_m$  and  $b \in Z_n$ , we know that  $|a|$  divides  $m$  and  $|b|$  divides  $n$ . So,  $|(a,b)| = \operatorname{lcm}(|a|, |b|)$  divides  $\operatorname{lcm}(m,n)$ .  
57.  $Z,Z_{3},Z_{4},Z_{6}$  
59. Observe that every nonidentity element of  $Z_{p} \oplus Z_{p}$  has order  $p$  and each subgroup of order  $p$  contains  $p - 1$  of them. So, there are exactly  $(p^2 - 1) / (p - 1) = p + 1$  subgroups of order  $p$ .  
61. Look at  $Z \oplus Z_2$ .  
63.  $U(165)\approx U(11)\oplus U(15)\approx U(5)\oplus U(33)\approx$ $U(3)\oplus U(55)\approx U(3)\oplus U(5)\oplus U(11)$

65.  $U(2n)\approx U(2)\oplus U(n) = \{1\} \oplus U(n)\approx$ $U(n)$  
67. Mimic the analysis for elements of order 12 in  $U(105)$  in this chapter. The number is 14.  
69.  $A_4 \oplus Z_4$  has exactly 7 elements of order 2 whereas  $D_{12} \oplus Z_2$  has more.  
71. Observe that  $D_{5} \oplus Z_{2} \oplus Z_{2}$  has 23 elements of order 2 whereas  $D_{20}$  has 21.  
73. Observe that  $U(55)$  and  $U(75)$  are both isomorphic to  $Z_{4} \oplus Z_{10}$  and  $U(144)$  and  $U(140)$  are both isomorphic to  $Z_{2} \oplus Z_{4} \oplus Z_{6}$ .  
75. From Theorem 6.5 we know  $\operatorname{Aut}(Z_n) \approx U(n)$ . So,  $n = 8$  and 12 are the two smallest.  
77. Since  $U(pq)\approx U(p)\oplus U(q)\approx Z_{p - 1}\oplus Z_{q - 1}$  if follows that  $k = \operatorname {lcm}(p - 1,q - 1)$  
79.  $Z_{p^{n - 1}}$  
81.  $U_{8}(40)\approx U(5)\approx Z_{4}$  
83.  $U_{5}(140)\approx U(28)$ $U_{4}(140)\approx U(35)\approx Z_{4}\oplus Z_{6}.$  
85. If  $x \in U_{st}(n)$  then  $x \in U(n)$  and  $x - 1 = stm$  for some  $m$ . So,  $x - 1 = s(tm)$  and  $x - 1 = t(sm)$ . If  $x \in U_s(n) \cap U_t(n)$  then  $x \in U(n)$  and both  $s$  and  $t$  divide  $x - 1$ . So, by Exercise 6 in Chapter 0,  $st$  divides  $x - 1$ .  
87.  $Z_{2}\oplus Z_{2}$  
89. Let  $p_1^{n_1}p_2^{n_2}\dots p_k^{n_k}$  be the prime-power decomposition of  $n$ . From the discussion following the corollary of Theorem 9.7, we know that  $U(n)$  is the internal direct product of groups  $U(p_i^{n_i})$  for  $i = 1,2,\ldots ,k$ . For odd  $p_i$ ,  $U(p_i^{n_i})$  is cyclic of even order so  $H$  contains the generator the subgroup isomorphic to  $U(p_i^{n_i})$ . For  $p_i = 2$  every nonidentity element of  $U(p_i^{n_i})$  has even order so  $H$  contains  $U(2^{n_i})$  as well.  
91. Since  $5 \cdot 29 = 1$  mod 36, we have that  $s = 29$ . So, we need to compute  $34^{29}$  mod 2701. The result is 1415, which converts to NO.  
93. Because the block 2505 exceeds the modulus 2263, sending  $2505^{e}$  mod 2263 is the same as sending  $242^{e}$  mod 2263 which decodes as 242 instead of 2505.

1. No.  
3.  $HR_{90} = R_{270}H$ ;  $DR_{270} = R_{90}D$ ;  $R_{90}V = VR_{270}$  
5. Say  $i <   j$  and let  $h\in H_i\cap H_j$  . Then  $h\in H_1H_2\dots H_i\dots H_{j - 1}\cap H_j = \{e\} .$  
7. Recall that if A and B are matrices, then det  $(ABA^{-1}) = (\det A)(\det B)$  (det  $A)^{-1}$  
9. Let  $x \in G$ . If  $x \in H$ , then  $xH = H = Hx$ . If  $x \notin H$ , then  $xH$  is the set of elements in  $G$ , not in  $H$ . But  $Hx$  is also the set of elements in  $G$ , not in  $H$ .  
11. Let  $G = \langle a \rangle$ . Then  $G / H = \langle aH \rangle$  
13. in  $H$  
15.  $|9H| = 2$ ;  $|13H| = 4$ .  
17.  $1 + \langle 3.5\rangle$  
19. Observe that in a group  $G$ , if  $|a| = 2$  and  $\{e, a\}$  is a normal subgroup, then  $xax^{-1} = a$  for all  $x$  in  $G$ . Thus  $a \in Z(G)$ . So, the only normal subgroup of order 2 in  $D_{n}$  is  $\{R_{0}, R_{180}\}$  when  $n$  is even.  
21. Observe that (57) is in  $H$ , whereas (56)(57)(56) sends 6 to 7. Observe that (578) is in  $H$ , whereas (456)(57)(654) sends 6 to 7.  
23. It follows from Theorem 7.2 that  $H$  is the unique subgroup of order  $p$  in  $G$ . Then, since for every  $x$  in  $G$ , we have that  $xHx^{-1}$  is a subgroup of order  $p$ ,  $xHx^{-1} = H$ .  
25.  $Z_{8}$  
27. Yes; no  
29. The subgroups would have orders 2 or 4 and therefore are Abelian. But the internal direct products of Abelian groups are Abelian.  
31. Certainly, every nonzero real number is of the form  $\pm r$ , where  $r$  is a positive real number. Real numbers commute, and  $\mathbf{R}^{+}\cap \{1, - 1\} = \{1\}$  
33. No. If  $G = H \times K$ , then  $|g| = \operatorname{lcm}(|h|, |k|)$ , provided that  $|h|$  and  $|k|$  are finite. If  $|h|$  or  $|k|$  is infinite, so is  $|g|$ .  
35. For the first question, note that  $\langle 3\rangle \cap \langle 6\rangle = \{1\}$  and  $\langle 3\rangle \langle 6\rangle \cap \langle 10\rangle = \{1\}$ .

For the second question, observe that  $12 = 3^{-1}6^{2}$ . So  $\langle 3\rangle \langle 6\rangle \cap \langle 12\rangle \neq \{1\}$ .  
37. Say  $|g| = n$ . Then  $(gH)^n = g^n H = eH = H$ . Now use Corollary 2 to Theorem 4.1.  
39. Let  $x$  be in  $G$  and  $h$  be in  $H$ . Then  $xhx^{-1}H = (xh)x^{-1}H = (xh)Hx^{-1}H = xhHx^{-1}H = xHx^{-1}H = xx^{-1}H = H$ , so  $xhx^{-1}$  belongs to  $H$ .  
41. Suppose that  $H$  is a proper subgroup of  $Q$  of index  $n$ . Then  $Q / H$  is a finite group of order  $n$ . By Corollary 4 of Theorem 7.1, we know that for every  $x$  in  $Q$  we have  $nx$  is in  $H$ . Now observe that the function  $f(x) = nx$  maps  $Q$  onto  $Q$ . So,  $Q \subseteq H$ .  
43. Take  $G = Z_6$ ,  $H = \{0, 3\}$ ,  $a = 1$ , and  $b = 9$ .  
45. Normality follows directly from Theorem 4.3 and Example 7.  
47. In general, if  $p$  is a prime and  $|H| = p^2 m$  and  $|K| = p^2 n$  where  $\gcd(m, n) = 1$ , then  $H \cap K| = 1, p$ , or  $p^2$ . So, by Corollary 3 of Theorem 7.1 and Theorem 9.7,  $H \cap K$  is Abelian.  
49. Use the  $G / Z$  Theorem.  
51. Suppose that  $K$  is a normal subgroup of  $G$  and let  $gH \in G / H$  and  $kH \in K / H$ . Then  $gHkH(gH)^{-1} = gHkHg^{-1}H = gkg^{-1}H \in K / H$ . Now suppose that  $K / H$  is a normal subgroup of  $G / H$  and let  $g \in G$  and  $k \in K$ . Then  $gkg^{-1}H = gHkHg^{-1}H = gHkH(gH)^{-1} \in K / H$  so  $gkg^{-1} \in K$ .  
53. Say  $H$  has index  $n$ . Then  $(\mathbf{R}^{*})^{n} = \{x^{n}\mid x\in \mathbf{R}^{*}\} \subseteq H$ . If  $n$  is odd, then  $(\mathbf{R}^{*})^{n} = \mathbf{R}^{*}$ ; if  $n$  is even, then  $(\mathbf{R}^{*})^{n} = \mathbf{R}^{+}$ . So,  $H = \mathbf{R}^{*}$  or  $H = \mathbf{R}^{+}$ .  
55. Use Exercise 9 and observe that  $VK \neq KV$ .  
57.  $G$  has elements of orders 1, 2, 3, and 6.  
59. Let  $N = \langle a\rangle$ $H = \langle a^k\rangle$  , and  $x$  be in  $G$  Then,  $x(a^{k})^{m}x^{-1} = (xa^{m}x^{-1})^{k} =$ $(a^r)^k = (a^k)^r\in H.$  
61.  $\gcd(|x|, |G / H|) = 1$  implies  $\gcd(|xH|, |G / H|) = 1$ . But  $|xH|$  divides  $|G / H|$ . Thus  $|xH| = 1$  and therefore  $xH = H$ .  
63. Use Example 5 and Lagrange's Theorem.  
65. Observe that for every positive integer  $n$ ,  $(1 + i)^{n}$  is not a real number. So,  $(1 + i)\mathrm{R}^{*}$  has infinite order.

67. Use Theorems 9.4 and 9.3.  
69. Because  $|g| = 16$  implies that  $|gH|$  divides 16 it suffices to show that  $(gH)^4$  is not  $H$ . Suppose that  $(gH)^4 = g^4 H = H$ . Then  $g^4$  is in  $H$ . But then  $e, g^4$ , and  $g^8$  are in  $H$ , which is a contradiction. In the general case, say  $|gH| = k$ . Then  $(gH)^k = g^k H = H$ . So,  $g^k$  is in  $H$  and therefore  $|g^k| = 1$  or 2. It follows that  $k = 2n$  or  $n$ .  
71. Use Theorem 9.3 and Theorem 7.3.  
73. If  $A_{5}$  had a normal subgroup of order 2 then it would have an element of the form  $(ab)(cd)$  that commutes with every element of  $A_{5}$ . Try  $(abc)$ .  
75. By the classification of groups of order  $2p$ -theorem (7.3),  $G / Z(G)$  must be cyclic or isomorphic to  $D_p$ . But the  $G / Z$ -Theorem (9.3) rules out the cyclic case, for otherwise  $G$  would be Abelian and therefore  $G$  would be  $Z(G)$ .  
77. Suppose that  $H$  is a subgroup of order 12 in  $S_{4}$  other than  $A_{4}$ . Then, since  $A_{4}$  is a normal subgroup of  $S_{4}$ ,  $HA_{4}$  is a subgroup of  $S_{4}$  of order greater than 12. So  $HA_{4} = S_{4}$ , and therefore,  $|HA_{4}| = 12 \cdot 12 / |H \cap A_{4}| = 24$ . So,  $|H \cap A_{4}| = 6$ . But, by Example 5 of Chapter 7, we know that  $A_{4}$  has no subgroup of order 6.  
79. Observe that  $153H = 3 \cdot 51H = H$ .  
81. Let  $|gH| = d$  and  $|g| = m$ . We know by Exercise 37 that  $|gH|$  divides  $|g|$  and, because  $g^d \in H$ , we also know that  $|g^d| = m / d$  divides  $|H|$ . This means that  $m / d = 1$ .  
83. By definition, every element of  $G$  can be written in the form  $a_{j_1}a_{j_2}\ldots a_{j_k}$  where  $a_{j_1},a_{j_2},\ldots ,a_{j_k}\in \langle a_1,a_2,\ldots ,a_n\rangle$  . Then  $gH = a_{j_1}Ha_{j_2}H\ldots a_{j_k}H.$  
85. Since  $G$  is Abelian the subgroups  $H_{1}, H_{2}, \ldots, H_{k}$  are normal in  $G$ . By assumption,  $G = H_{1}H_{2}\dots H_{k}$ , So, all that remains to prove is that for all  $i = 2,3,\ldots,k-1$  we have  $H_{1}H_{2}\dots H_{i} \cap H_{i+1} = \{e\}$ . But if  $x \in H_{1}H_{2}\dots H_{i} \cap H_{i+1}$  and  $x \neq e$  then  $x$  can be written in the two distinct forms  $h_{1}h_{2}\dots h_{i}e\cdots e$  ( $k-i$  terms) and  $e\cdots eh_{i+1}e\cdots e$  ( $i$  terms on the left and  $k-(i+1)$  terms on the right) and

each  $h_j \in H_j$ . This contradicts our assumption about  $G$ .

87. We know from Theorem 9.7 that  $G / Z(G) \approx Z_{p^2}$  or  $Z_p \oplus Z_p$  and from the  $G / Z$  Theorem (Theorem 9.3)  $Z_{p^2}$  is ruled out.  
89. By Theorem 7.2 and Example 5 in Chapter 9, if  $H$  and  $K$  were distinct subgroups of order  $p^2$  then  $HK$  would be a subgroup of order  $p^3$  or  $p^4$ , which contradicts Lagrange.  
91. If  $G$  is cyclic then Theorem 4.4 says that  $G$  has exactly one element of order 2. If  $G$  is not cyclic, let  $a$  be any non-identity element of  $G$  and  $b$  be any element of  $G$  not in  $\langle a \rangle$ . Then  $\langle a \rangle \times \langle b \rangle$  is isomorphic to a group of the form  $Z_{2^s} \oplus Z_{2^t}$  where  $s$  and  $t$  are positive. But then  $G$  has at least three elements of order 2. The appropriate generalization is: "An Abelian group of order  $p^n$  for a prime  $p$  and some positive integer  $n$  is cyclic if and only if it has exactly  $p - 1$  elements of order  $p$ ."

3. Note that  $(f + g)' = f' + g'$ .  
5. By property 3 of Theorem 10.1,  $|k|$  divides both  $m$  and  $n$ . Now suppose that  $|k|$  divides both  $m$  and  $n$  and let  $d = \gcd(m, n)$ . Since  $|k|$  divides both  $m$  and  $n$ , it divides  $d$ , and because the subgroup  $\langle n / d \rangle$  has order  $d$ , every element whose order divides  $d$  is contained in  $\langle n / d \rangle$ . So,  $k = tn / d$  for some integer  $t$ . To show that  $\phi$  is well-defined we must show that if  $a = b \mod m$ , then  $ka = kb \mod n$ . Since  $a - b = mq$  for some integer  $q$ , we have  $ka - kb = kmt = (tn / d)mt = tn(m / d)t = 0 \mod n$ . To see why the number of homomorphisms from  $Z_m$  to  $Z_n$  is  $\gcd(m, n)$  observe that the above argument shows that  $k$  yields a

homomorphism if and only if  $k$  is in  $\langle n / d\rangle$  and the order of  $n / d$  is  $d$ .

13.  $(a,b)\to b$  is a homomorphism from  $A\oplus B$  onto  $B$  with kernel  $A\oplus \{e\}$

17. Suppose  $\phi$  is such a homomorphism. By Theorem 10.3,

$\mathrm{Ker}\phi = \langle (8,1)\rangle ,\langle (0,1)\rangle$  or  $\langle (8,0)\rangle$  .In these cases,  $(1,0) + \mathrm{Ker}\phi$  has order either 16 or 8. So,  $(Z_{16}\oplus Z_2) / \mathrm{Ker}\phi$  is not isomorphic to  $Z_{4}\oplus Z_{4}$

19. Since  $|\mathrm{Ker}\phi |$  is not 1 and divides 17,  $\phi$  is the trivial map.

27. For each  $k$  with  $0 \leq k \leq n - 1$ , the mapping  $1 \to k$  determines a homomorphism.

29. Use Theorem 10.3 and properties 5, 7, and 9 of Theorem 10.2.

31. Suppose that the correspondence from  $Z_{m}$  to  $Z_{n}$  given by  $x \to kx$  is a homomorphism. Then, in  $Z_{n}$ , we have  $0 = \phi(0) = \phi(m) = mk$ . So,  $n$  divides  $mk$ . Now suppose  $n$  divides  $mk$ . We first show that  $\phi$  is well-defined. That is, if  $a = b \mod m$ , we must show that

$\phi (a) = \phi (b)$  mod  $n$  . From  $a = b$  mod  $m$  we have  $a - b = mt$  for some integer  $t$  Then,

$\phi (a) - \phi (b) = ka - kb = k(a - b) = kmt = 0$  mod  $n$  .Finally,observe that for  $a$  and  $^b$  in  $Z_{m}$  ,we have that in  $Z_{n}$

$\phi (a + b) = k(a + b) = ka + kb = \phi (a) + \phi (b).$

33. 11Ker  $\phi$

35.  $\phi ((a,b) + (c,d)) = \phi ((a + c,b + d)) =$

$(a + c) - (b + d) = a - b + c - d =$

$\phi ((a,b)) + \phi ((c,d))$

$\operatorname{Ker} \phi = \{(a, a) \mid a \in Z\}$ .

$\phi^{-1}(3) = \{(a + 3,a)\mid a\in Z\} .$

37. Use the property of complex numbers that  $|xy| = |x||y|$  and the First Isomorphism Theorem.

39.  $\phi(xy) = (xy)^6 = x^6y^6 = \phi(x)\phi(y)$ .

$\mathrm{Ker}\phi = \langle 60^{\circ} + i\sin 60^{\circ}\rangle .$

41. Since  $\phi(e) = e = e^{-2}$ ,  $e \in H$ . If  $a \in H$ , then  $\phi(ab) = \phi(a)\phi(b) = a^{-2}b^{-2} = (ab)^{-2} \in H$ . Also,  $\phi(a^{-1}) = \phi(a)^{-1} = (a^{-2})^{-1} = (a^{-1})^{-2} \in H$ . If  $\phi(x) = x^3$  and  $a \in H$ , then  $\phi(a) = a^3 = a^{-2}$  implies that  $a^5 = e$ . Thus,  $|a| = 5$  or  $1$ .

43. Property 2 of Theorem 10.2 handles the  $2^{m}$  case. Suppose that there is a homomorphism from  $G = Z_{2^m} \oplus Z_{2^n}$  onto  $Z_2 \oplus Z_2 \oplus Z_2$  where  $m$  and  $n$  are at least 1 and let  $H$  be the kernel. We may assume that  $m + n \geq 3$ . Then  $|H| = 2^{m + n - 3}$ . Because every nonidentity element of  $G / H$  has order 2 we know that  $((1,0)H)^2 = (2,0)H = H$  and  $((0,1)H)^2 = (0,2)H = H$ . This means that  $H_1 = \langle (2,0) \rangle$  and  $H_2 = \langle (0,2) \rangle$  are subgroups of  $H$ . Then  $H_1H_2$  is also a subgroup of  $H$ . But  $|H_1H_2| = 2^{m - 1} \cdot 2^{n - 1} = 2^{m + n - 2}$  exceeds  $|H| = 2^{m + n - 3}$ . The argument works for any prime  $p$ .

45. Since  $S_4 / H$  is a group of order 6 but has no element of order 6 (because  $S_4$  does not have one) it follows from Theorems 7.3 and 10.3 that  $S_4 / H$  is isomorphic to

47. It follows from Exercise 11 in Chapter 0 that the mapping  $\phi$  from  $U(st)$  to  $U(s)$  given by  $\phi (x) = x$  mod  $s$  is a homomorphism. Since Ker  $\phi = U_{s}(st)$  we have by Theorem 10.3 that  $U(st) / U_s(st)$  is isomorphic to a subgroup of  $U(s)$ . To see that  $\phi$  is onto note that it follows from Theorem 8.3 that  $|U(st) / U_s(st)| = |U(st)| / |U_s(st)| = |U(s)\oplus U(t)| / |U(t)| = |U(s)||U(t)| / |U(t)| = |U(s)|$ .

49. Show that the mapping from  $K$  to  $KN / N$  given by  $k\rightarrow kN$  is an onto homomorphism with kernel  $K\cap N$

51. Since the eight elements of  $A_4$  of order 3 must map to an element of order that divides 3, by Lagrange's Theorem, each of them must map to the identity. But then the kernel has at least 8 elements and its order and divides 12. So, the kernel has order 12.

53.  $D_{4},\{e\} ,Z_{2},Z_{2}\oplus Z_{2}$

55. It is divisible by 10. 10 can be replaced by any positive integer.  
57. It is infinite. Look at  $Z$ .  
59. Let  $\gamma$  be the natural homomorphism from  $G$  onto  $G / N$ . Let  $\overline{H}$  be a subgroup of  $G / N$  and let  $\gamma^{-1}(\overline{H}) = H$ . Then  $H$  is a subgroup of  $G$  and  $H / N = \gamma(H) = \gamma(\gamma^{-1}(\overline{H})) = \overline{H}$ .  
61. The mapping  $g\to \phi_g$  is a homomorphism with kernel  $Z(G)$  
63.  $(f + g)(3) = f(3) + g(3)$ . The kernel is the set of elements in  $Z[x]$  whose graphs pass through the point  $(3,0)$ . 3 can be replaced by any integer.  
65. Let  $g$  belong to  $G$ . Since  $\phi(g)$  belongs to  $Z_{2} \oplus Z_{2} = \langle (1,0) \rangle \cup \langle (0,1) \rangle \cup \langle (1,1) \rangle$ , it follows that  $G = \phi^{-1}(\langle (1,0) \rangle) \cup \phi^{-1}(\langle (0,1) \rangle) \cup \phi^{-1}(\langle (1,1) \rangle)$ . Moreover, each of these three subgroups is proper and by property 9 of Theorem 10.2 normal.  
67.  $\phi (a,b) = (2a,b)$  
69. It fails because 5 does divide  $|\operatorname{Aut}(Z_{11})| = 10$ .  
71. Mimic Example 18.  
73. Let  $\phi$  be a homomorphism from  $S_{3}$  to  $G$ . Since  $|\phi(S_{3})|$  must divide 6, we have that  $|\phi(S_{3})| = 1,2,3$ , or 6. In the first case,  $\phi$  maps every element to 0. If  $|\phi(S_{3})| = 2$ , then  $n$  is even and  $\phi$  maps the even permutations to 0 and the odd permutations to an element of order 2. The case that  $|\phi(S_{3})| = 3$  cannot occur, because it implies that  $\mathrm{Ker} \, \phi$  is a normal subgroup of order 2, whereas  $S_{3}$  has no normal subgroup of order 2. The case that  $|\phi(S_{3})| = 6$  cannot occur, because it implies that  $\phi$  is an isomorphism from a non-Abelian group to an Abelian group.  
75.  $\phi (zw) = z^2 w^2 = \phi (z)\phi (w)$  .Ker  $\phi = \{1, - 1\}$  and, because  $\phi$  is onto  $\mathbf{C}^*$  we have by Theorem 10.3,  $\mathbf{C}^{*} / \{1, - 1\}$  is isomorphic to  $\mathbf{C}^*$  .When  $\mathbf{C}^*$  is replaced by  $\mathbf{R}^*$  we have that  $\phi$  is onto  $\mathbf{R}^{+}$  and by Theorem 10.3,  $\mathbf{R}^{*} / \{1, - 1\}$  is isomorphic to  $\mathbf{R}^{+}$  
77. If a homomorphism  $\phi$  maps 1 to  $k$ , then  $\phi(x) = kx$ . Thus, by property 3 of Theorem 10.1,  $|a|$  must be a divisor of 5. This gives us that the possibilities for  $k$  are 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12. These five possibilities for  $k$  can be checked with

one argument by noting that they all have the form  $3s$  and proceed as in Example 11.

79. First note that by the Classification of Groups of order  $2p$ , where  $p$  is an odd prime (Theorem 7.3), we have that  $S_{3}$  is isomorphic to  $D_{3}$ . By properties of cosets,  $|S_4 / H| = 6$  and by Theorem 7.3, we have that  $S_{4} / H$  is isomorphic to  $Z_{6}$  or  $D_{3}$ . Because the largest order of any element in  $S_{4}$  is 4,  $S_{4} / H$  is isomorphic to  $D_{3}$ .  
81. We know that  $|\phi(1)|$  must divide 24 and 9. So,  $|\phi(1)| = 1$  or 3. This tells us that  $\phi(1) = 0, 3$ , or 6.

1.  $n = 4;Z_4,Z_2\oplus Z_2$  
3.  $n = 36;Z_{9}\oplus Z_{4},Z_{3}\oplus Z_{3}\oplus Z_{4},Z_{9}\oplus Z_{2}\oplus$ $Z_{2},Z_{3}\oplus Z_{3}\oplus Z_{2}\oplus Z_{2}$  
5. The only Abelian groups of order 45 are  $Z_{45}$  and  $Z_{3} \oplus Z_{3} \oplus Z_{5}$ . In the first group,  $|3| = 15$ ; in the second one,  $|(1,1,1)| = 15$ .  $Z_{3} \oplus Z_{3} \oplus Z_{5}$  does not have an element of order 9.  
7.  $Z_{9}\oplus Z_{3}\oplus Z_{4};Z_{9}\oplus Z_{3}\oplus Z_{2}\oplus Z_{2}$  
9.  $Z_{4}\oplus Z_{2}\oplus Z_{3}\oplus Z_{5}$

11. By the Fundamental Theorem, any finite Abelian group  $G$  is isomorphic to some direct product of cyclic groups of prime-power order. Now go across the direct product and, for each distinct prime you have, pick off the largest factor of the prime power. Next, combine all of these into one factor (you can do this, since the subscripts are relatively prime). Let us call the order of this new factor  $n_1$ . Now repeat this process with the remaining original factors and call the order of the resulting factor  $n_2$ . Then  $n_2$  divides  $n_1$ , since each prime-power divisor of  $n_2$  is also a prime-power divisor of  $n_1$ . Continue in this fashion. Example: If  $G \approx Z_{27} \oplus Z_3 \oplus Z_{125} \oplus Z_{25} \oplus Z_4 \oplus Z_2 \oplus Z_2$ , then  $G \approx Z_{27.125.4} \oplus Z_{3.25.2} \oplus Z_2$ . Now note that 2 divides  $3 \cdot 25 \cdot 2$  and  $3 \cdot 25 \cdot 2$  divides  $27 \cdot 125 \cdot 4$ .

13.  $Z_{2}\oplus Z_{2}$

15. a. 1 b. 1 c. 1 d. 1 e. 1 f. There is a unique Abelian group of order  $n$  if and only if  $n$  is not divisible by the square of any prime.  
17. This is equivalent to asking how many Abelian groups of order 16 have no elements of order 8. From the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups the only choices are  $Z_{4} \oplus Z_{4}, Z_{4} \oplus Z_{2} \oplus Z_{2}$ , and  $Z_{2} \oplus Z_{2} \oplus Z_{2} \oplus Z_{2}$ .  
19.  $Z_{2}\oplus Z_{2}$  
21.  $Z_{3}\oplus Z_{3}$  
23.  $n$  is square-free (no prime factor of  $n$  occurs more than once).  
25. Among the first 11 elements in the table, there are nine elements of order 4. None of the other isomorphism classes has this many.  
27.  $Z_{4}\oplus Z_{2}\oplus Z_{2}$  ; one internal direct product is  $\langle 7\rangle \times \langle 101\rangle \times \langle 199\rangle$  
29. Since  $|\langle (2,2)\rangle | = 8$  we know  $\begin{array}{r}|(Z_{16}\oplus Z_{16}) / \langle (2,2)\rangle | = 32. \end{array}$  Then observing that  $|(1,0) + \langle (2,2)\rangle | = 16$  and  $|(0,1) + \langle (2,2)\rangle | = 16$  we know that the maximum order of any element in the factor group is 16. So, the isomorphism class is  $Z_{16}\oplus$ $Z_{2}$  
31. 3; 6; 12  
33.  $Z_{4}\oplus Z_{4}$  
35. Use Theorems 11.1, 8.1, and 4.3.  
37.  $|\langle a\rangle K| = |a||K| / |\langle a\rangle \cap K| = |a||K| =$ $|\overline{a} ||\overline{K} |p = |\overline{G} |p = |G|$  
39. By the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups, it suffices to show that every group of the form  $Z_{p_1^{n_1}} \oplus Z_{p_2^{n_2}} \oplus \ldots \oplus Z_{p_k^{n_k}}$  is a subgroup of a  $U$ -group. Consider first a group of the form  $Z_{p_1^{n_1}} \oplus Z_{p_2^{n_2}}$  ( $p_1$  and  $p_2$  need not be distinct). By Dirichlet's Theorem, for some  $s$  and  $t$  there are distinct primes  $q$  and  $r$  such that  $q = tp_1^{n_1} + 1$  and  $r = sp_2^{n_2} + 1$ . Then  $U(qr) = U(q) \oplus U(r) \approx Z_{tp_1^{n_1}} \oplus Z_{sp_2^{n_2}}$ , and this latter group contains a subgroup isomorphic to  $Z_{p_1^{n_1}} \oplus Z_{p_2^{n_2}}$ . The general case follows in the same way.  
41. Look at  $D_4$ .  
43. If  $G$  has an element of order greater than 2, then  $\phi (x) = x^{-1}$  is a nontrivial automorphism of  $G$  (see Exercise 12 of Chapter 6).

45. By Theorem 11.1 and Corollary 1 of Theorem 8.2 it suffices to do the case where  $|G| = p^m$  and  $p$  is prime. Then, if  $G$  is not cyclic, it follows from Theorem 11.1 together with Theorem 4.3 that  $x^p = e$  has more than  $p$  solutions.  
47. First observe by direct calculations we have  $|8| = |12| = |18| = |21| = |27| = 4$ .

1. For any  $n > 1$ , the ring  $M_2(Z_n)$  of  $2 \times 2$  matrices with entries from  $Z_n$  is a finite noncommutative ring. The set  $M_2(2Z)$  of  $2 \times 2$  matrices with even integer entries is an infinite noncommutative ring that does not have a unity.  
3. In  $\mathbf{R}$ , consider  $\{n\sqrt{2} \mid n \in Z\}$ .  
5. a, b  
7. In  $Z_{p}$ , nonzero elements have multiplicative inverses. Use them.  
9. If  $a$  and  $b$  belong to the intersection, then they belong to each member of the intersection. Thus,  $a - b$  and  $ab$  belong to each member of the intersection. So,  $a - b$  and  $ab$  belong to the intersection.  
11. Rule 3:  $0 = 0(-b) = (a + (-a))(-b) = a(-b) + (-a)(-b) = -(ab) + (-a)(-b)$ . So,  $ab = (-a)(-b)$ . Rule 4:  $a(b - c) = a(b + (-c)) = ab + a(-c) = ab + (-(ac)) = ab - ac$ . Rule 5: Use rule 2. Rule 6: Use rule 3.  
13. Hint:  $Z$  is a cyclic group under addition, and every subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic.  
15. For positive  $m$  and  $n$ , observe that  $(m \cdot a)(n \cdot b) = (a + a + \dots + a)(b + b + \dots + b) = (ab + ab + \dots + ab)$ , where the last term has  $mn$  summands. Similar arguments apply in the remaining cases.  
17. From Exercise 15, we have  $(n\cdot a)(m\cdot a) = (nm)\cdot a^2 = (mn)\cdot a^2 = (m\cdot a)(n\cdot a)$ .  
19. Let  $a, b$  belong to the center. Then  $(a - b)x = ax - bx = xa - xb = x(a - b)$ . Also,  $(ab)x = a(bx) = a(xb) = (ax)b = (xa)b = x(ab)$ .

21.  $(x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})(a_{1},\ldots ,a_{n}) = (x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n})$  for all  $x_{i}$  in  $R_{i}$  if and only if  $x_{i}a_{i} = x_{i}$  for all  $x_{i}$  in  $R_{i}$  and  $i = 1,\dots ,n$  
23.  $\{1, - 1,i, - i\}$  
25.  $f(x) = 1$  and  $g(x) = -1$  
27. If  $a$  is a unit, then  $b = a(a^{-1}b)$ .  
29. Consider  $a^{-1} - a^{-2}b$  
31.  $0^{1} = 0$  so the set is nonempty. Let  $a^m = 0$  and  $b^n = 0$ . We may assume that  $m \geq n$ . Then in the expansion of  $(a - b)^{2m}$  each term has an expression of the form  $a^{2m - i}b^i$ . So when  $i = 0, 1, \ldots, m$  we have  $a^{2m - i} = 0$  and when  $i = m + 1, m + 2, m + m$  we have  $b^i = 0$ . So, all terms in the expansion are 0. (This argument also works when the exponent of  $(a - b)$  is  $m + n - 1$ .) Finally,  $(ab)^m = a^m b^m = 0$ .  
33. Try the ring  $M_2(Z)$ .  
35. By inspection,  $R$  is closed under addition and multiplication. The elements

$\left[ \begin{array}{ll}0 & 1\\ 0 & 0 \end{array} \right]$  and  $\left[ \begin{array}{ll}0 & 1\\ 0 & 1 \end{array} \right]$  do not commute.

For the general case use  $m \times m$  matrices with the first  $m - 1$  columns all 0 and the last column any elements from  $Z_{n}$ .

37. Observe that  $-x = (-x)^4 = x^4 = x$ .  
39. For  $Z_{6}$  , use  $n = 3$  .For  $Z_{10}$  ,use  $n = 5$  Say  $m = p^2 t$  , where  $p$  is a prime. Then  $(pt)^{n} = 0$  in  $Z_{m}$  , since  $m$  divides  $(pt)^n$  
41. Every subgroup of  $Z_{n}$  is closed under multiplication.  
43.  $ara - asa = a(r - s)a.(ara)(asa) =$ $ara^2 sa = arsa.$ $a1a = a^2 = 1$  , so  $1\in S$  
45. The Subring Test is satisfied.  
47. They satisfy the subring test but the multiplication is trivial. This is, the product of any two elements is zero.  
49. Look at  $(1,0,1)$  and  $(0,1,1)$ .  
51. Observe that  $n\cdot 1 - m\cdot 1 = (n - m)\cdot 1$  Also,  $(n\cdot 1)(m\cdot 1) = (nm)\cdot ((1)(1)) = (nm)\cdot 1.$  
53.  $\{2n / 3^m\mid n\in Z,m$  is a positive integer}. This set is a ring that contains  $2 / 3$  and is contained in every ring that contains  $2 / 3$  
55.  $(a + b)(a - b) = a^2 +ba - ab - b^2 = a^2 -b^2$  if and only if  $ba - ab = 0$  
57.  $Z_{2} \oplus Z_{2}; Z_{2} \oplus Z_{2} \oplus \dots$  (infinitely many copies)  
59. If  $(a,b)$  is a zero-divisor in  $R\oplus S$  then there is a  $(c,d)\neq (0,0)$  such that  $(a,b)(c,d) = (0,0)$ . Thus  $ac = 0$  and

$bd = 0$ . So,  $a$  or  $b$  is a zero-divisor or exactly one of  $a$  or  $b$  is 0. Conversely, if  $a$  is a zero-divisor in  $R$  then there is a  $c \neq 0$  in  $R$  such that  $ac = 0$ . In this case  $(a,b)(c,0) = (0,0)$ . A similar argument applies if  $b$  is a zero-divisor. If  $a = 0$  and  $b \neq 0$  then  $(a,b)(x,0) = (0,0)$  where  $x$  is any nonzero element in  $A$ . A similar argument applies if  $a \neq 0$  and  $b = 0$ .

61. Fix some  $a$  in  $R, a \neq 0$ . Then there is a  $b$  in  $R$  such that  $ab = a$ . Now if  $x$  in  $R$  and  $x \neq 0$  then there is an element  $c$  in  $R$  such that  $ac = x$ . Then  $xb = acb = c(ab) = ca = x$ . Thus  $b$  is the unity. To show that every nonzero element  $r$  of  $R$  has an inverse note that since  $rR = R$  there is an element  $s$  in  $R$  such that  $rs = b$ .  
63. If det  $A = \pm 1$  then by Exercise 9 in Chapter 2  $A^{-1}$  is in  $M_2(Z)$  and by definition  $A$  is a unit. On the other hand, if  $A$  is a unit in  $M_2(Z)$  then  $1 = \operatorname{det}(AA^{-1}) = (\operatorname{det}A)(\operatorname{det}A^{-1})$  where both  $\operatorname{det}A$  and  $\operatorname{det}A^{-1}$  are integers and units in  $Z$ . But the only units in  $Z$  are  $\pm 1$ .  
65. In words,  $S$  is the set of all polynomials in  $\pi$  with the constant term 0. In symbols,  $S = \{c_{n}\pi^{n} + c_{n - 1}\pi^{n - 1} + \dots + c_{1}\pi \mid c_{1}, c_{2}, \ldots, c_{n} \in Z\}$ . To see why  $S$  is the intersection of all subrings of  $\mathbf{R}$  that contain  $\pi$ , let  $T$  be the intersection of all subrings of  $\mathbf{R}$  that contain  $\pi$ . Then  $S$  is one subring in the intersection, so  $T \subseteq S$ , and, by definition,  $S \subseteq T$ .  
67. Experimenting with  $p = 3$  and  $p = 5$  reveals that in both cases  $p + 1$  is the unity. So, we want to show that for all  $x \in R$  we have that  $(p + 1)x = x \mod 2p$ . Observe that because every  $x$  in  $R$  has 2 as a factor,  $(p + 1)x = px + x = x \mod 2p$ .  
69.  $R$  is not closed under multiplication.

# Chapter 13

Mathematics is not a careful march down a well-cleared highway, but a journey into a strange wilderness, where the explorers get lost.

1. The verifications for Example 16 follow from elementary properties of real and complex numbers. For Example 7, note that

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{c c} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{array} \right] \left[ \begin{array}{c c} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c c} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{array} \right].
$$

For Example 8, note that  $(1,0)(0,1) = (0,0)$ .  
3. Let  $ab = 0$  and  $a \neq 0$ . Then  $ab = a \cdot 0$ , so  $b = 0$ .  
5. Let  $k \in Z_n$ . If  $\gcd(k, n) = 1$ , then  $k$  is a unit. If  $\gcd(k, n) = d > 1$ , write  $k = sd$ . Then  $k(n / d) = sd(n / d) = sn = 0$ .  
7. Let  $s \in R, s \neq 0$ . Consider the set  $S = \{ sr \mid r \in R \}$ . If  $S = R$ , then  $sr = 1$  (the unity) for some  $r$ . If  $S \neq R$ , then there are distinct  $r_1$  and  $r_2$  such that  $sr_1 = sr_2$ . In this case,  $s(r_1 - r_2) = 0$ . To see what happens when the "finite" condition is dropped, consider  $Z$ .  
9. Take  $a = (1,1,0),b = (1,0,1)$  , and  $c = (0,1,1)$  
11.  $(a_{1} + b_{1}\sqrt{d}) - (a_{2} + b_{2}\sqrt{d}) = (a_{1} - a_{2}) +$ $(b_{1} - b_{2})\sqrt{d};(a_{1} + b_{1}\sqrt{d})(a_{2} + b_{2}\sqrt{d}) =$ $(a_{1}a_{2} + b_{1}b_{2}d) + (a_{1}b_{2} + a_{2}b_{1})\sqrt{d}$  . Thus, the set is a ring. Since  $Z[\sqrt{d} ]$  is a subring of the ring of complex numbers, it has no zero-divisors.  
13. The even integers.  
15. Suppose that  $a^2 = a$  for some  $a$  in  $Z_{p^n}$ . Then  $a^2 - a = 0$  and therefore,  $p^n$  divides  $a^2 - a = a(a - 1)$ . So, by Euclid's Lemma,  $p$  divides  $a$  or  $p$  divides  $a - 1$ . But  $p$  cannot divide both  $a$  and  $a - 1$ , for otherwise,  $p$  would divide  $a - (a - 1) = 1$ . Thus,  $p^n$  divides  $a$  or  $p^n$  divides  $a - 1$ . This means that  $a = 0$  or  $a - 1 = 0$ .  
17.  $a^2 = a$  implies  $a(a - 1) = 0$ .  
19. If  $a^2 = a$  and  $b^2 = b$ , then  $(ab)^2 = a^2b^2 = ab$ . The other cases are similar.  
21. Let  $f(x) = x$  on  $[-1,0]$ ,  $f(x) = 0$  on  $(0,1]$ ,  $g(x) = 0$  on  $[-1,0]$ , and  $g(x) = x$  on  $(0,1]$ . Then  $f(x)$  and  $g(x)$  are in  $R$  and  $f(x)g(x) = 0$  on  $[-1,1]$ .  
23. Suppose that a is an idempotent and  $a^n = 0$ . By the previous exercise,  $a = 0$ .  
25. The generators are:  $2 + i$ ,  $1 + 2i$ ,  $1 + i$ ,  $2 + 2i$ .  
27.  $a^2 = a$  implies  $a(a - 1) = 0$ . So if  $a$  is a unit,  $a - 1 = 0$  and  $a = 1$ .

29. See Theorems 3.1 and 12.3.  
31. Note that  $ab = 1$  implies  $aba = a$ . Thus  $0 = aba - a = a(ba - 1)$ . So,  $ba - 1 = 0$ .  
33. A subdomain of an integral domain  $D$  is a subset of  $D$  that is an integral domain under the operations of  $D$ . To show that  $P$  is a subdomain, show that it is a subring and contains 1. Every subdomain contains 1 and is closed under addition and subtraction, so every subdomain contains  $P$ .  $|P| = \operatorname{char} D$  when  $\operatorname{char} D$  is prime and  $|P|$  is infinite when  $\operatorname{char} D$  is 0.  
35. Use Theorems 13.3, Lagrange's Theorem, and Theorem 13.4.  
37. By Exercise 36, 1 is the only element of an integral domain that is its own multiplicative inverse if and only if  $1 = -1$ . This is true only for integral domains of characteristic 2.  
39. a. Since  $a^3 = b^3, a^6 = b^6$ . Then  $a = b$  because we can cancel  $a^5$  from both sides (since  $a^5 = b^5$ ).  
b. Use the fact that there exist integers  $s$  and  $t$  such that  $1 = sn + tm$ , but remember that you cannot use negative exponents in a ring.  
41. Observe that  $F^{*}$  (the nonzero elements of  $F$ ) form a group of order 31. So, for any  $a$  in  $F$  other than 0 or 1, we know by Lagrange's Theorem that  $|a| = 31$ .  
43. In  $Z_{p}[k]$  note that

$$
\begin{array}{l} \left(a + b \sqrt {k}\right) ^ {- 1} = \frac {1}{\left(a + b \sqrt {k}\right)} \frac {\left(a - b \sqrt {k}\right)}{\left(a - b \sqrt {k}\right)} = \frac {a - b \sqrt {k}}{a ^ {2} - b ^ {2} k} \\ \text {e x i s t s i f a n d o n l y i f} a ^ {2} - b ^ {2} k \neq 0 \text {w h e r e} \\ a \neq 0 \text {a n d} b \neq 0. \end{array}
$$

45. Let  $S = \{a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\}$  be the nonzero elements of the ring. First show that  $S = \{a_{1}a_{1}, a_{1}a_{2}, \ldots, a_{1}a_{n}\}$ . Thus,  $a_{1} = a_{1}a_{i}$  for some  $i$ . Then  $a_{i}$  is the unity, for if  $a_{k}$  is any element of  $S$ , we have  $a_{1}a_{k} = a_{1}a_{i}a_{k}$ , so that  $a_{1}(a_{k} - a_{i}a_{k}) = 0$ .  
47. Say  $|x| = n$  and  $|y| = m$  with  $n < m$ . Consider  $(nx)y = x(ny)$ .  
49. a. For  $n = 2$  the Binomial Theorem gives us  $(x_{1} + x_{2})^{p} = x_{1}^{p} + px_{1}^{p - 1}x_{2} + \dots + px_{1}x_{2}^{p - 1} + x_{2}^{p}$ , where each coefficient  $p! / k!(p - k)!$  of every term between  $x_{1}^{p}$  and  $x_{2}^{p}$  is divisible by  $p$ . Thus,  $(x_{1} + x_{2})^{p} = x_{1}^{p} + x_{2}^{p}$ . The general case follows by induction on  $n$ .

b. This case follows from Part a and induction on  $m$ .

c. Note  $Z_{4}$  is a ring of characteristic 4 and  $(1 + 1)^{4} = 2^{4} = 0$  , but  $1^{4} + 1^{4} = 1 + 1 = 2.$

51. Use Theorems 13.4.

53.  $n\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  for all members of  $M_2(R)$  if and only if  $na = 0$  for all  $a$  in  $R$ .

55. Use Exercise 54.

57. a. 2 b. 2, 3 c. 2, 3, 6, 11 d. 2, 3, 9, 10

59.2

61. If  $a \in Z_p$  and  $a^2 + 1 = 0$ , then  $a^2 + 1 = (a + i)(a - i) = 0$ .

63. Suppose that  $F$  is a field of order 16 and  $K$  is a subfield of  $F$  of order 8. Then  $K^{*}$  is a subgroup of  $F^{*}$  and  $|K^{*}| = 7$  and  $|F^{*}| = 15$ , which contradicts LaGrange's Theorem.

65. Use Exercise 29 and part a of Exercise 49.

67. char  $R = 0$  . For positive integer  $n$  the subring  $\{0\} \oplus \{0\} \dots \oplus \{0\} \oplus \dots \oplus Z_n\oplus \{0\} \dots$  is subring of characteristic  $n$

69. Observe that because  $u_{S}u_{R} = u_{S} = u_{S}u_{S}$  we have  $u_{S}(u_{R} - u_{S}) = 0$ .

71. Since a field of order 27 has characteristic 3, we have  $3a = 0$  for all  $a$ .

73. Let  $F^{*} = \langle a\rangle$ . Then  $-1 = a^{n}$  for some  $n$ . Thus  $1 = a^{2n}$  and  $|a|$  divides  $2n$ .

75.  $0,1,p - 1,p,p + 1$  .To verify that this list is complete say that  $a\in Z_{2p}$  and  $a^3 = a$  where  $1 <   a <   2p$  . Then we have  $a(a - 1)(a + 1) = 0$  in  $Z_{2p}$  . So,  $p$  divides  $a$  , or  $p$  divides  $a - 1$  , or  $p$  divides  $a + 1$  Thus,  $a = p$  or  $a - 1 = p$  or  $a + 1 = p$

77.  $Z_{2}\oplus Z_{2}\oplus \dots \oplus Z_{2}$

79. Suppose that  $Z_{p}[i]$  is a field and  $p = 1 \mod 4$  and  $a$  and  $b$  are integers such that  $a^2 + b^2 = p$ . Then

$(a + bi)(a - bi) = a^2 + b^2 = p = 0$ . So,  $Z_p[i]$  has a zero-divisor.

Now suppose that  $p = 3$  mod 4. By Theorem 13.2, it suffices to show that  $Z_{p}[i]$  has no zero-divisors. If  $a + bi$  is zero-divisor, then so is  $(a + bi)(a - bi) = a^2 + b^2$  in  $Z_{p}[x]$ . But  $(a^2 + b^2)(x + yi) = 0$  implies that  $a^2 + b^2 = 0$  mod  $p$ . So, there is an integer  $t$  such that  $a^2 + b^2 = pt$  for some integer  $t$ . So, mod 4, we have  $a^2 + b^2 = 3t'$  for some  $t'$  in  $\{0, 1, 2, 3\}$ . Trying all four

cases for  $t^\prime$  gives that mod 4,  $a = b = 0$  or  $a = b = 2$ . So,  $a^2 +b^2$  is 0 or 4. If  $a = b = 0$ , then  $a + bi$  is not a zero-divisor. If  $a = b = 2$ , then  $a^2 +b^2 = 4\bmod p$ , which is not 0 mod  $p$ .  $a^n b = 0$ . This gives us  $a(a^{n - 1}b) = 0$ . But this implies that  $a^{n - 1}$  is a zero-divisor. which is a contradiction.

1. Let  $r_1a$  and  $r_2a$  belong to  $\langle a\rangle$ . Then  $r_1a - r_2a = (r_1 - r_2)a \in \langle a\rangle$ . If  $r \in R$  and  $r_1a \in \langle a\rangle$ , then  $r(r_1a) = (rr_1)a \in \langle a\rangle$ .  
3. Clearly,  $I$  is not empty. Now observe that  $(r_1a_1 + \dots + r_na_n) - (s_1a_1 + \dots + s_na_n) = (r_1 - s_1)a_1 + \dots + (r_n - s_n)a_n \in I$ . Also, if  $r \in R$ , then  $r(r_1a_1 + \dots + r_na_n) = (rr_1)a_1 + \dots + (rr_n)a_n \in I$ . That  $I \subseteq J$  follows from closure under addition and multiplication by elements from  $R$ .  
5. Let  $a + bi, c + di \in S$ . Then  $(a + bi) - (c + di) = a - c + (b - d)i$  and  $b - d$  is even. Also,  $(a + bi)(c + di) = ac - bd + (ad + cb)i$  and  $ad + cb$  is even. Finally,  $(1 + 2i)(1 + i) = -1 + 3i \notin S$ .  
7. Suppose that  $s$  is not prime. Then we can write  $s = pm$  where  $p$  is prime and  $m > 1$ . Then  $\langle s \rangle$  is properly contained in  $\langle p \rangle$  and  $\langle p \rangle$  is properly contained in  $Z_{n}$ . So  $\langle s \rangle$  is not maximal. Now suppose that  $s$  is prime and there is a divisor  $t > 1$  of  $n$  such that  $\langle t \rangle$  properly contains  $\langle s \rangle$  (recall every subgroup of  $Z_{n}$  has the form  $\langle k \rangle$  where  $k$  is a divisor of  $n$ .) Then  $s = rt$  for some  $r$ . So we have  $t = s$ .  
9. If  $aR$  is a non-zero ideal of  $R$  we know that  $aR = R$ . So  $a$  belongs to  $R$ .  
11. Since  $ar_1 - ar_2 = a(r_1 - r_2)$  and  $(ar_1)r = a(r_1r), 4R = \{\dots, -16, -8, 0, 8, 16, \dots\}$ .  
13. If  $n$  is prime, use Euclid's Lemma (Chapter 0). If  $n$  is not prime, say  $n = st$  where  $s < n$  and  $t < n$ ; then  $st$  belongs to  $nZ$  but  $s$  and  $t$  do not.  
15. a.  $a = 1$  b.  $a = 2$  c.  $a = \gcd (m,n)$  
17. a.  $a = 12$

b.  $a = 48$  .To see this, note that every element of  $\langle 6\rangle \langle 8\rangle$  has the form  $6t_18k_1 + 6t_28k_2 + \dots +6t_n8k_n = 48s\in$  48).So,  $\langle 6\rangle \langle 8\rangle \subseteq \langle 48\rangle$  .Also,since  $48\in \langle 6\rangle \langle 8\rangle$  ,we have  $\langle 48\rangle \subseteq \langle 6\rangle \langle 8\rangle$    
c.  $a = mn$

19. Let  $r \in R$ . Then  $r = 1r \in A$ .  
21. Let  $u \in I$  be a unit and let  $r \in R$ . Then  $r = r(u^{-1}u) = (ru^{-1})u \in I$ .  
23. Observe that  $\langle 2\rangle$  and  $\langle 3\rangle$  are the only nontrivial ideals of  $Z_{6}$ , so both are maximal. More generally,  $Z_{pq}$ , where  $p$  and  $q$  are distinct primes, has exactly two maximal ideals.  
25. Clearly, I is closed under subtraction. Also, if  $b_{1}, b_{2}, b_{3}$ , and  $b_{4}$  are even, then every entry of  $\begin{bmatrix} a_{1} & a_{2} \\ a_{3} & a_{4} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} b_{1} & b_{2} \\ b_{3} & b_{4} \end{bmatrix}$  is even.  
27. The proof that  $I$  is an ideal is the same as the case that  $n = 2$  in Exercise 25. The number of elements in  $I$  is  $n^4$ .  
29. That  $I$  satisfies the ideal test follows directly from the definitions of matrix addition and multiplication. To see that  $R / I$  is field first observe that

$$
\begin{array}{l} \left[ \begin{array}{c c} a & b \\ 0 & c \end{array} \right] + I = \\ \left[ \begin{array}{c c} a & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{array} \right] + \left[ \begin{array}{c c} 0 & b \\ 0 & c \end{array} \right] + I = \left[ \begin{array}{c c} a & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{array} \right] + I. \\ \end{array}
$$

Thus we need only show that

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{c c} a & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{array} \right] + I \text {h a s a n i n v e r s e i n} R / I
$$

when  $a \neq 0$ . To this end note that

$$
\begin{array}{l} \Big (\left[ \begin{array}{c c} a & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{array} \right] + I \Big) \Big (\left[ \begin{array}{c c} a ^ {- 1} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{array} \right] + I \Big) = \\ \left[ \begin{array}{c c} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{array} \right] + I = \\ \Big (\left[ \begin{array}{c c} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{array} \right] + I \Big) + \Big (\left[ \begin{array}{c c} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{array} \right] + I \Big) = \\ \left[ \begin{array}{c c} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{array} \right] + I. \\ \Big (\left[ \begin{array}{c c} 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{array} \right] + I \Big) ^ {- 1} = \left[ \begin{array}{c c} 1 / 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{array} \right] + I. \\ \end{array}
$$

31.  $R = \{0 + \langle 2i\rangle ,1 + \langle 2i\rangle ,i + \langle 2i\rangle ,1 + i + \langle 2i\rangle \} .$ $R$  is not an integral domain because  $(1 + i + \langle 2i\rangle)^{2} = (1 + i)^{2} + \langle 2i\rangle =$ $1 + 1 + \langle 2i\rangle = 0 + \langle 2i\rangle$  
33. Let  $I = \langle x^2 - 2x - 3, x \rangle$ . Observe that  $x \in I$  implies that  $x^2$  and  $2x$  belong to  $I$ . Then, so does  $(x^2 - 2x - 3) + (x^2 + 2x) = -3$ . But then  $(-3)(-2) = 1$  belongs to  $I$ . So,  $I = Z_5[x]$ .

35. Use the observation that every member of  $R$  can be written in the form  $\begin{bmatrix} 2q_1 + r_1 & 2q_2 + r_2 \\ 2q_3 + r_3 & 2q_4 + r_4 \end{bmatrix}$ . Then note that  $\begin{bmatrix} 2q_1 + r_1 & 2q_2 + r_2 \\ 2q_3 + r_3 & 2q_4 + r_4 \end{bmatrix} + I = \begin{bmatrix} r_1 & r_2 \\ r_3 & r_4 \end{bmatrix} + I$ .  
37.  $(br_{1} + a_{1}) - (br_{2} + a_{2}) = b(r_{1} - r_{2}) + (a_{1} - a_{2})\in B;r^{\prime}(br + a) = b(r^{\prime}r) + r^{\prime}a\in B$  since  $r^\prime a$  is in  $A$  
39. Use Exercise 21.  
41. Since  $R / I$  has characteristic 2, the additive group of  $R / I$  is isomorphic to  $Z_{2}\oplus Z_{2}\oplus Z_{2}\oplus Z_{2}$  
43. Since every element of  $\langle x\rangle$  has the form  $xg(x)$  , we have  $\langle x\rangle \subseteq I$  . If  $f(x)\in I$  , then  $f(x) = a_{n}x^{n} + \dots +a_{1}x =$ $x(a_{n}x^{n - 1} + \dots +a_{1})\in \langle x\rangle .$  
45. Suppose  $f(x) + I \neq I$ . Then  $f(x) + I = f(0) + I$  and  $f(0) \neq 0$ . Thus,  $(f(x) + I)^{-1} = \frac{1}{f(0)} + I$ . This shows that  $R / I$  is a field. Now use Theorem 14.4.  
47. Since  $(3 + i)(3 - i) = 10, 10 + \langle 3 + i \rangle = 0 + \langle 3 + i \rangle$ . Also,  $i + \langle 3 + i \rangle = -3 + \langle 3 + i \rangle = 7 + \langle 3 + i \rangle$ . So,  $Z[i] / \langle 3 + i \rangle = \{k + \langle 3 + i \rangle | k = 0, 1, \ldots, 9\}$ , since  $1 + \langle 3 + i \rangle$  has additive order that divides 10. If  $2 = |\langle 3 + i \rangle| = 0 + \langle 3 + i \rangle|$ , then 3 is in  $\langle 3 + i \rangle$ . But elements in  $\langle 3 + i \rangle$  have the form  $(3 + i)(a + bi) = 3a - 3b + (a + 3b)i$ , which implies that  $a = 3/2$ . So,  $2 \neq 0$ . A similar argument rules out additive orders 5 and 1.  
49. Use Theorems 14.3 and 14.4.  
51. Since every  $f(x)$  in  $\langle x, 2 \rangle$  has the form  $f(x) = xg(x) + 2h(x)$ , we have  $f(0) = 2h(0)$ , so that  $f(x) \in I$ . If  $f(x) \in I$ , then  $f(x) = a_{n}x^{n} + \dots + a_{1}x + 2k = x(a_{n}x^{n-1} + \dots + a_{1}) + 2k \in \langle x, 2 \rangle$ .  $I$  is prime and maximal.  $Z[x] / I$  has two elements.  
53. One example is  $J = \langle x^2 + 1, 2 \rangle$ . To see that 1 is not in  $J$  note that if there were  $f(x), g(x) \in Z[x]$  such that  $(x^2 + 1)f(x) + 2g(x) = 1$  then evaluating the left side at 1 yields an even integer.  
55.  $3x + 1 + I$  
57. Every ideal is a subgroup. Every subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic.  
59. Let  $I$  be any ideal of  $R\oplus S$  and let  $I_R = \{r\in R\mid (r,s)\in I$  for some  $s\in S\}$

and  $I_S = \{s\in S\mid (r,s)\in I$  for some  $r\in R\}$  . Then  $I_R$  is an ideal of  $R$  and  $I_{S}$  is an ideal of  $S$  . Let  $I_{R} = \langle r\rangle$  and  $I_{S} = \langle s\rangle$  . Since, for any  $(a,b)\in I$  there are elements  $a^\prime \in R$  and  $b^{\prime}\in S$  such that  $(a,b) = (a'r,b's) = (a',b')(r,s)$  , we have that  $I = \langle (r,s)\rangle$

61. Say  $b, c \in \operatorname{Ann}(A)$ . Then

$$
(b - c) a = b a - c a = 0 - 0 = 0. \text {A l s o},
$$

$$
(r b) a = r (b a) = r \cdot 0 = 0.
$$

63. a.  $\langle 3\rangle$  b.  $\langle 3\rangle$  c.  $\langle 3\rangle$

65. Suppose  $(x + N(\langle 0\rangle))^n = 0 + N(\langle 0\rangle)$ . We must show that  $x\in N(\langle 0\rangle)$ . We know that  $x^n +N(\langle 0\rangle) = 0 + N(\langle 0\rangle)$ , so that  $x^{n}\in N(\langle 0\rangle)$ . Then, for some  $m$ ,  $(x^{n})^{m} = 0$ , and therefore  $x\in N(\langle 0\rangle)$ .  
67. The set  $Z_{2}[x] / \langle x^{2} + x + 1\rangle$  has only four elements and each of the nonzero ones has a multiplicative inverse. For example,  $(x + \langle x^2 +x + 1\rangle)(x + 1 + \langle x^2 +x + 1\rangle) = 1 + \langle x^2 +x + 1\rangle$ .  
69.  $x + 2 + \langle x^2 +x + 1\rangle$  is not zero, but its square is.  
71. If  $f$  and  $g \in A$ , then

$$
(f - g) (0) = f (0) - g (0) \text {i s e v e n a n d}
$$

$$
(f \cdot g) (0) = f (0) \cdot g (0) \text {i s e v e n}.
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l} f (x) = \frac {1}{2} \in R \text {a n d} g (x) = 2 \in A, \text {b u t} \\ f (x) g (x) \notin A. \end{array}
$$

73. Hint: Any ideal of  $R / I$  has the form  $A / I$ , where  $A$  is an ideal of  $R$ .

75. In  $\mathrm{Z}$ ,  $\langle 2 \rangle \cap \langle 3 \rangle = \langle 6 \rangle$  is not prime.  
77. According to Theorem 13.3 we need only determine the additive order of  $1 + \langle 2 + i\rangle$ . Since

$$
\begin{array}{l} 5 (1 + \langle 2 + i \rangle) = 5 + \langle 2 + i \rangle = \\ \begin{array}{l} (2 + i) (2 - i) + \langle 2 + i \rangle = 0 + \langle 2 + i \rangle , \text {w e} \\ \text {k n o w t h a t} 1 + \langle 2 + i \rangle \text {h a s o r d e r} 5. \end{array} \\ \end{array}
$$

79. The set  $K$  of all polynomials whose coefficients are even is closed under subtraction and multiplication by elements from  $Z[x]$  and therefore  $K$  is an ideal. By Theorem 14.3 to show that  $K$  is prime it suffices to show that  $Z[x] / K$  has no zero-divisors. Suppose that

$f(x) + K$  and  $g(x) + K$  are nonzero elements of  $Z[x] / K$ . Since  $K$  absorbs all terms that have even coefficients we may assume that  $f(x) = a_{m}x^{m} + \dots +a_{0}$  and  $g(x) = b_{n}x^{n} + \dots +b_{0}$  are in  $Z[x]$  and  $a_{m}$  and  $b_{n}$  are odd integers. Then  $(f(x) + K)(g(x) + K) =$

$a_{m}b_{n}x^{m + n} + \dots +a_{0}b_{0} + K$  and  $a_{m}b_{n}$  is odd. So,  $f(x)g(x) + K$  in nonzero.

81. Use the fact that  $R / I$  is an integral domain to show that  $R / I = \{I, 1 + I\}$ .  
83.  $\langle x\rangle \subset \langle x,2^n\rangle \subset \langle x,2^{n - 1}\rangle \subset \dots \subset \langle x,2\rangle$  But then  $(-3)(-2) = 1$  belongs to  $I$ . So,  $I = Z_{5}[x]$  
85. Suppose that  $J$  is an ideal that properly contains  $I$ . Then  $J / I$  is a subring of  $R / I$  with more than one element and  $|J / I|$  divides  $|R / I|$ . So  $J = R$ .  
87. Look at coset representatives and use the fact that  $(a + bx)^{-1} = \frac{1}{(ax + b)} = \frac{1}{7} ax + b\frac{ax - b}{ax - b} = \frac{ax - b}{-a^2 - b^2}$ . Then check to see if this works.

1. Property 3:  $\phi(A)$  is a subgroup because  $\phi$  is a group homomorphism. Let  $s \in S$  and  $\phi(r) = s$ . Then, for any

$$
\begin{array}{l} \begin{array}{l} a \in A, s \phi (a) = \phi (r) \phi (a) = \phi (r a) \in \phi (A) \\ \text {a n d} \phi (a) s = \phi (a) \phi (r) = \phi (a r) \in \phi (A). \end{array} \\ \begin{array}{l} \text {P r o p e r t y} 4: \text {L e t} a \text {a n d} b \text {b e l o n g t o} \\ \phi^ {- 1} (B) \text {a n d} r \text {b e l o n g t o} R. \text {T h e n} \phi (a) \\ \text {a n d} \phi (b) \text {a r e i n} B. \text {S o}, \end{array} \\ \begin{array}{l} \phi (a) - \phi (b) = \phi (a) + \phi (- b) = \phi (a - b) \in B. \\ \text {T h u s ,} a - b \in \phi^ {- 1} (B). \text {A l s o}, \end{array} \\ \begin{array}{l} \phi (r a) = \phi (r) \phi (a) \in B \text {a n d} \\ \phi (a r) = \phi (a) \phi (r) \in B. \text {S o}, r a \text {a n d} a r \text {a r e} \\ \text {i n} \phi^ {- 1} (B). \end{array} \\ \end{array}
$$

3. We already know the mapping is an isomorphism of groups. Let

$$
\begin{array}{l} \Phi (x + \operatorname {K e r} \phi) = \phi (x). \text {N o t e t h a t} \\ \Phi ((r + \operatorname {K e r} \phi) (s + \operatorname {K e r} \phi)) = \\ \Phi (r s + \operatorname {K e r} \phi) = \phi (r s) = \phi (r) \phi (s) = \\ \Phi (r + \operatorname {K e r} \phi) \Phi (s + \operatorname {K e r} \phi). \\ \end{array}
$$

5.  $\phi (2 + 4) = \phi (1) = 5$  , whereas

$$
\phi (2) + \phi (4) = 0 + 0 = 0.
$$

7. Observe that  $(x + y) / 1 = x / 1 + y / 1$  and  $(xy) / 1 = (x / 1)(y / 1)$ .  
9. The condition that the order of  $k$  divides both  $m$  and  $n$  is necessary and sufficient for the mapping to be group homomorphism is Exercise 5 in Chapter 10.

So, we need to show that  $k$  is an idempotent in  $Z_{n}$  is necessary and

sufficient for  $\phi(ab) = \phi(a)\phi(b)$ . If

$\phi (ab) = \phi (a)\phi (b)$ , then, in

$Z_{n}$ $k = \phi (1) = \phi (1\cdot 1) = \phi (1)\phi (1) = k^{2}.$

On the other hand, if  $k^2 = k$  in  $Z_{n}$ , then  $\phi(ab) = k(ab) = k^2(ab) = (ka)(kb) = \phi(a)\phi(b)$ .

11. For groups,  $\phi (x) = ax$  for  $a = 2,4,6,8$  since each of these has additive order 5. For rings, only  $\phi (x) = 6x$  since 6 is the only non-zero idempotent in  $R$ .

13. If  $a$  and  $b (b \neq 0)$  belong to every member of the collection, then so do  $a - b$  and  $ab^{-1}$ . Thus, by Exercise 29 in Chapter 13, the intersection is a subfield.

15. Apply the definition.

17. Multiplication is not preserved.

19. Yes.

21. The set of all polynomials passing through the point  $(1,0)$ .

23. If  $\phi$  is a ring homomorphism from  $Z_{n}$  to  $Z_{p^2}$ , then  $|\phi (1)|$  is 1 or  $p$ , since it must divide both  $n$  and  $p^2$ . So,  $\phi (1)$  is in  $\langle p\rangle$ . Because the only idempotent in  $\langle p\rangle$  is 0,  $\phi (x) = 0$ .

25. For  $Z_{6}$  to  $Z_{6}$ ,  $1 \to 0$ ,  $1 \to 1$ ,  $1 \to 3$ , and  $1 \to 4$  each define a homomorphism. For  $Z_{20}$  to  $Z_{30}$ ,  $1 \to 0$ ,  $1 \to 6$ ,  $1 \to 15$ , and  $1 \to 21$  each define a homomorphism.

27. The zero map and the identity map.

29. If  $ab = 1$ , then  $\phi(a)\phi(b) = \phi(1)$ , which is a unity in  $S$  (see property 7 of Theorem 15.1). If  $a$  is a zero-divisor in  $R$ , then  $\phi(a)$  is a zero-divisor in  $S$  or is 0.

31. First note that every element of  $R[x] / \langle x^2\rangle$  can be written uniquely in the form  $ax + b + \langle x^2\rangle$ . Then mapping that takes  $ax + b + \langle x^2\rangle$  to  $\left\{\left[ \begin{array}{cc}a & b\\ 0 & a \end{array} \right]\right\}$  is a ring isomorphism.

33. First observe that

$\phi ((0,1)) = \phi ((1,1)) - \phi ((1,0)) =$

$(1,1) - (0,1) = (1,0)$ . Then

$\phi ((a,b)) = a\phi ((1,0)) + b\phi ((0,1)) =$

$a(0,1) + b(1,0) = (b,a).$

35. Observe that an idempotent must map to an idempotent. So, (1, 0) and (0, 1) must map to 0 or 1. It follows that  $(a,b)\to a,(a,b)\to b$  , and  $(a,b)\rightarrow 0$  are the only ring homomorphisms.

37. Say  $m = a_{k}a_{k - 1}\dots a_{1}a_{0}$  and  $n = b_{k}b_{k - 1}\dots b_{1}b_{0}$ . Then

$$
m - n = \left(a _ {k} - b _ {k}\right) 1 0 ^ {k} + \left(a _ {k - 1} - \right.
$$

$b_{k - 1})10^{k - 1} + \dots +(a_1 - b_1)10 + (a_0 - b_0).$

Now use the test for divisibility by 9.

39. Use the appropriate divisibility tests.

41. Mimic Example 8.

43. Observe that the mapping  $\phi$  from  $Z_{n}[x]$  is isomorphic to  $Z_{n}$  given by  $\phi (f(x)) = f(0)$  is a ring-homomorphism onto  $Z_{n}$  with kernel  $\langle x\rangle$  and use Theorem 15.3.

45. The ring homomorphism from  $Z\oplus Z$  to  $Z$  given by  $\phi (a,b) = a$  takes  $(1,0)$  to 1. Or define  $\phi$  from  $Z_{6}$  to  $Z_{6}$  by  $\phi (x) = 3x$  and let  $R = Z_{6}$  and  $S = \phi (Z_6)$ . Then 3 is a zero-divisor in  $R$  and  $\phi (3) = 3$  is the unity of  $S$ .

47. Observe that  $(2 \cdot 10^{75} + 2) \bmod 3 = 1$  and  $(10^{100} + 1) \bmod 3 = 2 = -1 \bmod 3$ .

49. This follows directly from Theorem 13.3 and Theorem 10.1, part 3.

51. No. The kernel must be an ideal.

53. a. Suppose  $ab \in \phi^{-1}(A)$ . Then  $\phi(a)\phi(b) \in A$ , so that  $a \in \phi^{-1}(A)$  or  $b \in \phi^{-1}(A)$ .

b. Consider the natural homomorphism from  $R$  to  $S / A$ . Then use Theorems 15.3 and 14.4.

55. a.

$\phi ((a,b) + (a^{\prime},b^{\prime})) = \phi ((a + a^{\prime},b + b^{\prime})) =$ $a + a^{\prime} = \phi ((a,b)) + \phi ((a^{\prime},b^{\prime}))$  , so  $\phi$  preserves addition. Also,  $\phi ((a,b)(a',b')) = \phi ((aa',bb')) = aa' =$ $\phi ((a,b))\phi ((a',b'))$

b.  $\phi (a) = \phi (b)$  implies that  $(a,0) = (b,0)$ , which implies that  $a = b$ .  $\phi (a + b) = (a + b,0) = (a,0) + (b,0) = \phi (a) + \phi (b)$ . Also,  $\phi (ab) = (ab,0) = (a,0)(b,0) = \phi (a)\phi (b)$ . c. Use  $(r,s)\to (s,r)$ .

57. The mapping  $\phi (x) = (x\bmod m,x,\bmod n)$  from  $Z_{mn}$  to  $Z_{m}\oplus Z_{n}$  is a ring isomorphism.

59. First note that  $\phi (1) = 1$  implies that  $\phi (m) = \phi (m\cdot 1) = m\phi (1) = m.$  Now let  $\phi (\sqrt[3]{2}) = a$  . Then  $2 = \phi (2) = \phi (\sqrt[3]{2}^{3}) = (\phi (\sqrt[3]{2}))^{3}$  and therefore  $\phi (\sqrt[3]{2}) = \sqrt[3]{2}$

61. Use Exercises 52 and 60.

63. If  $a / b = a' / b'$  and  $c / d = c' / d'$ , then  $ab' = ba'$  and  $cd' = dc'$ . So,  $acb'd' = (ab')(cd') = (ba')(dc') = bda'c'$ . Thus,  $ac / bd = a'c' / b'd'$  and therefore  $(a / b)(c / d) = (a' / b')(c' / d')$ .

65. First note that any field containing  $Z$  and  $i$  must contain  $Q[i]$ . Then prove  $(a + bi) / (c + di) \in Q[i]$ .  
67. The subfield of  $E$  is  $\{ab^{-1}|a,b\in D,b\neq 0\}$  
69. Reflexive and symmetric properties follow from the commutativity of  $D$ . For transitivity, assume  $a / b \equiv c / d$  and  $c / d \equiv e / f$ . Then  $adf = (bc)f = b(cf) = bde$ , and cancellation yields  $af = be$ .  
71. Try  $ab^{-1} \to a / b$ .  
73. The mapping  $a + bi \to a \to bi$  is a ring isomorphism of  $\mathbf{C}$ .  
75. Certainly the unity 1 is contained in every subfield. So, if a field has characteristic  $p$ , the subfield  $\{0,1,\dots ,p - 1\}$  is contained in every subfield. If a field has characteristic 0, then  $\{(m\cdot 1)(n\cdot 1)^{-1}|m,n\in Z,n\neq 0\}$  is a subfield contained in every subfield. This subfield is isomorphic to  $Q$  [map  $(m\cdot 1)(n\cdot 1)^{-1}$  to  $m / n$ ].  
77.  $x\to 6x$  is the only possibility.  
79. Say  $\phi$  is a ring homomorphisms from  $2Z$  to  $2Z$  and  $\phi(2) = a$ . Then,  $\phi(4) = \phi(2) + \phi(2) = 2a$  and  $\phi(4) = \phi(2 \cdot 2) = \phi(2)^2 = a^2$ . So,  $2a = a^2$ , which implies that  $a = 0$  or  $a = 2$ . For the general case, let  $\phi(n) = a$ . Then  $\phi(n \cdot n) = n\phi(n) = na$  and  $\phi(n \cdot n) = \phi(n)^2 = a^2$ . So,  $na = a^2$ , which implies that  $a = 0$  or  $n = a$ . In words, the only ring homomorphisms from  $Z_n$  to  $Z_n$  are the identity and the zero map.

SHERLOCK HOMES The Hound of the Baskervilles

1.  $f + g = 3x^4 +2x^3 +2x + 2;f\cdot g =$ $2x^{7} + 3x^{6} + x^{5} + 2x^{4} + 3x^{2} + 2x + 2.$  
3. 1, 2, 4, 5  
5. The only place in the proof of Theorem 16.2 and its corollaries that uses the fact the coefficients were from a field is where we used the multiplicative inverse of lead coefficient  $b_{m}$  of  $g(x)$ .

7. Note the functions defined by  $f(x) = x^{3}, x^{5}, x^{7}, \ldots$ , are the same one defined by  $f(x) = x$  and the ones defined by  $f(x) = x^{4}, x^{6}, x^{8}, \ldots$ , are the same one defined by  $f(x) = x^{2}$ . So all such terms may be replaced by  $x$  and  $x^{2}$ . In the general case note that by Fermat's Little Theorem (Corollary 5 to Theorem 7.1) the function from  $Z_{p}$  to  $Z_{p}$  defined by  $g(x) = x^{p}$  is the same as the function  $f(x) = x$  from  $Z_{p}$  to  $Z_{p}$ . So, every polynomial function with coefficients from  $Z_{p}$  can be written in the form  $a_{p-1}x^{p-1} + \cdots + a_{0}$  where  $a_{p-1}, \ldots, a_{0} \in Z_{p}$ .

9.  $(x - 1)^2 (x - 2)$  
11.  $4x^{2} + 3x + 6$  is the quotient and  $6x + 2$  is the remainder.  
13. Let  $f(x), g(x) \in R[x]$ . By inserting terms with the coefficient 0, we may write  $f(x) = a_{n}x^{n} + \dots + a_{0}$  and  $g(x) = b_{n}x^{n} + \dots + b_{0}$ . Then

$$
\begin{array}{l} \bar {\phi} (f (x) + g (x)) = \phi \left(a _ {n} + b _ {n}\right) x ^ {n} + \dots + \\ \phi \left(a _ {0} + b _ {0}\right) \\ = \left(\phi \left(a _ {n}\right) + \phi \left(b _ {n}\right)\right) x ^ {n} + \\ \dots + \phi (a _ {0}) + \phi (b _ {0}) \\ = (\phi (a _ {n}) x ^ {n} + \dots + \phi (a _ {0})) + \\ \left(\phi \left(b _ {n}\right) x ^ {n} + \dots + \phi \left(b _ {0}\right)\right) \\ = \bar {\phi} (f (x)) + \bar {\phi} (g (x)). \\ \end{array}
$$

Multiplication is done similarly.

15. Note that  $(2x^{n} + 1)^{2} = 1$  and  $(2x^{n})^{2} = 0$  for all  $n$ .  
17. It is its own inverse.  
19. If  $f(x) = a_{n}x^{n} + \dots + a_{0}$  and  $g(x) = b_{m}x^{m} + \dots + b_{0}$ , then  $f(x) \cdot g(x) = a_{n}b_{m}x^{m + n} + \dots + a_{0}b_{0}$ .  
21. Let  $m$  be the multiplicity of  $b$  in  $q(x)$ . Then we may write  $f(x) = (x - a)^n (x - b)^m q'(x)$ , where  $q'(x)$  is in  $F[x]$  and  $q'(b) \neq 0$ . This means that  $b$  is a zero of  $f(x)$  of multiplicity at least  $m$ . If  $b$  is a zero of  $f(x)$  greater than  $m$ , then  $b$  is a zero of  $g(x) = f(x) / (x - b)^m = (x - a)^n q'(x)$ . But then  $0 = g(b) = (b - a)^n q'(b)$ , and therefore  $q'(b) = 0$ .

23. Apply the definitions of function addition and multiplication and ring homomorphism.  
25. Since  $f(2) = 16 - 4 - 2 = 10$ ,  $p = 2$  or 5.  
27. Since  $|U(2) = 1$  and  $|U(3)| = 2$ , those groups are cyclic. For  $p > 3$ , let  $a \in U(p)$  be an element of maximum order; call it  $m$ . If the order of every element of  $U(p)$  divides  $m$ , then every element in  $U(p)$  is a zero of  $x^m = 1$ . But, if  $m < p - 1$ , the equation  $x^m - 1$  has more than  $m$  zeros, which contradicts Theorem 16.3. Now suppose that  $U(p)$  has an element  $b$  whose order does divide  $m$  and let  $q$  be a prime divisor of  $|b|$  that does not divide  $m$ . Then  $\langle b \rangle$  has an element  $b^k$  of order  $q$ . But, it follows from Exercise 23 in Chapter 4 that  $|ab^k| = |a||b^k| = mq > m$ , which contradicts our choice of  $m$ .  
29. In  $Z_{10}$ , let  $f(x) = 5x$ . Then  $0, 2, 4, 6, 8$  are zeros.  
31. If  $(f(x) / g(x))^2 = x$  then  $x^{2}(k(x))^{2} = x(g(x))^{2}$ . But the right side has even degree whereas the left side has odd degree.  
33. Suppose that  $f(x) \in D[x]$  has degree at least 1 and there is a  $g(x) \in D[x]$  such that  $f(x)g(x) = 1$ . Then by Exercise 19 we have  $0 = \deg f(x)g(x) = \deg (f(x) + \deg g(x)) \geq 1$ .  
35. Observe that if  $a^{15} + 1 = 0$  in  $Z_{23}$ , then  $a^{15} = -1$  and, therefore,  $a^{30} = 1$ . So, by Corollary 2 of Theorem 4.1,  $|a|$  divides 30. Moreover, we must also have that  $|a|$  divides  $|U(23)| = 22$ . So,  $|a| = 1$  or  $|a| = 2$ . This gives us that  $a = 1$  or  $a = -1$ . Checking, we see that  $a = -1$  is a zero.  
37. By Theorem 16.5,  $g(x) = (x - 1)(x - 2)$ .  
39. First note that  $-1 = 16$  is zero. Since  $x^{9} + 1 = 0$  implies  $x^{18} = 1$  in the group  $U(17)$ , for any solution  $a$  of  $x^{9} + 1 = 0$  in the group  $U(17)$  we know that  $|a|$  must divide 18 and  $|a|$  must divide  $|U(17)| = 16$ . This gives us  $|a| = 2$  and  $a^{9} + 1 = a + 1$  so that  $a = -1$ . Because  $U(17)$  is cyclic, 16 is the unique element of order 2.  
41. Since  $-1$  is a zero of  $x^{25} + 1$ ,  $x + 1$  is a factor.  
43. Since  $F[x]$  is a PID,  $\langle f(x), g(x) \rangle = \langle a(x) \rangle$  for some  $a(x) \in F[x]$ . Thus  $a(x)$  divides

both  $f(x)$  and  $g(x)$ . This means that  $a(x)$  is a constant. So, by Exercise 17 in Chapter 14,  $\langle f(x), g(x) \rangle = F[x]$ . Thus,  $1 \in \langle f(x), g(x) \rangle$ .  
45. Suppose that  $I = \langle f(x)\rangle$ . Then there is some  $g(x) \in Z[x]$  such that  $2 = f(x)g(x)$ . This implies that  $f(x) = \pm 2$ . But  $x + 2 \in I$  and is not in  $\langle 2\rangle$ .  
47. If  $f(x) \neq g(x)$ , then  $\deg [f(x) - g(x)] < \deg p(x)$ . But the minimum degree of any member of  $\langle p(x) \rangle$  is  $\deg p(x)$ .  
49. For any positive integer  $k$  that are at most  $k$  zeros of  $x^k - 1$ . So, there are at most  $k$  elements in the field that are solutions to  $x^k = 1$ .  
51. "Long divide"  $x - a$  into  $f(x)$  and induct on  $\deg f(x)$ .  
53. By Theorem 16.5,  $I = \langle x - 1\rangle$  
55. For each positive integer  $k$  observe that  $(px^k + 1)(-px^k + 1) = 1$ .  
57. For any  $a$  in  $U(p), a^{p - 1} = 1$ , so every member of  $U(p)$  is a zero of  $x^{p - 1} - 1$ . Now use the Factor Theorem and a degree argument.  
59. Use Exercise 58.  
61. Let  $x^{48} + x^{21} + a$ . Since  $x + 4 = x - 1 \in Z_5[x]$  from the Factor Theorem we need only find an  $a$  in  $Z_5$  such that  $f(1) = 1 + 1 + a = 0$ .  
63.  $\mathbf{C}(x)$  (field of quotients of  $\mathbf{C}[x]$ ).  
65. Take  $R = Z$  and  $I = \langle 2 \rangle$ .  
67. A solution to  $x^{25} - 1 = 0$  in  $Z_{37}$  is a solution to  $x^{25} = 1$  in  $U(37)$ . So, by Corollary 2 of Theorem 4.1,  $|x|$  divides 25. Moreover, we must also have that  $|x|$  divides  $|U(37)| = 36$ . So,  $|x| = 1$  and therefore  $x = 1$ .  
69. Write  $f(x) = (x - a)g(x)$ . Use the product rule to compute  $f'(x)$ .  
71. Say  $\deg g(x) = m$ ,  $\deg h(x) = n$ , and  $g(x)$  has leading coefficient  $a$ . Let  $k(x) = g(x) - ax^{m-n}h(x)$ . Then  $\deg k(x) < \deg g(x)$  and  $h(x)$  divides  $k(x)$  in  $Z[x]$  by induction. So,  $h(x)$  divides  $k(x) + ax^{m-n}h(x) = g(x)$  in  $Z[x]$ .  
73. If  $f(x)$  takes on only finitely many values, then there is at least one  $a$  in  $Z$  with the property that  $f(x) = a$  for infinitely many  $x$  in  $Z$ . But then  $g(x) = f(x) - a$  has infinitely many zeros. This contradicts Corollary 3 of Theorem 16.2.

75. Use Theorem 15.3, Theorem 14.4, and Example 14 in Chapter 14.  
77. Let

$f(x) = a_{n}x^{n} + a_{n - 1}x^{n - 1} + \dots +a_{1}x + a_{0}$  and assume that  $p / q$  is a zero of  $f(x)$  where  $p$  and  $q$  are integers and  $n$  is even. We may assume that  $p$  and  $q$  are relatively prime. Substituting  $p / q$  for  $x$  and clearing fractions, we have  $a_{n}p^{n} + a_{n - 1}p^{n - 1}q + \dots +a_{1}pq^{n - 1} = -a_{0}q^{n}$  . If  $p$  is even, then the left side is even. If  $p$  is odd, then each summand on the left side is odd and since there is an even number of summands, the left side is still even. Because  $a_0$  is odd, we then have that  $q$  is even. It follows that  $a_{n}p^{n} =$ $-(a_{n - 1}p^{n - 1}q + \dots +a_{1}pq^{n - 1} + a_{0}q^{n})$  is even, since the right side is divisible by  $q$  This implies that  $p$  is even. This contradicts the assumption that  $p$  and  $q$  are relatively prime.

79. By the Division Algorithm

(Theorem 16.2) we may write  $x^{43} = (x^2 + x + 1)q(x) + r(x)$  where  $r(x) = 0$  or  $\deg r(x) < 2$ . Thus,  $r(x)$  has the form  $cx + d$ . Then  $x^{43} - cx - d$  is divisible by  $x^2 + x + 1$ . Finally, let  $a = -c$  and  $b = -d$ .

1. Use Theorem 17.1.  
3. If  $f(x)$  is not primitive, then  $f(x) = ag(x)$ , where  $a$  is an integer greater than 1. Then  $a$  is not a unit in  $Z[x]$  and  $f(x)$  is reducible.

7. Suppose that  $r + 1 / r = 2k + 1$  where  $k$  is an integer. Then  $r^2 - 2kr - r + 1 = 0$ . It follows from Exercise 4 of this chapter that  $r$  is an integer. But the mod 2 irreducibility test shows that the polynomial  $x^2 - (2k + 1)x + 1$  is irreducible over  $Q$  and an irreducible quadratic polynomial cannot have a zero in  $Q$ .

17.  $f(x)$  is irreducible over  $Q$ . Nothing.  
19. We first observe that the multiplicative group of the field has order 48. So, the nonzero elements have orders that divide 48. To find  $|x|$  we use the fact that mod  $I$ ,  $x^{2} = -2 = 5 \mod 7$ . Since  $x^{2} = 5$ , we have that  $x^{3} = 5x$  and

$$

23.  $(x + 3)(x + 5)(x + 6)$  
25. By the Mod 2 Irreducibility Test

(Theorem 17.3 with  $p = 2$ ) it is enough to show that  $x^4 + x^3 + 1$  is irreducible over  $Z_2$ . By inspection,  $x^4 + x^3 + 1$  has

no zeros in  $Z_{2}$  and so it has no linear factors over  $Z_{2}$ . The only quadratic irreducible in  $Z_{2}[x]$  is  $x^{2} + x + 1$  and it is ruled out as a factor by long division.

27. a. Consider the number of distinct expressions of the form  $(x - c)(x - d)$ .  
b. Reduce the problem to the case considered in part a.  
29. Use Exercise 28, and imitate Example 10.  
31. Map  $Z_{3}[x]$  onto  $Z_{3}[i]$  by  $f(x) \to f(i)$ . This is a ring homomorphism with kernel  $\langle x^{2} + 1 \rangle$ .  
33.  $x^{2} + 1,x^{2} + x + 2,x^{2} + 2x + 2$  
35. We know that

$$
a _ {n} (r / s) ^ {n} + a _ {n - 1} (r / s) ^ {n - 1} + \dots + a _ {0} = 0.
$$

$$
\mathrm {S o} a _ {n} r ^ {n} + s a _ {n - 1} r ^ {n - 1} + \dots + s ^ {n} a _ {0} = 0.
$$

This shows that  $s \mid a_n r^n$  and  $r \mid s^n a_0$ .

Now use Euclid's Lemma and the fact that  $r$  and  $s$  are relatively prime.

37. Suppose that  $p(x)$  can be written in the form  $g(x)h(x)$  where  $\deg g(x) < \deg p(x)$  and  $\deg h(x) < \deg p(x)$  with

$$
g (x), h (x) \in F [ x ]. \text {B y}
$$

$$
F [ x ] / \langle p (x) \rangle \text {i s a f i e l d w i t h} 0 +
$$

$$
\langle p (x) \rangle = p (x) + \langle p (x) \rangle = g (x) h (x) +
$$

$$
\langle p (x) \rangle = (g (x) + \langle p (x) \rangle (h (x) + \langle p (x) \rangle).
$$

Thus  $g(x) + \langle p(x)\rangle = 0 + \langle p(x)\rangle$  or

$h(x) + \langle p(x)\rangle = 0 + \langle p(x)\rangle$  . This implies that  $g(x)\in \langle p(x)\rangle$  or  $h(x)\in \langle p(x)\rangle$  . In either case we have contradicted Theorem 16.4.

39. Since  $(f + g)(a) = f(a) + g(a)$  and  $(f\cdot g)$

$(a) = f(a)g(a)$ , the mapping is a homomorphism. Clearly,  $p(x)$  belongs to the kernel. By Theorem 17.5,  $\langle p(x) \rangle$  is a maximal ideal, so the kernel is  $\langle p(x) \rangle$ .

41. The mapping  $a\to a + \langle p(x)\rangle$  is an isomorphism.  
43.  $f(x)$  is primitive.  
45. Since  $x^{2} + x + 1$  is the only quadratic irreducible over  $Z_{2}$ , the possibilities are  $x^{2}(x^{2} + x + 1), (x + 1)^{2}(x^{2} + x + 1)$ , and  $x(x + 1)(x^{2} + x + 1)$ .  
47. Let  $f(x) =$

$$
(5 / 7) x ^ {4} + (9 / 2) x ^ {3} + (3 / 4) x ^ {2} + 6 x + 1 / 2.
$$

Then, clearing fractions, we have

$$
2 8 f (x) = 2 0 x ^ {4} + 1 4 \cdot 9 x ^ {3} + 2 1 x ^ {2} + 2 8 \cdot 6 x + 1 4.
$$

This polynomial meets the conditions for Eisenstein's Criterion with the prime 7.

So,  $28f(x)$  is irreducible over  $Q$ . But then by Exercise 5a,  $f(x)$  is also irreducible over  $Q$ .

49. If  $a \in Z_p$  is a zero of  $x^2 + x + 1$ , then  $a^3 = 1$ . So,  $|a| = 3$ , and therefore 3 divides  $|U(p)| = p - 1$ . This gives us that 3 divides both  $p - 1$  and  $p - 2$ . But then 3 must divide  $(p - 1) - (p - 2) = 1$ .  
51. The general result is that  $\langle x, n \rangle$  is prime ideal in  $Z[x]$  if and only if  $n = 0$  or  $|n|$  is a prime.

To see this note that

$I = \langle x,n\rangle = \{f(x)\in Z[x]\mid f(0) = n\} .$  If  $n = ab$  where  $1 <   a <   n$ $g(x) = a$  and  $h(x) = b$  have the property that  $g(x)h(x)$  belongs to  $I$  but  $g(x)$  and  $h(x)$  do not.

1. 1.  $|a^2 - db^2| = 0$  implies  $a^2 = db^2$ . Thus,  $a = 0 = b$ , since otherwise  $d = 1$  or  $d$  is divisible by the square of a prime.  
2.  $N((a + b\sqrt{d})(a' + b'\sqrt{d})) =$

$$
N \left(a a ^ {\prime} + d b b ^ {\prime} + \left(a b ^ {\prime} + a ^ {\prime} b\right) \sqrt {d}\right) = | (a a ^ {\prime} +
$$

$$
\left. d b b ^ {\prime}\right) ^ {2} - d \left(a b ^ {\prime} + a ^ {\prime} b\right) ^ {2} | = \left| a ^ {2} a ^ {\prime 2} + d ^ {2} b ^ {2} b ^ {\prime 2} - \right.
$$

$$
d a ^ {2} b ^ {\prime 2} - d a ^ {\prime 2} b ^ {2} | = \left| a ^ {2} - d b ^ {2} \right| \left| a ^ {\prime 2} - d b ^ {\prime 2} \right| =
$$

$$
N (a + b \sqrt {d}) N \left(a ^ {\prime} + b ^ {\prime} \sqrt {d}\right).
$$

3. If  $xy = 1$ , then

$$
1 = N (1) = N (x y) = N (x) N (y) \text {a n d}
$$

$$
N (x) = 1 = N (y). \text {I f} N (a + b \sqrt {d}) = 1,
$$

$$
\text {t h e n} \pm 1 = a ^ {2} - d b ^ {2} = (a + b \sqrt {d}) (a - b \sqrt {d})
$$

$$
a + b \sqrt {d} \text {i s a u n i t .}
$$

4. This property follows directly from properties 2 and 3.

3. Let  $I = \cup I_{i}$ . Let  $a, b \in I$  and  $r \in R$ . Then  $a \in I_{i}$  for some  $i$  and  $b \in I_{j}$  for some  $j$ .

Thus,  $a,b\in I_k$  , where  $k = \max \{i,j\}$  . So,  $a - b\in I_k\subseteq I$  and  $ra,ar\in I_k\subseteq I$

5. Clearly,  $\langle ab\rangle \subseteq \langle b\rangle$  . If  $\langle ab\rangle = \langle b\rangle$  , then  $b = rab$  , so that  $1 = ra$  and  $a$  is a unit.

If  $a$  is a unit then  $b = a^{-1}(ab) \in \langle ab \rangle$ .

Thus  $\langle b\rangle \subseteq \langle ab\rangle$

7. Say  $x = a + bi$  and  $y = c + di$ . Then

$$
x y = (a c - b d) + (b c + a d) i.
$$

So

$$
\begin{array}{l} d (x y) = (a c - b d) ^ {2} + (b c + a d) ^ {2} = (a c) ^ {2} + \\ (b d) ^ {2} + (b c) ^ {2} + (a d) ^ {2}. \\ \end{array}
$$

On the other hand,

$$
\begin{array}{l} d (x) d (y) = \left(a ^ {2} + b ^ {2}\right) \left(c ^ {2} + d ^ {2}\right) = a ^ {2} c ^ {2} + \\ b ^ {2} d ^ {2} + b ^ {2} c ^ {2} + a ^ {2} d ^ {2}. \\ \end{array}
$$

9. Suppose  $a = bu$ , where  $u$  is a unit. Then  $d(b) \leq d(bu) = d(a)$ . Also,  $d(a) \leq d(au^{-1}) = d(b)$ .

11. Use the fact that  $x$  is a unit if and only if  $N(x) = 1$ .

13.  $3 \cdot 7$  and  $(1 + 2\sqrt{-5})(1 - 2\sqrt{-5})$ . Mimic Example 8 to show that these are irreducible.

15. Observe that  $10 = 2 \cdot 5$  and  $10 = (2 - \sqrt{-6})(2 + \sqrt{-6})$  and mimic Example 8. A PID is a UFD.

17. Suppose  $3 = \alpha \beta$ , where  $\alpha, \beta \in Z[i]$  and neither is a unit. Then  $9 = d(3) = d(\alpha)d(\beta)$ , so that  $d(\alpha) = 3$ . But there are no integers such that  $a^2 + b^2 = 3$ . Observe that  $2 = -i(1 + i)^2$  and  $5 = (1 + 2i)(1 - 2i)$ .

19. Use Exercise 1 with  $d = -1.5$  and  $1 + 2i$ ; 13 and  $3 + 2i$ ; 17 and  $4 + i$ .

21. Mimic Example 1.

23.  $(-1 + \sqrt{5})(1 + \sqrt{5}) = 4 = 2\cdot 2$  . Now use Exercise 22.

25.  $m = 0$  and  $n = -1$  give  $q = -i$ ,  $r = -2 - 2i$ .

27.  $1 = N(ab) = N(a)N(b)$ , so that  $N(a) = 1 = N(b)$ .

29. Suppose that  $bc = pt$  in  $Z_{n}$ . Then there exists an integer  $k$  such that  $bc = pt + kn$ . This implies that  $p$  divides  $bc$  in  $Z$ , and by Euclid's Lemma we know that  $p$  divides  $b$  or  $p$  divides  $c$ .

31. See Example 3.

33.  $p|(a_1a_2\cdots a_{n-1})a_n$  implies that  $p|a_1a_2\cdots a_{n-1}$  or  $p|a_n$ . Thus, by induction,  $p$  divides some  $a_i$ .

35. Use Exercise 10 and Theorem 14.4.

37. Suppose  $R$  satisfies the ascending chain condition and there is an ideal  $I$  of  $R$  that is not finitely generated. Then pick  $a_1 \in I$ . Since  $I$  is not finitely generated,  $\langle a_1 \rangle$  is a proper subset of  $I$ , so we may choose  $a_2 \in I$  but  $a_2 \notin \langle a_1 \rangle$ . As before,  $\langle a_1, a_2 \rangle$  is proper, so we may choose  $a_3 \in I$  but  $a_3 \notin \langle a_1, a_2 \rangle$ . Continuing in this fashion, we obtain a chain of infinite length

$$
\left\langle a _ {1} \right\rangle \subset \left\langle a _ {1}, a _ {2} \right\rangle \subset \left\langle a _ {1}, a _ {2}, a _ {3} \right\rangle \subset \dots .
$$

Now suppose every ideal of  $R$  is finitely generated and there is a chain  $I_{1}\subset I_{2}\subset I_{3}\subset \dots .$  Let  $I = \cup I_{i}$  . Then  $I = \langle a_1,a_2,\ldots ,a_n\rangle$

Since  $I = \cup I_{i}$ , each  $a_{i}$  belongs to some

member of the union, say  $I_{i^{\prime}}$ . Letting  $k = \max \{i^{\prime}|i = 1,\dots ,n\}$ , we see that all  $a_i\in I_k$ . Thus,  $I\subseteq I_{k}$  and the chain has length at most  $k$ .

39. Say  $I = \langle a + bi\rangle$ . Then  
[ a^2 + b^2 + I = (a + bi)(a - bi) + I = I \text{ and } a^2 + b^2 \in I. ] For any  $c, d \in Z$ , let  
[ c = q_1(a^2 + b^2) + r_1 \text{ and } d = q_2(a^2 + b^2) + r_2, \text{ where } 0 \leq r_1, r_2 < a^2 + b^2. ] Then  
[ c + di + I = r_1 + r_2i + I. ]  
41.  $N(6 + 2\sqrt{-7}) = 64 = N(1 + 3\sqrt{-7})$  .For the other part, use Exercise 25.  
43. Theorem 18.1 shows that primes are irreducible. So, assume that  $a$  is an irreducible in a UFD  $R$  and that  $a|bc$  in  $R$ . We must show that  $a|b$  or  $a|c$ . Since  $a|bc$ , there is an element  $d$  in  $R$  such that  $bc = ad$ . Now replace  $b, c$ , and  $d$  by their factorizations as a product of irreducibles and use uniqueness.  
45. See Exercise 23 in Chapter 0.

13.  $x^{7} - x = x(x^{6} - 1) = x(x^{3} + 1)(x^{3} - 1) =$ $x(x - 1)^{3}(x + 1)^{3};x^{10} - x = x(x^{9} - 1) =$ $x(x - 1)^9$  (see Exercise 49 in Chapter 13).  
15. Hint: Use Exercise 49 in Chapter 13.  
17.  $a = 4 / 3, b = 2 / 3, c = 5 / 6$  
19. Use the fact that  $1 + i = -(4 - i) + 5$  and  $4 - i = 5 - (1 + i)$ .  
21. If the zeros of  $f(x)$  are  $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ , then the zeros of  $f(x + a)$  are  $a_1 - a, a_2 - a, \dots, a_n - a$ . Now use Exercise 7.

27. Let  $F = Z_{3}[x] / \langle x^{3} + 2x + 1\rangle$  and denote the cosets  $x + \langle x^3 +2x + 1\rangle$  by  $\beta$  and  $2 + \langle x^3 +2x + 1\rangle$  by 2. Then  $x^{3} + 2x + 1 = (x - \beta)(x - \beta -1)(x + 2\beta +1).$  
29. Suppose that  $\phi: Q(\sqrt{-3}) \to Q(\sqrt{3})$  is an isomorphism. Since  $\phi(1) = 1$ , we have  $\phi(-3) = -3$ . Then  $-3 = \phi(-3) = \phi(\sqrt{-3}\sqrt{-3}) = (\phi(\sqrt{-3})^2)$ . This is impossible, since  $\phi(\sqrt{-3})$  is a real number.  
31. Use long division.  
33. Use Theorem 19.5.  
35. Use Theorem 19.5.  
37. Let  $K$  be the intersection of all subfields of  $E$  that contain  $F$  and the set  $\{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\}$ . It follows from the subfield test given in Exercise 29 Chapter 13 that  $K$  is a subfield of  $E$  and, by the definition, that  $K$  contains  $F$  and the set  $\{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\}$ . Since  $F(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)$  is the smallest such field we have  $F(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n) \subseteq K$ . Moreover, since the field  $F(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)$  is one member of the intersection we have  $K \subseteq F(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)$ . This proves that  $K = F(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)$ .  
39. Since  $|(Z_2[x] / \langle f(x)\rangle)^*| = 31$ , every nonidentity is a generator.  
41. Use the Fundamental Theorem of Field Theory (Theorem 19.1) and the Factor Theorem (Corollary 2 of Theorem 16.2).  
43. Mimic the argument given in Example 11 of this chapter.  
45. Since  $-1 = 1$ ,  $x^n - x$  would have 1 as a multiple zero. But then, by Theorem 19.5,  $x^n - x$  and its derivative, which is  $-1 = 1$ , must have a common factor of positive degree. This is impossible.  
47.  $Q(\sqrt[3]{2})(\omega)$  where  $\omega = -1 / 2 + \sqrt{3} i / 2$ $Q(\sqrt{3} i)(\sqrt[3]{2})$  
49. Observe that the polynomial  $x^{2} - 2x - 1$  is irreducible over  $Z_{5}$ . So Theorems 19.1 and 19.3 shows that such a field exists.  
51. If  $\alpha \in F(\beta)$ , then we have  $\alpha = a\beta + b$  for some  $a, b \in F$ . Squaring both sides, replacing  $\beta^2$  with  $-\beta - 1$ , and solving for  $\beta$ , we find that  $\beta \in F$ . For the second part, if  $\beta \in F(\alpha)$  we have  $\beta = a\alpha + b$  for some  $a, b \in F$ . Solving for  $\alpha$  in terms of  $\beta$  and proceeding as before we get that  $\beta$  is in  $F$ .

53. Because the derivative of  $x^{p^n} - x$  is  $-1$ ,  $x^{p^n} - x$  has no multiple zeroes in any extension of  $Z_p$ .  
55. Let  $f(x) = c_{n}x^{n} + c_{n - 1}x^{n - 1} + \dots +c_{1}x + c_{0}$  Then, using Exercise 49 in Chapter 13 and that the fact that  $0 = 0^{2}$  and  $1 = 1^{2}$  we have  $f(a^{2}) =$ $c_{n}(a^{2})^{n} + c_{n - 1}(a^{2})^{n - 1} + \dots +c_{1}(a^{2}) + c_{0} = (c_{n}a^{n})^{2} + (c_{n - 1}a^{n - 1})^{2} + \dots +(c_{1}a)^{2} + c_{0}^{2} = (c_{n}a^{n} + c_{n - 1}a^{n - 1} + \dots +c_{1}a + c_{0})^{2} =$ $f(a)^2 = 0$  . By repeating the first part of this problem, we know that the five zeros are  $a,a^2,a^4,a^8,a^{16}$  . If any two of these were equal, then we would have  $a^k = 1$  for some positive integer  $k$  less than 31, whereas  $|a| = 31$  because  $\left|(Z_2[x]\langle f(x)\rangle)\right|^* = 31.$

# Chapter 20

A good proof is one which makes us wiser.

YU. MANIN

1. It follows from Theorem 20.1 that if  $p(x)$  and  $q(x)$  are both monic irreducible polynomials in  $F[x]$  with  $p(a) = q(a) = 0$ , then  $\deg p(x) = \deg q(x)$ . If  $p(x) \neq q(x)$ , then  $(p - q)(a) = p(a) - q(a) = 0$  and  $\deg (p(x) - q(x)) < \deg p(x)$ , contradicting Theorem 20.1. To prove Theorem 20.3, use the Division Algorithm for  $F[x]$  (Theorem 16.2).  
3. Note that  $[Q(\sqrt[n]{2}):Q] = n$  and use Theorem 20.5.  
5. Use Exercise 4.  
7. Suppose  $Q(\sqrt{a}) = Q(\sqrt{b})$ . If  $\sqrt{b} \in Q$ , then  $\sqrt{a} \in Q$  and we may take  $c = \sqrt{a} / \sqrt{b}$ . If  $\sqrt{b} \notin Q$ , then  $\sqrt{a} \notin Q$ . Write  $\sqrt{a} = r + s\sqrt{b}$ . It follows that  $r = 0$  and  $a = bs^2$ . The other direction follows from Exercise 7 in Chapter 19.  
9. Since  $[F(a):F] = 5$ ,  $\{1, a, a^2, a^3, a^4\}$  is a basis for  $F(a)$  over  $F$ . Also, from  $5 = [F(a):F] = [F(a):F(a^3)][F(a^3):F]$  we know that  $[F(a^3):F] = 1$  or 5. However,  $[F(a^3):F] = 1$  implies that  $a^3 \in F$  and therefore the elements  $1, a, a^2, a^3, a^4$  are not linearly independent over  $F$ . So,  $[F(a^3):F] = 5$ .  
11. If  $a$  is a zero of  $f(x)$  in  $E$  then  $n = [E:F] = [E:F(a)][F(a):F] = [E:F(a)](\deg f(x))$ .

13.  $g(x) = f(x / b - c / b)$  
15. By the Primitive Element Theorem there is an element  $b$  in  $F(a_{1},a_{2})$  such that  $F(a_{1},a_{2}) = F(b)$ . Then, by induction on  $n$ , there is an element  $c$  in  $F(b,a_{3},\ldots ,a_{n})$  such that  $F(c) = F(b,a_{3},\ldots ,a_{n}) = F(a_{1},a_{2},\ldots ,a_{n})$ .  
17. 6; 3; 2.  
19. They are lattice isomorphic.  
21. Elements of  $Q(\pi)$  have the form  $(a_{m}\pi^{m} + a_{m - 1}\pi^{m - 1} + \dots +a_{0}) / (b_{n}\pi^{n} + b_{n - 1}\phi^{n - 1} + \dots +b_{0})$  , where the a's and  $b$  's are rational numbers. So, if  $\sqrt{2}\in Q(\pi)$  , we have an expression of the form  $2(b_{n}\pi^{n} + b_{n - 1}\phi^{n - 1} + \dots +b_{0})^{2} =$ $(a_m\pi^m +a_{m - 1}\pi^{m - 1} + \dots +a_0)^2$  Equating the lead terms of both sides, we have  $2b_n^2\pi^{2n} = a_m^2\pi^{2m}$  .But then we have  $m = n$  , and  $\sqrt{2}$  is equal to the rational number  $a_{m} / b_{n}$  . This argument works for any real number of the form  $\sqrt[k]{a}$  not in  $Q$  
23. Let  $\{x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n}\}$  be a basis for  $K$  over  $F$ . Then  $K = F(x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n})$  for some  $x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n}$  in  $K$ .  
25. By Theorem 20.5, we have that  $[F_3:F_1] = [F_3:F_2][F_2:F_1]$  and  $[F_4:F_1] = [F_4:F_3][F_3:F_1] = [F_4:F_3][F_3:F_2][F_2:F_1]$ . The general case that  $[F_n:F_1] = [F_n:F_{n - 1}][F_{n - 1}]:$ $F_{n - 2}]\dots [F_2:F_1]$  follows by induction.  
27. Since  $[L:F] = [L:K][K:F]$  we have  $[K:F] = 1$ . It follows that  $F = K$ .  
29. If  $a$  is a zero of  $p(x) \in Q[x]$ , then for  $k \geq 2$ ,  $\sqrt[k]{a}$  is a zero of  $p(x^k) \in Q[x]$ .  
31. Since  $\sqrt{2} = (\sqrt[6]{2})^3$  and  $\sqrt[3]{2} = (\sqrt[6]{2})^2$  we know that  $Q(\sqrt{2},\sqrt[3]{2})\subseteq Q(\sqrt[6]{2})$ . Because  $2^{1 / 6} = 2^{1 / 2}(2^{1 / 3})^{-1}$ , we also have  $Q(\sqrt[6]{2})\subseteq Q(\sqrt{2},\sqrt[3]{2})$ .  
33.9  
35. First observe that  $\sqrt[4]{3}$  is a zero of  $x^{2} - \sqrt{3}$ , which is in  $Q(\sqrt{3})$ . If this polynomial is not a minimal polynomial of  $\sqrt[4]{3}$  over  $Q(\sqrt{3})$ , then  $[Q(\sqrt[4]{3}):Q(\sqrt{3})] = 1$ . But then,  $4 = [Q(\sqrt[4]{3}):Q] = [Q(\sqrt[4]{3}):Q(\sqrt{3})][Q(\sqrt{3}):Q] = 1 \cdot 2$ , which is a contradiction.  
37. If  $ab$  is a zero of  $c_{n}x^{n} + \dots + c_{1}x + c_{0} \in F[x]$ , then  $a$  is a zero of  $c_{n}b^{n}x^{n} + \dots + c_{1}bx + c_{0} \in F(b)[x]$ .  
39. Note that  $x - 3, x^3 - (\pi^3)^2$  and  $x - \pi^3$

are in  $Q(\pi^3)[x]$  and have  $3, \pi^2$ , and  $\pi$  as zeros, respectively. So,  $3, \pi^2$ , and  $\pi$  are algebraic over  $Q(\pi^3)$ . Then, we have by the corollary to Theorem 20.7 that  $3\pi^2 + \pi$  is algebraic over  $Q(\pi^3)$ .  
41. Note that  $[F(a,b):F]$  is divisible by both  $m = [F(a):F]$  and  $n = [F(b):F]$  and  $[F(a,b):F] = [F(a,b):F(b)][F(b):$ $F]\leq [F(a):F][F(b):F]\leq mn.$  So,  $[F(a,b):F] = mn$  
43. Take  $F = Q$ ,  $a = \sqrt[4]{2}$ ,  $b = \sqrt[6]{2}$ . Then  $[F(a, b) : F] = 12$  and  $[F(a) : F][F(b) : F] = 24$ .  
45. Use the quadratic formula and Exercise 7 of Chapter 19.  
47. If  $E$  is a finite extension of  $F$ , pick  $a_1 \in E$  but not in  $F$ . Then  $[E : F] \geq [F(a_1) : F]$ . If  $F(a_1) \neq E$ , pick  $a_2 \in E$  not in  $F(a_1)$ . Then  $[E : F] \geq [F(a_1, a_2) : F]$ . Since  $[E : F]$  is finite, we can continue this process only a finite number of times. The converse follows from Theorem 20.5.  
49. If  $f(a)$  is a zero of  $g(x) \in F[x]$ , then  $a$  is a zero of  $(g \circ f)(x) \in F[x]$ .  
51. Let  $\deg f(x) = m$ ,  $\deg g(x) = n$  and suppose that  $f(x)$  is irreducible over  $F(b)$ . Then  $m = [F(a,b):F(b)]$  and  $[F(a,b):F] = [F(a,b):F(b)][F(b):F] = mn = [F(a,b):F(a)][F(a):F] = [F(a,b):F(a)]m$ . Thus,  $n = \deg g$ .  
53. By the Factor Theorem (Corollary 2 of Theorem 16.2), we have  $f(x) = (x - a)(bx + c)$ , where  $a, b, c \in F(a)$ .  
55. Suppose that there are such rationals. Let  $s = s_1 / s_2$  and  $t = t_1 / t_2$  where  $s_1, s_2, t_1, t_2$  are positive integers. Then  $(r^s)^{s_2t_2} = (\pi^t)^{s_2t_2}$ . But the left side is rational and the right side is not.  
57. A counterexample is  $[Q(4^{1/4}): Q] = 2$ ; another is  $[Q(4^{1/6}: Q] = 3$ .  
59. First note that  $c_{0} \neq 0$ , for otherwise  $c_{d-1}x^{d-1} + c_{d-2}x^{d-2} + \dots + c_{1}x + c_{0}$  has  $x$  as a factor over field  $F$ . So from  $c_{d-1}a^{d-1} + c_{d-2}a^{d-2} + \dots + c_{1}a + c_{0} = 0$  we have  $-c_{0} = a(c_{1} + \dots + c_{d-1}a^{d-2})$ . Multiplying both sides by  $a^{-1}(-c_{0})^{-1}$  we obtain  $a^{-1} = -c_{0}^{-1}c_{d-1}a^{d-2} - c_{0}^{-1}c_{d-2}a^{d-3} - \dots - c_{0}^{-1}c_{1}$ .

1.  $\left[\mathrm{GF}(729):\mathrm{GF}(9)\right] = 3$ ;  $\left[\mathrm{GF}(64):\mathrm{GF}(8)\right] = 2$  
3. The lattice of subfields of  $\mathrm{GF}(64)$  looks like Figure 20.3 with GF(2) at the bottom, GF(64) at the top, and GF(4) and GF(8) on the sides.  
5.  $\mathrm{GF}(2^6)$  
7.  $2a + 1$  
9. Since each binomial coefficient  $\binom{p^i}{j}$  other than  $j = 1$  and  $j = p^i$  is divisible by  $p$  we have  $(a + b)^{p} = a^{p^{i}} + b^{p^{i}}$ . Clearly  $(ab)^{p^i} = a^{p^i}b^{p^i}$ . Since  $\mathrm{GF}(p^{p^i})$  is a field and  $a^{p^i} = 0$  only when  $a = 0$ ,  $\operatorname{Ker} \phi = \{0\}$ .  
11. Observe that  $x^{2} + 1 = (x + 1)^{2}$  
13. The only possibilities for  $f(x)$  are  $x^3 + x + 1$  and  $x^3 + x^2 + 1$ . See Exercise 8 in Chapter 19 for the first case. See Example 2 in this chapter for the second case.  
15. By Theorem 21.4 an element of  $\mathrm{GF}(64)$  has the desired property if and only if it is not in  $\mathrm{GF}(4)$  or  $\mathrm{GF}(8)$ . Since  $\mathrm{GF}(4)$  is not a subgroup of  $\mathrm{GF}(8)$  their intersection is  $\{0,1\}$ . This means there are 54 elements with the property. Given that  $a^7$  in  $\mathrm{GF}(16)$  is a zero of the irreducible polynomial of degree 4 over  $Z_{2}$ , find the other three zeros.  
17. Let  $|F| = p^n$ . Then  $n$  must be divisible by both 4 and 6. So, by Theorem 21.4,  $F$  must also have subfields of order  $p^{12}, p^3, p^2$  and  $p$ .  
19. By observation, the linear factors are  $x$  and  $x - 1$ . Since  $x^8 - x$  has no multiple zeros in  $\mathrm{GF}(8)$ , it has no multiple irreducible factors over  $\mathrm{GF}(2)$ . Because the degrees of the irreducible factors must divide 3 and sum to 8 it follows that the nonlinear irreducible factors must be two cubics. Noting that the only cubic irreducibles over  $Z_2$  are  $x^3 + x + 1$  and  $x^3 + x^2 + 1$ , these are the remaining factors of  $x^8 - x$ .  
21. The statement is trivially true for 0 and 1. Since  $a^{16} = a^4$  implies that  $a^{12} = 1$  we

know that  $|a|$  divides 12. But  $|a|$  also divides  $|\mathrm{GF}(2^n)^*| = 2^n - 1$ , which is odd. So,  $|a| = 3$  and the statement follows.

23. First note that  $x, x - 1$  and  $x - 2$  are factors and that they are the only linear factors. If  $p(x)$  is an irreducible factor of  $x^{27} - x$  then and  $a$  is a zero of an irreducible factor  $x^{27} - x$  of degree  $d$  then  $Z_{3}(a)$  is a subfield of  $\mathrm{GF}(27)$  of order  $3^d$  and by Theorem 21.4 we have that  $d = 1$  or 3. So, the irreducible factorization of  $x^{27} - x$  consists of three linear factors and eight cubic factors.  
25.  $\operatorname {GF}(p^{2n})$  
27. To show that  $F$  is field let  $a, b \in F$ . Then  $a \in F_i$  for some  $i$  and  $b \in F_j$  for some  $j$  and  $a, b \in F_k$  where  $k$  is the maximum of  $i$  and  $j$ . It follows that  $a - b \in F_k$ ,  $ab \in F_k$  and  $a^{-1} \in F_k$  when  $a \neq 0$ .  
29. Since 0, 1, and 2 are zeros we know  $x, x - 1$  and  $x - 2$  are factors and by Theorem 19.8 these each have multiplicity 1. Theorem 21.5 tells us that all other irreducible factors have degree 2 and, since their degrees must sum to six, there are three of them. Finally, from the proof of Theorem 21.1 we know that each of the nine elements of  $\mathrm{GF}(9)$  are zeros of  $x^9 - x$ . So no two quadratic reducibles can be the same. The factorization  $x^9 - x = x(x - 1)(x - 2)(x^2 + 1)(x^2 + x + 2)(x^2 + 2x + 2)$ .  
31. Direct calculations show that given  $x^{3} + 2x + 1 = 0$ , we have  $x^{2} \neq 1$  and  $x^{13} \neq 1$ .  
33. Direct calculations show that  $x^{13} = 1$ , whereas  $(2x)^{2} \neq 1$  and  $(2x)^{13} \neq 1$ . Thus,  $2x$  is a generator.  
35. First observe that for any field  $F$ , the set  $F^{*}$  is a group under multiplication. Now use Theorem 21.2 and Theorem 4.3.  
37. Let  $a, b \in K$ . Then, by Exercise 49b in Chapter 13,  $(a - b)^{p^m} = a^{p^m} - b^{p^m} = a - b$ . Also,  $(ab)^{p^m} = a^{p^m}b^{p^m} = ab$ . So,  $K$  is a subfield.  
39. Consider  $x^{p^n - 1} - 1$  and use Corollary 4 of Lagrange's Theorem (Theorem 7.1).  
41. Structurally identical  
43. Consider  $g(x) = x^{2} - a$ . Note that  $|GF(p)[x] / \langle g(x)\rangle| = p^2$ , so that  $g(x)$  has a zero in  $\mathrm{GF}(p^2)$ . Now use Theorem 21.3.

45.  $F^{*}$ $\mathrm{GF}(2^{5})^{*} = \langle a^{33}\rangle$ $\mathrm{GF}(2^2)^* = \langle a^{341}\rangle$ $\operatorname {GF}(2)^{*} = \langle a^{1023}\rangle = \{1\}$  
47. Since  $F^{*}$  is a cyclic group of order 124, it has a unique element of order 2.  
49. Use Corollary 2 of Theorem 21.2.  
51. Observe that  $p - 1 = -1$  has multiplicative order 2 and  $a^{(p^n - 1)/2}$  is the unique element in  $\langle a \rangle$  of order 2.  
53. Since  $0 = 0^{2}$  it suffices to show that in  $F^{*}$  there are exactly  $(p^n -1) / 2$  elements that can be written as a square of an element of  $F^{*}$ . Observe that the mapping from the cyclic group  $F^{*}$  to itself that takes  $x$  to  $x^{2}$  is a group homomorphism with the kernel  $\{\pm 1\}$ . So, the mapping is 2-1.  
55. Since  $p = 1$  (mod 4) we have  $p^n = 1$  mod 4 and  $\mathrm{GF}(p^n)^*$  is a cyclic of order  $p^n - 1$ . So, by Theorem 4.4 there is exactly two elements of order 4.  
57. First note that is  $a$  not in  $Z_{5}$  for then  $x - a$  would be a factor of the irreducible. Then taking  $b = 0$  and we solve for  $c = (4a + 1)(3a + 2)^{-1}$ .  
59. It is a field of order  $4^5$ .  
61. For the case  $\mathrm{GF}(p^n)$  observe that if  $1 + a + a^2 +a^3 +\dots +a^i = 1 + a + a^2 +a^3 +\dots +a^j$  for some  $i <   j$  then  $0 = a^{i + 1} + \dots +a^{j} = a^{i + 1}(1 + a + a^2 +\dots +a^{j - i - 1})$  and therefore  $a^{i + 1}$  is a zero-divisor.  
63. Let  $F_{1} = \mathrm{GF}(p^{n})$ ,  $F_{2} = \mathrm{GF}(p^{2n})$ ,  $F_{3} = \mathrm{GF}(p^{4n})$ ,  $F_{4} = \mathrm{GF}(p^{8n})$ , ...  
65. The algebraic closure of  $Z_{2}$  
67. By Theorem 21.4, for each prime  $q$  the only proper subfield of  $\mathrm{GF}(p^q)$  is  $\mathrm{GF}(p)$ .  
69. To see that  $\mathrm{GF}(p^{\infty})$  is a field, let  $a$  and  $b$  be elements in  $\mathrm{GF}(p^{\infty})$ . Then  $a$  belongs to  $\mathrm{GF}(p^{m!})$  and  $b$  belongs to  $\mathrm{GF}(p^{n!})$  for some positive integers  $m$  and  $n$ . Thus,  $a$  and  $b$  belong to the larger of these two fields, say  $\mathrm{GF}(p^{m!})$ , which means that  $a - b$  and  $ab^{-1}(b \neq 0)$  also belong to  $\mathrm{GF}(p^{m!})$ , which is a subfield of  $\mathrm{GF}(p^{\infty})$ . Lastly, if  $f(x)$  is any polynomial in  $\mathrm{GF}(p^{\infty})[x]$ , then  $f(x)$  belongs  $\mathrm{GF}(p^{s!}[x]$  for some positive integer  $s$ . Thus, the splitting field of  $f(x)$  over  $\mathrm{GF}(p^{s!})$  is a finite field of characteristic  $p$  and so is contained in  $\mathrm{GF}(p^t)$  for some positive integer  $t$ . This means this splitting field is a subfield of  $\mathrm{GF}(p^{\infty})$ .

71. Since  $x^{16} - x$  has 16 distinct zeros in its splitting field  $E$ , no irreducible factor  $p(x)$  of it can occur in the factorization more than once. Moreover, we know from Theorem 16.5 that the possible degrees of  $p(x)$  are 1, 2, and 4. Because the factorization as irreducibles includes  $x$  and  $x - 1$ , the sum of the degrees of the non-linear factors is 14. Since 14 is not a multiple of 4,  $x^{16} - x$  must have a quadratic factor. Thus it is  $x^2 + x + 1$  because it is the only irreducible quadratic over  $Z_2$ . So, that leaves three irreducible fourth degree factors. Because the sum of the degrees of the irreducible factors is 16.  
73. They are the same.  
75.  $\operatorname {GF}(5^{3k})$  where  $k$  is any positive integer.  
77. By the proof of Theorem 21.1, we have that  $x^n - x = x(x - a)(x - a^2)(x - a^3) \cdots (x - a^{n-1})$ .

# Chapter 22

Only prove to me that it is impossible, and I will set about it this very evening.

Spoken by a member of the audience after De Morgan gave a lecture on the impossibility of squaring the circle.

1. To construct  $a + b$ , first construct  $a$ . Then use a straightedge and compass to extend  $a$  to the right by marking off the length of  $b$ . To construct  $a - b$ , use the compass to mark off a length of  $b$  from the right endpoint of a line of length  $a$ .  
3. Let  $y$  denote the length of the hypotenuse of the right triangle with base 1, and let  $x$  denote the length of the hypotenuse of the right triangle with base  $|c|$ . Then  $y^2 = 1 + d^2$ ,  $y^2 + x^2 = (1 + |c|)^2$ , and  $|c|^2 + d^2 = x^2$ . So,  $1 + 2|c| + |c|^2 = 1 + d^2 + |c|^2 + d^2$ , which simplifies to  $|c| = d^2$ .  
5. Use  $\sin^2\theta +\cos^2\theta = 1$  
7. Use  $\cos 2\theta = 2\cos^2\theta -1$  
9. Use Exercise 6.

11. Solving two linear equations with coefficients from  $F$  involves only the operations of  $F$ .  
13. Use Theorem 17.1 and Theorem 17.3.  
15. If so, then an angle of  $40^{\circ}$  is constructible. Now use Exercise 10.

17. This amounts to showing that  $\sqrt{\pi}$  is not constructible. But if  $\sqrt{\pi}$  is constructible, so is  $\pi$ . However,  $[Q(\pi):Q]$  is infinite.  
19. "Tripling" the cube is equivalent to constructing an edge of length  $\sqrt[3]{3}$ . But  $[Q(\sqrt[3]{3}):Q] = 3$ , so this can't be done. No, for  $4V$  since  $[Q(\sqrt[3]{4}):Q] = 3$ .  
21. Use Exercises 1-4.

1.  $a = eae^{-1};cac^{-1} = b$  implies  $a = c^{-1}bc = c^{-1}b(c^{-1})^{-1};a = xbx^{-1}$  and  $b = ycy^{-1}$  imply  $a = xyz^{-1}x^{-1} = xyc(xy)^{-1}$  
3. Note that  $|a^2| = |a| / 2$  and appeal to Exercise 2.  
5. Observe that  $T(xC(a)) = xax^{-1} = yay^{-1} = T(yC(a))$  if and only if  $y^{-1}xa = ay^{-1}x$ , which is true if and only if  $y^{-1}x \in C(a)$ , which in turn is true if and only if  $yC(a) = xC(a)$ . This proves that  $T$  is well-defined and one-to-one.  $T$  is onto by definition.  
7. Say  $\operatorname{cl}(e)$  and  $\operatorname{cl}(a)$  are the only two conjugacy classes of a group  $G$  of order  $n$ . Then  $\operatorname{cl}(a)$  has  $n - 1$  elements all of the same order, say  $m$ . If  $m = 2$ , then it follows from Exercise 45 in Chapter 2 that  $G$  is Abelian. But then  $\operatorname{cl}(a) = \{a\}$  and so  $n = 2$ . If  $m > 2$ , then  $\operatorname{cl}(a)$  has at most  $n - 2$  elements, since conjugation of  $a$  by  $e, a$ , and  $a^2$  each yields  $a$ .  
9. Consider the correspondence  $\mathrm{T}$  from the left cosets of  $N(H)$  in  $G$  to the conjugates of  $H$  in  $G$  given by  $T(xN(H)) = xHx^{-1}$ .  
11. Say  $\operatorname{cl}(x) = \{x, g_1 x g_1^{-1}, g_2 x g_2^{-1}, \ldots, g_k x g_k^{-1}\}$ . If  $x^{-1} = g_i x g_i^{-1}$ , then for each  $g_j x g_j^{-1}$  in  $\operatorname{cl}(x)$ , we have  $(g_j x g_j^{-1})^{-1} = g_j x^{-1} g_j^{-1} = g_j (g_i x g_i^{-1}) g_j^{-1} \in \operatorname{cl}(x)$ . Because  $|G|$  has odd order,  $g_j x g_j^{-1} \neq (g_j x g_j^{-1})^{-1}$ . It follows that  $|\operatorname{cl}(x)|$  is even. But  $|\operatorname{cl}(x)|$  divides  $|G|$ .  
13. Part a is not possible by the corollary of Theorem 23.2. Part b is not possible because it implies that the center would

have order 2, and 2 does not divide 21. Part c is the class equation for  $D_{5}$ . Part d is not possible because of Corollary 1 of Theorem 23.1.

15. Use Theorem 7.2.  
17. Use Example 5 of Chapter 9 and Theorem 7.2.  
19. Use Theorem 23.5 and its corollary.  
21.  $r$  does not divide  $st$ ;  $s$  does not divide  $rt$ ; and  $t$  does not divide  $rs$ .  
23. 15  
25. Let  $n_p$  denote the number of Sylow  $p$ -subgroups of  $G$ . By Sylow's Third Theorem,  $n_p = 1$ ,  $q$  or  $q^2$ . Clearly,  $p$  does not divide  $q - 1$ , so  $n_p \neq q$ . If  $p$  is a divisor of  $q^2 - 1 = (q - 1)(q + 1)$ , then  $p$  divides  $q - 1$  or  $q + 1$ . But  $p > q$  implies  $p \geq q + 2 > q + 1 > q - 1$ . So,  $n_p \neq q^2$ . Thus,  $n_p = 1$ .  
27. A group of order 100 has 1, 5 or 25 subgroups of order 4; exactly one subgroup of order 25 (which is normal); at least one subgroup of order 5; and at least one subgroup of order 2.  
29. Let  $H, K$ , and  $L$  be Sylow 5-, 7-, and 17-subgroups of  $G$ , respectively. By the Sylow theorems,  $H$  is normal in  $G$  and by Example 5 in Chapter 9 and Theorem 23.6,  $HK$  and  $HL$  are cyclic subgroups of  $G$  of orders of 35 and 85. Thus,  $|C(H)$  is divisible by 5, 7, and 17. So,  $C(H) = G$ . This means that  $H$  is a subgroup of  $Z(G)$ .  
31. By Theorem 23.6  $G / Z(G)$  would be cyclic and therefore by Theorem 9.3  $G$  would be Abelian. But then  $G = Z(G)$ .  
33. By Theorem 23.5,  $n_p$  has the form  $1 + kp$  and divides  $q$ . Thus,  $k = 0$ , and by Corollary 1 of Theorem 23.5, the Sylow  $p$ -subgroup of  $G$  is normal.  
35. Sylow's Third Theorem implies that the Sylow 3- and Sylow 5-subgroups are unique. Pick any  $x$  not in the union of these. Then  $|x| = 15$ .  
37. By Sylow's Third Theorem,  $n_{17} = 1$  or 35.Assume  $n_{17} = 35$  . Then the union of the Sylow 17-subgroups has 561 elements.By Sylow's Third Theorem,  $n_5 = 1$  .Thus, we may form a cyclic subgroup of order 85 (Theorem 23.6). But then there are 64 elements of order 85.This gives too many elements.

39. Use the  $G / Z$  Theorem (Theorem 9.3) and Theorem 23.6.  
41. Let  $H$  be the Sylow 3-subgroup and suppose that the Sylow 5-subgroups are not normal. By Sylow, there must be six Sylow 5-subgroups, call them  $K_{1},\ldots ,K_{6}$ . These subgroups have 24 elements of order 5. Also, each of the cyclic subgroups  $HK_{1},\ldots ,HK_{6}$  has eight generators. Thus, there are 48 elements of order 15, which results in more than 60 elements in the group.  
43. By Theorem 23.2 and Theorem 9.5,  $Z(G)$  has an element  $x$  of order  $p$ . By induction, the group  $G / \langle x \rangle$  has normal subgroups of order  $p^k$  for every  $k$  between 1 and  $n - 1$ , inclusively. Now use Exercise 59 in Chapter 9 and Exercise 59 of Chapter 10.  
45. Pick  $x \in Z(G)$  such that  $|x| = p$ . If  $x \in H$ , by induction,  $N(H / \langle x \rangle) > H / \langle x \rangle$ , say  $y \langle x \rangle \in N(H / \langle x \rangle)$  but not  $H / \langle x \rangle$ . Now show  $y \in N(H)$  but not  $H$ . If  $x \notin H$ , then  $x \in N(H)$ , so that  $N(H) > H$ .  
47. By Sylow's Second Theorem,  $K$  is contained in some Sylow  $p$ -subgroup  $H$ . Then for any  $x$  in  $G$  we have  $K = xKx^{-1} \subset xHx^{-1}$ . By Sylow's Theorem every Sylow  $p$ -subgroup has the form  $xHx^{-1}$ .  
49. Sylow's Third Theorem shows that all the Sylow subgroups are normal. Then Theorem 7.2 and Example 5 of Chapter 9 ensure that  $G$  is the internal direct product of it Sylow subgroups.  $G$  is cyclic because of Theorem 9.6 and Corollary 1 of Theorem 8.2.  $G$  is Abelian because of Theorem 9.6 and Exercise 4 in Chapter 8.  
51. Automorphisms preserve order.  
53. That  $|N(H)| = |N(K)|$  follows directly from the last part of Sylow's Third Theorem and Exercise 9.  
55. Normality of  $H$  implies  $\operatorname{cl}(h) \subseteq H$  for  $h$  in  $H$ . Now observe that  $h \in \operatorname{cl}(h)$ . This is true only when  $H$  is normal.  
57. Suppose that  $G$  is a group of order 12 that has nine elements of order 2. By the Sylow theorems,  $G$  has three Sylow 2-subgroups whose union contains the identity and the nine elements of order 2. If  $H$  and  $K$  are both Sylow 2-subgroups, then by Theorem 7.2,  $|H \cap K| = 2$ . Thus,

the union of the three Sylow 2-subgroups has at most seven elements of order 2, since there are three in  $H$ , two more in  $K$  that are not in  $H$ , and at most two more that are in the third but not in  $H$  or  $K$ .  
59. By Lagrange's Theorem any nontrivial proper subgroup of  $G$  has order  $p$  or  $q$ . It follows from Theorem 23.5 and its corollary that there is exactly one subgroup of order  $q$  which is normal (for otherwise there would be  $(q + 1)(q - 1) = q^2 - 1$  elements of order  $q$ ). On the other hand, there cannot be a normal subgroup of order  $p$  for then  $G$  would be an internal direct product of a cyclic group of order  $q$  and a cyclic group of order  $p$ , which is Abelian. So, by Theorem 23.5 there must be exactly  $q$  subgroups of order  $p$ .  
61. Note that any subgroup of order 4 in a group of order  $4m$  where  $m$  is odd is a Sylow 2-subgroup. By Sylow's Third Theorem, the Sylow 2-subgroups are conjugate and therefore isomorphic.  $S_{4}$  contains both the subgroups  $\langle (1234)\rangle$  and  $\{(1),(12),(34),(12)(34)\}$ .  
63. By Sylow's Third Theorem, the number of Sylow 13-subgroups is equal to 1 mod 13 and divides 55. This means that there is only one Sylow 13-subgroup, so it is normal in  $G$ . Thus  $|N(H) / C(H)| = 715 / |C(H)|$  divides both 55 and 12. This forces  $715 / |C(H)| = 1$  and therefore  $C(H) = G$ . This proves that  $H$  is contained in  $Z(G)$ . Applying the same argument to  $K$ , we get that  $K$  is normal in  $G$  and  $|N(K) / C(K)| = 715 / |C(K)|$  divides both 65 and 10. This forces  $715 / |C(K)| = 1$  or 5. In the latter case,  $K$  is not contained in  $Z(G)$ .  
65. Using Sylow's third theorem and counting the number of elements of orders 2, 3, and 5, we have that the number of Sylow  $p$ -subgroups in each respective cases is 15, 10, and 6.  
67. One of many is (12)(45).

He who learns must suffer.

1. Use the  $2 \cdot$  Odd Test.  
3. Use the Index Theorem.  
5. Suppose  $G$  is a simple group of order 525. Let  $L_{7}$  be a Sylow 7-subgroup of  $G$ . It follows from Sylow's theorems that  $|N(L_7)| = 35$ . Let  $L$  be a subgroup of  $N(L_7)$  of order 5. Since  $N(L_{7})$  is cyclic (Theorem 23.6),  $N(L) \geq N(L_{7})$ , so that 35 divides  $|N(L)|$ . But  $L$  is contained in a Sylow 5-subgroup (Theorem 23.4), which is Abelian (see the corollary to Theorem 23.2). Thus, 25 divides  $|N(L)|$  as well. It follows that 175 divides  $|N(L)|$ . The Index Theorem now yields a contradiction.  
7.  $n_{11} = 12$  . Use the  $N / C$  Theorem (Example 17 in Chapter 10) to show that there is an element of order 22; then use the Embedding Theorem and observe that  $A_{12}$  has no element of order 22.  
9. Suppose that there is a simple group of order 396 and  $L_{11}$  is a Sylow 11-subgroup. Use the  $N / C$  Theorem given in Example 17 of Chapter 10 to show that  $C(L_{11})$  has an element of order 33, whereas  $A_{12}$  does not.  
11. If we can find a pair of distinct Sylow 2-subgroups  $A$  and  $B$  such that  $|A \cap B| = 8$ , then  $N(A \cap B) \geq AB$ , so that  $N(A \cap B) = G$ . Now let  $H$  and  $K$  be any distinct pair of Sylow 2-subgroups. Then  $16 \cdot 16 / |H \cap K| = |HK| \leq 112$  (Theorem 7.2), so that  $|H \cap K|$  is at least 4. If  $|H \cap K| = 8$ , we are done. So, assume  $|H \cap K| = 4$ . Then  $N(H \cap K)$  picks up at least 8 elements from  $H$  and at least 8 from  $K$  (see Exercise 45 in Chapter 23). Thus,  $|N(H \cap K)| \geq 16$  and is divisible by 8. So,  $|N(H \cap K)| = 16, 56$ , or 112. Since the latter two cases yield normal subgroups, we may assume  $|N(H \cap K)| = 16$ . If  $N(H \cap K) = H$ , then  $|H \cap K| = 8$ , since  $N(H \cap K)$  contains at least 8 elements from  $K$ . So, we may assume that  $N(H \cap K) \neq H$ . Then, we may take  $A = N(H \cap K)$  and  $B = H$ .  
13. If  $H$  is a proper subgroup of  $A_{n + 1}$  of order greater than  $n! / 2$ , then  $[A_{n + 1}:H] < [A_{n + 1}:A_n] = n + 1$  and it follows from the Embedding Theorem that  $A_{n + 1}$  is isomorphic to a subgroup of  $A_{n}$ , which is impossible.

15. Use the Index Theorem.  
17. (Gurmeet Singh) By Sylow's third theorem we know that number of Sylow 5-subgroups is 6. This means that 6 is the index of the normalizer of a Sylow 5-subgroup. But then, by embedding theorem,  $G$  is isomorphic to a subgroup of  $A_6$  of order 120. This contradicts Exercise 16.  
19. Let  $\alpha$  be as in the proof of the Generalized Cayley Theorem. Then Ker  $\alpha \leq H$  and  $|G / \mathrm{Ker}\alpha|$  divides  $|G:H|!$ . Now show  $|\mathrm{Ker}\alpha| = |H|$ . A subgroup of index 2 is normal.  
21. If  $H$  is a proper normal subgroup of  $S_{5}$ , then  $H \cap A_{5} = A_{5}$  or  $\{\varepsilon\}$ , since  $A_{5}$  is simple and  $H \cap A_{5}$  is normal. But  $H \cap A_{5} = A_{5}$  implies  $H = A_{5}$ , whereas  $H \cap A_{5} = \{\varepsilon\}$  implies  $H = \{\varepsilon\}$  or  $|H| = 2$ , because in a subgroup of  $S_{n}$  every element is even or half of its elements are even. (See Exercise 27 of Chapter 5.) If  $|H| = 2$ , then it has an element of the form  $(ab)$ . But for any  $c\epsilon \{1,2,\ldots,5\}$  other than  $a$  or  $b$ ,  $(ac)(ab)(ac) \neq (ab)$ . So this case is ruled out.  
23. See Example 9 in Chapter 9.  
25. Mimic Exercise 24.  
27. Suppose there is a simple group of order 60 that is not isomorphic to  $A_{5}$ . The Index Theorem implies  $n_{2} \neq 1$  or 3, and the Embedding Theorem implies  $n_{2} \neq 5$ . Thus,  $n_{2} = 15$ . Counting shows that there must be two Sylow 2-subgroups whose intersection has order 2. Now mimic the argument used in showing that there is no simple group of order 144 to show that the normalizer of this intersection has index 5, 3, or 1, but the Embedding Theorem and the Index Theorem rule these out.  
29. Suppose there is such a simple group  $G$ . Since the number of Sylow  $q$ -subgroups is 1 modulo  $q$  and divides  $p^2$ , it must be  $p^2$ . Thus there are  $p^2 (q - 1)$  elements of order  $q$  in  $G$ . These elements, together with the  $p^2$  elements in one Sylow  $p$ -subgroup, account for all  $p^2 q$  elements in  $G$ . Thus, there cannot be another Sylow  $p$ -subgroup. But then the Sylow  $p$ -subgroup is normal in  $G$ .

31. Consider the right regular representation of  $G$ . Let  $g$  be a generator of the Sylow 2-subgroup and suppose that  $|G| = 2^k n$  where  $n$  is odd. Then every cycle of the permutation  $T_g$  in the right regular representation of  $G$  has length  $2^k$ . This means that there are exactly  $n$  such cycles. Since each cycle is odd and there is an odd number of them,  $T_g$  is odd. This means that the set of even permutations in the regular representations has index 2 and is therefore normal. (See Exercise 27 in Chapter 5 and Exercise 9 in Chapter 9).  
33. If  $\phi$  is such a homomorphism then by Theorem 10.3  $G / \mathrm{Ker}\phi \approx S_n$ . Since  $|G| > n!$  we must have  $|\mathrm{Ker}\phi | > 1$ . So,  $\mathrm{Ker}\phi$  is a proper, non-trivial normal subgroup of  $G$ .

5. Let  $F$  be the free group on

subgroup containing

$\{w_{1},w_{2},\ldots ,w_{t},w_{t + 1},\ldots ,w_{t + k}\}$  . Then  $F / N\approx G$  and  $F / M\approx \overline{G}$  . The homomorphism from  $F / N$  to  $F / M$  given by  $aN\to aM$  induces a homomorphism from  $G$  onto  $\overline{G}$  . To prove the corollary, observe that the theorem shows that  $K$  is a homomorphic image of  $G$  , so  $|K|\leq |G|$

7. Clearly,  $a$  and  $ab$  belong to  $\langle a,b\rangle$ , so  $\langle a,ab\rangle \subseteq \langle a,b\rangle$ . Now show that  $a$  and  $b$  belong to  $\langle a,ab\rangle$ .

19. Use the fact that the mapping from  $G$  onto  $G / N$  given by  $x\to xN$  is a homomorphism.

21. For  $H$  to be a normal subgroup we must have  $yxy^{-1} \in H =$

$$

23. 6; the given relations imply that  $a^2 = e$ .  
 $G$  is isomorphic to  $Z_6$ .

$$

$$
d a = b \Rightarrow b d a = b ^ {2} \Rightarrow e a = b ^ {2} \Rightarrow a = b ^ {2}

$$
a b = c \Rightarrow b ^ {3} = c

7. Both yield paths from  $e$  to  $a^3 b$ .  
11. Say we start at  $x$ . Then we know the vertices  $x, xs_1, xs_1s_2, \ldots, xs_1s_2 \cdots s_{n-1}$  are distinct and  $x = xs_1s_2 \cdots s_n$ . So if we apply the same sequence beginning at  $y$ , then cancellation shows that  $y, ys_1, ys_1s_2, \ldots, ys_1s_2 \cdots s_{n-1}$  are distinct and  $y = ys_1s_2 \cdots s_n$ .  
13. If there were a Hamiltonian path from  $(0,0)$  to  $(2,0)$ , there would be a Hamiltonian circuit in the digraph, since  $(2,0) + (1,0) = (0,0)$ . This contradicts Theorem 28.1.  
15. a. If  $s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_{n-1}$  traces a Hamiltonian path and  $s_i s_{i+1} \cdots s_j = e$ , then the vertex  $s_1 s_2 \cdots s_{i-1}$  appears twice. Conversely, if  $s_i s_{i+1} \cdots s_j \neq e$ , then the sequence  $e, s_1, s_1 s_2, \ldots, s_1 s_2 \cdots s_{n-1}$  yields the  $n$  vertices (otherwise, cancellation gives a contradiction). b. This follows directly from part a.

Now, if we assume only that  $G$  is Hamiltonian, then  $H$  also is Hamiltonian and  $G / H$  exists.

So,  $x + v = u$  and  $x = u - v$ . Now suppose  $u - v$  is a coset leader and  $u$  is decoded as  $y$ . Then  $y$  is at the head of the column containing  $u$ . Since  $v$  is a code word,  $u = u - v + v$  is in the row containing  $u - v$ . Thus,  $u - v + y = u$  and  $y = v$ .

001001 is decoded as 001101 by all four methods.

011000 is decoded as 111000 by all four methods.

000110 is decoded as 100110 by all four methods.

Since there are no code words whose distance from 100001 is 1 and three whose distance is 2, the nearest-neighbor method will not decode or will arbitrarily choose a code word; parity-check matrix decoding does not decode 100001; the standard-array and syndrome methods decode 100001 as 000000, 110101, or 101011, depending on which of 100001, 010100, or 001010 is a coset leader.

19. For any received word  $w$ , there are only eight possibilities for  $wH$ . But each of these eight possibilities satisfies condition 2 or the first portion of condition  $3'$  of the decoding procedure, so decoding assumes that no error was made or one error was made.

1. Note that  $\phi (1) = 1$  . Thus  $\phi (n) = n$  . Also,  $1 = \phi (1) = \phi (nn^{-1}) = \phi (n)\phi (n^{-1}) =$ $n\phi (n^{-1})$  , so that  $1 / n = \phi (1 / n)$  
3. If  $\alpha$  and  $\beta$  are automorphisms of  $E$  fixing  $F$ , so are  $\alpha^{-1}$  and  $\alpha \beta$ .

7. It suffices to show that each member of  $\operatorname{Gal}(K / F)$  defines a permutation on the  $a_i$ 's. Let  $a \in \operatorname{Gal}(K / F)$  and write

$$

Then  $f(x) = \alpha (f(x)) =$ $c_{n}(x - \alpha (a_{1}))(x - \alpha (a_{2}))\cdot \cdot \cdot (x - \alpha (a_{n})).$  Thus,  $f(a_{i}) = 0$  implies  $a_i = \alpha (a_j)$  for some  $j$  , so that  $\alpha$  permutes the  $a_i$  's.

Observe that  $\phi^6 (\omega) = \omega^{729} = \omega$  whereas  $\phi^3 (\omega) = \omega^{27} = \omega^{-1}$  and  $\phi^2 (\omega) = \omega^9 = \omega^2$ $\begin{array}{l}\phi^3 (\omega +\omega^{-1}) = \omega^{27} + \omega^{-27} = \omega^{-1} + \omega ;\\ \phi^2 (\omega^3 +\omega^5 +\omega^6) = \omega^{27} + \omega^{45} + \omega^{54} = \\ \omega^6 +\omega^3 +\omega^5. \end{array}$  
11. a.  $Z_{20}\oplus Z_2$  has three subgroups of order 10. b. 25 does not divide 40, so there are none. c.  $Z_{20}\oplus Z_2$  has one subgroup of order 5.  
13. The splitting field over  $\mathbf{R}$  is  $\mathbf{R}(\sqrt{-3})$ . The Galois group is the identity and the mapping  $a + b\sqrt{-3} \to a - b\sqrt{-3}$ .  
15. Use Theorem 22.3.  
17. Recall that  $A_4$  has no subgroup of order 6. (See Example 5 in Chapter 7.)

19. Use Sylow's First Theorem.  
21. Let  $\omega$  be a primitive cube root of 1. Then  $Q\subset Q(\sqrt[3]{2})\subset Q(\omega ,\sqrt[3]{2}$  and  $Q(\sqrt[3]{2})$  is not the splitting field of a polynomial in  $Q[x]$  
23. Use the lattice of  $Z_{10}$  
25.  $Z_{6}$  (Be sure you know why the group is cyclic.)  
27. See Exercise 21 in Chapter 24.  
29. Use Exercise 43 in Chapter 23.  
31. Use Exercise 50 in Chapter 10.  
33. Since  $K / N \triangleleft G / N$ , for any  $x \in G$  and  $k \in K$ , there is a  $k' \in K$  such that  $k'N = (xN)(kN)(xN)^{-1} = xNxN^{-1}N = xkx^{-1}N$ . So,  $xkx^{-1} = k'n$  for some  $n \in N$ . And since  $N \subseteq K$ , we have  $k'n \in K$ .  
35. Since  $G$  is solvable there is a series  $\{e\} = K_0\subset K_1\subset \dots \subset K_m = G$  such that  $K_{i + 1} / K_{i}$  is Abelian. Now there is a series

$$
\frac {K _ {i}}{K _ {i}} = \frac {L _ {0}}{K _ {i}} \subset \frac {L _ {1}}{K _ {i}} \subset \dots \subset \frac {L _ {t}}{K _ {i}} = \frac {K _ {i + 1}}{K _ {i}},
$$

where  $|(L_{j + 1} / K_i) / (L_j / K_i)|$  is prime. Then

$K_{i} = L_{0}\subset L_{1}\subset L_{2}\subset \dots \subset L_{t} = K_{i + 1}$  and each  $|L_{j + 1} / L_j|$  is prime (see Exercise 42 of Chapter 10). We may repeat this process for each  $i$ .

1.  $x^{2} - x + 1$  
3. Over  $Z, x^8 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)$ $(x^4 + 1)$ . Over  $Z_2$ ,  $x^2 + 1 = (x + 1)^2$  and  $x^4 + 1 = (x + 1)^4$ . So, over  $Z_2$ ,  $x^8 - 1 = (x + 1)^8$ . Over  $Z_3$ ,  $x^2 + 1$  is irreducible, but  $x^4 + 1$  factors into irreducibles as  $(x^2 + x + 2)(x^2 - x - 1)$ . So,  $x^8 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 1)(x^2 + x + 2)(x^2 - x - 1)$ . Over  $Z_5$ ,  $x^2 + 1 = (x - 2)(x + 2)$ ,  $x^4 + 1 = (x^2 + 2)(x^2 - 2)$ , and these last two factors are irreducible. So,  $x^8 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)(x - 2)(x + 2)(x^2 + 2)(x^2 - 2)$ .  
5. Let  $\omega$  be a primitive  $n$ th root of unity. We must prove  $\omega \omega^2 \cdots \omega^n = (-1)^{n+1}$ .

Observe that  $\omega \omega^{2}\dots \omega^{n} = \omega^{n(n + 1) / 2}$ .

When  $n$  is odd,

$\omega^{n(n + 1) / 2} = (\omega^n)^{(n + 1) / 2} = 1^{(n + 1) / 2} = 1.$

When  $n$  is even,

$(\omega^{n / 2})^{n + 1} = (-1)^{n + 1} = -1.$

7. If  $[F:Q] = n$  and  $F$  has infinitely many roots of unity, then there is no finite bound on their multiplicative orders. Let  $\omega$  be a primitive  $m$ th root of unity in  $F$  such that  $\phi(m) > n$ . Then  $[Q(\omega):Q] = \phi(m)$ . But  $F \supseteq Q(\omega) \supseteq Q$  implies  $[Q(\omega):Q] \leq n$ .

9. Let  $2^n + 1 = q$ . Then  $2 \in U(q)$  and  $2^n = q - 1 = -1$  in  $U(q)$  implies that  $|2| = 2n$ . So, by Lagrange's Theorem,  $2n$  divides  $|U(q)| = q - 1 = 2^n$ .

11. Let  $\omega$  be a primitive  $n$ th root of unity.

Then  $2n$ th roots of unity are  $\pm 1, \pm \omega, \ldots, \pm \omega^{n-1}$ . These are distinct, since  $-1 = (-\omega^i)^n$ , whereas  $1 = (\omega^i)^n$ .

13. First observe that  $\deg \Phi_{2n}(x) = \phi (2n) = \phi (n)$  and  $\deg \Phi_n(-x) =$

$\deg \Phi_n(x) = \phi (n)$  . Thus, it suffices to show that every zero of  $\Phi_n(-x)$  is a zero of  $\Phi_{2n}(x)$  .But the fact that  $\omega$  is a zero of  $\Phi_n(-x)$  means that  $|- \omega | = n$  , and because  $n$  is odd, this implies that

$|\omega | = 2n$

15. Let  $G = \operatorname{Gal}(Q(\omega) / Q)$  and  $H_{1}$  be the subgroup of  $G$  of order 2 that fixes  $\cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{n}\right)$ . Then, by induction,  $G / H_{1}$  has a series of subgroups  $H_{1} / H_{1} \subset H_{2} / H_{1} \subset$

$\dots \subset H_t / H_1 = G / H_1$  so that

$\begin{array}{r}|H_{i + 1} / H_1:H_i / H_1| = 2. \end{array}$  Now observe that  $|H_{i + 1} / H_1:H_i / H_1| = |H_{i + 1} / H_i|$

17. Instead, prove that

$\Phi_n(x)\Phi_{pn}(x) = \Phi_n(x^p)$ . Since both sides are monic and have degree  $p\phi (n)$ , it suffices to show that every zero of  $\Phi_n(x)\Phi_{pn}(x)$  is a zero of  $\Phi_n(x^p)$ . If  $\omega$  is a zero of  $\Phi_n(x)$ , then  $|\omega | = n$ . By Theorem 4.2,  $|\omega^{p}| = n$  also. Thus,  $\omega$  is a zero of  $\Phi_n(x^p)$ . If  $\omega$  is a zero of  $\Phi_{pn}(x)$ , then  $|\omega | = pn$  and therefore  $|\omega^{p}| = n$ .

19. Use Theorem 31.4 and Theorem 30.1.

21. Suppose that a prime  $p = 2^m + 1$  and  $m$  is not a power of 2. Then  $m = st$  where  $s$  is an odd integer greater than 1 (the case where  $m = 1$  is trivial). Let  $n = 2^t + 1$ .

Then  $1 < n < p$  and  $2^t \bmod n = -1$ . Now looking at  $p \bmod n$  and replacing  $2^t$  with  $-1$ , we have  $(2^t)^s + 1 = (-1)^s + 1 = 0$ .

This means that  $n$  divides the prime  $p$ , which is a contradiction.
