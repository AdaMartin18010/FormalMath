Thus, I have made examples and exercises the heart of the book. The examples elucidate the definitions, theorems, and proof techniques. The exercises facilitate understanding, provide insight, and develop the ability of the students to do proofs. There is a large number of exercises ranging from straightforward to difficult and enough at each level so that instructors have plenty to choose from that are most appropriate for their students. The exercises often foreshadow definitions, concepts, and theorems to come. Many exercises focus on special cases and ask the reader to generalize. Generalizing is a skill that students should develop but rarely do. Even if an instructor chooses not to spend class time on the applications in the book, I feel that having them there demonstrates to students the utility of the theory."

Modular arithmetic is an abstraction of a method of counting that you often use. For example, if it is now September, what month will it be 25 months from now? Of course, the answer is October, but the interesting fact is that you didn't arrive at the answer by starting with September and counting off 25 months. Instead, without even thinking about it, you simply observed that \\( 25 = 2 \\cdot 12 + 1 \\), and you added 1 month to September. Similarly, if it is now Wednesday, you know that in 23 days it will be Friday. This time, you arrived at your answer by noting that \\( 23 = 7 \\cdot 3 + 2 \\), so you added 2 days to Wednesday instead of counting off 23 days. If your electricity is off for 26 hours, you must advance your clock 2 hours, since \\( 26 = 2 \\cdot 12 + 2 \\). Surprisingly, this simple idea has numerous important applications in mathematics and computer science. You will see a few of them in this section. We shall see many more in later chapters."

The number \\(\\sqrt{-1}\\) is defined to have the property \\(\\sqrt{-1^2} = -1\\). It is customary to use \\(i\\) to denote \\(\\sqrt{-1}\\). Then, \\(i^2 = -1\\). Complex numbers written in the form \\(a + bi\\) are said to be in standard form. In some instances it is convenient to write a complex number \\(a + bi\\) in another form. To do this we represent \\(a + bi\\) as the point \\((a, b)\\) in a plane coordinatized by a horizontal axis called the real axis and a vertical \\(i\\) axis called the imaginary axis. The distance from the point \\(a + bi\\) to the origin is \\(r = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\\) and is often denoted by \\(|a + bi|\\) and called the norm of \\(a + bi\\). If we draw the line segment from the origin to \\(a + bi\\) and denote the angle formed by the line segment and the positive real axis by \\(\\theta\\), we can write \\(a + bi\\) as \\(r(\\cos \\theta + i\\sin \\theta)\\)."

Congruent triangles that are situated differently in the plane are not the same, but they are often considered to be the same in plane geometry. In physics, vectors of the same magnitude and direction can produce different effects—a 10-pound weight placed 2 feet from a fulcrum produces a different effect than a 10-pound weight placed 1 foot from a fulcrum. But in linear algebra, vectors of the same magnitude and direction are considered to be the same.

Our goal in this chapter is to describe all possible ways in which this can be done. More specifically, we want to describe the possible relationships between the starting position of the square and its final position in terms of motions. However, we are interested in the net effect of a motion, rather than in the motion itself. Thus, for example, we consider a \\(90^{\\circ}\\) rotation and a \\(450^{\\circ}\\) rotation as equal, since they have the same net effect on every point. With this simplifying convention, it is an easy matter to achieve our goal."

With this marking scheme, we are now in a position to describe, in simple fashion, all possible ways in which a square object can be repositioned. See Figure 1.1. We now claim that any motion—no matter how complicated—is equivalent to one of these eight. To verify this claim, observe that the final position of the square is completely determined by the location and orientation (i.e., face up or face down) of any particular corner. But, clearly, there are only four locations and two orientations for a given corner, so there are exactly eight distinct final positions for the corner."

Perhaps the most important feature of this table is that it has been completely filled in without introducing any new motions. Of course, this is because, as we have already pointed out, any sequence of motions turns out to be the same as one of these eight. Algebraically, this says that if \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are in \\( D_4 \\), then so is \\( AB \\). This property is called closure, and it is one of the requirements for a mathematical system to be a group. Next, notice that if \\( A \\) is any element of \\( D_4 \\), then \\( AR_0 = R_0A = A \\). Thus, combining any element \\( A \\) on either side with \\( R_0 \\) yields \\( A \\) back again. An element \\( R_0 \\) with this property is called an identity, and every group must have one. Moreover, we see that for each element \\( A \\) in \\( D_4 \\), there is exactly one element \\( B \\) in \\( D_4 \\) such that \\( AB = BA = R_0 \\). In this case, \\( B \\) is said to be the inverse of \\( A \\) and vice versa. For example, \\( R_{90} \\) and \\( R_{270} \\) are inverses of each other, and \\( H \\) is its own inverse. The term inverse is a descriptive one, for if \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are inverses of each other, then \\( B \\) \"undoes\" whatever \\( A \\) \"does,\" in the sense that \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) taken together in either order produce \\( R_0 \\), representing no change. Another striking feature of the table is that every element of \\( D_4 \\) appears exactly once in each row and column. This feature is something that all groups must have, and, indeed, it is quite useful to keep this fact in mind when constructing the table in the first place."

Obviously, a rotation of a plane about a point in the plane is a symmetry of the plane, and a rotation about a line in three dimensions is a symmetry in three-dimensional space. Similarly, any translation of a plane or of three-dimensional space is a symmetry. A reflection across a line \\( L \\) is that function which leaves every point of \\( L \\) fixed and takes any point \\( Q \\), not on \\( L \\), to the point \\( Q' \\) so that \\( L \\) is the perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining \\( Q \\) and \\( Q' \\) (see Figure 1.4). Figure 1.4 illustrates the characteristic that distinguishes a reflection from a rotation. The reflected image of a clockwise spiral is a counterclockwise spiral and vice versa. In particular, rotations preserve orientation and reflections reverse orientation. We will use this fact often. Also note that reflections reverse handedness, which is an important fact in chemistry."

Notice that the restriction of a \\(180^{\\circ}\\) rotation about a line \\(L\\) in three dimensions to a plane containing \\(L\\) is a reflection across \\(L\\) in the plane. Thus, in the dihedral groups, the motions that we described as flips about axes of symmetry in three dimensions (e.g., \\(H\\), \\(V\\), \\(D\\), \\(D'\\)) are reflections across lines in two dimensions. Just as a reflection across a line is a plane symmetry that cannot be achieved by a physical motion of the plane in two dimensions, a reflection across a plane is a three-dimensional symmetry that cannot be achieved by a physical motion of three-dimensional space. A cup, for instance, has reflective symmetry across the plane bisecting the cup, but this symmetry cannot be duplicated with a physical motion in three dimensions."

For example, consider the subgroup of all rotations in \\( D_6 \\). Clearly, one generator is \\( R_{60} \\). And, since \\( |R_{60}| = 6 \\), we see by Corollary 3 that the only other generator is \\( (R_{60})^5 = R_{300} \\). Of course, we could have readily deduced this information without the aid of Corollary 3 by direct calculations. So, to illustrate the real power of Corollary 3, let us use it to find all generators of the cyclic group \\( U(50) \\). First, note that direct computations show that \\( |U(50)| = 20 \\) and that 3 is one of its generators. Thus, in view of Corollary 3, the complete list of generators for \\( U(50) \\) is"

In this chapter we introduce a family of non-Abelian groups of certain functions called permutation groups from a set \\( A \\) to itself. In the early and mid-19th century, groups of permutations were the only groups investigated by mathematicians. It was not until around 1850 that the notion of an abstract group was introduced by Cayley, and it took another quarter century before the idea firmly took hold. Permutation groups are important in the theory of groups and in computer science, physics, and chemistry."

What is the cycle form of \\( \\alpha \\beta \\)? Of course, one could say that \\( \\alpha \\beta = (13)(27)(456)(8)(1237)(648)(5) \\), but it is usually more desirable to express a permutation in a disjoint cycle form (i.e., the various cycles have no number in common). We proceed by treating each of the seven cycles of \\( \\alpha \\beta \\) as a function from the set \\( \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 8\\} \\) to itself and use function composition, keeping in mind that function composition is done from right to left and that each cycle that does not contain a symbol fixes that symbol. So let's see what we get for \\( (\\alpha \\beta)(1) \\). We observe that (5) fixes 1, then (648) fixes 1, then (1237) sends 1 to 2, then (8) fixes 2, then (456) fixes 2, then (27) sends 2 to 7, and, lastly, (13) fixes 7.

Next, suppose that \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\beta \\) are disjoint cycles of lengths \\( m \\) and \\( n \\), and let \\( k \\) be the least common multiple of \\( m \\) and \\( n \\). It follows from Theorem 4.1 that both \\( \\alpha^k \\) and \\( \\beta^k \\) are the identity permutation \\( \\varepsilon \\) and, since \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\beta \\) commute, \\( (\\alpha \\beta)^k = \\alpha^k\\beta^k \\) is also the identity. Thus, we know by Corollary 2 to Theorem 4.1 \\( (a^{k} = e \\) implies that \\( |a| \\) divides \\( k \\)) that the order of \\( \\alpha \\beta \\)—let us call it \\( t \\)—must divide \\( k \\). But then \\( (\\alpha \\beta)^{t} = \\alpha^{t}\\beta^{t} = \\varepsilon \\). Since \\( \\alpha \\) and \\( \\beta \\) are disjoint we know that \\( \\alpha^t \\) fixes the elements of \\( \\beta \\) and \\( \\beta^t \\) fixes the elements of \\( \\alpha \\) and it follows that \\( \\alpha^t\\beta^t \\) fixes 1 through \\( n \\) only when both \\( \\alpha^t = \\varepsilon \\) and \\( \\beta^t = \\varepsilon \\). But then \\( t \\) is a common multiple of \\( m \\) and \\( n \\). Because \\( k \\) is the least common multiple of \\( m \\) and \\( n \\), we then have \\( k\\leq t \\), which gives us that \\( k = t \\)."

Although the number of ways to fill these slots is \\( 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\), this product counts the cycle \\( (a_1a_2a_3a_4) \\) four times. For example, the 4-cycle (2741) can also be written as (7412), (4127), (1274) whereas the product \\( 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\) counts them as distinct. Likewise, the \\( 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1 \\) expressions for \\( (a_5a_6a_7) \\) counts the cycles \\( (a_5a_6a_7), (a_6a_7a_5) \\) and \\( (a_7a_5a_6) \\) as distinct even though they are equal in \\( S_7 \\).

Clearly, \\(r\\neq 1\\) since a 2-cycle is not the identity. Say \\(\\beta_{1} = (ab)\\). Now observe that there must a 2-cycle \\(\\beta_{i}\\) with \\(i > 1\\) that contains \\(a\\), for otherwise our product would take \\(a\\) to \\(b\\). We may assume that our product \\(\\beta_{1}\\beta_{2}\\dots \\beta_{r}\\) is one for which such an \\(i\\) is minimum. We may further assume that among all such products our is one with the fewest number of \\(a\\)'s as an entry in any cycle. If \\(i = 2\\), then \\(\\beta_{1}\\beta_{2}\\) has the form \\((ab)(ab)\\) or \\((ab)(ac)\\) where \\(c\\neq b\\) (we can lead with \\(a\\) in the second cycle because \\((ca) = (ac)\\)). If \\(\\beta_{1}\\beta_{2} = (ab)(ab) = \\varepsilon\\) then by deleting it we are left with a product with an odd number of 2-cycles that has fewer appearances of \\(a\\)'s, which contradicts our choice of the product. If \\(\\beta_{1}\\beta_{2} = (ab)(ac)\\) where \\(c\\neq b\\) we observe that because \\((ab)(ac) = (ac)(bc)\\) we can replace \\(\\beta_{1}\\beta_{2} = (ab)(ac)\\) with \\(\\beta_1^\\prime \\beta_2^\\prime = (ac)(bc)\\) to obtain a product of \\(r\\) 2-cycles equal to the identity with an \\(a\\) in the first cycle and one fewer \\(a\\) entry in the product \\(\\beta_1^\\prime \\beta_2^\\prime \\dots \\beta_r\\) than is in \\(\\beta_{1}\\beta_{2}\\dots \\beta_{r}\\). Since this gives us a contradiction, we may assume that \\(i > 2\\). Next note that \\(\\beta_{i - 1}\\) does not contain \\(a\\) but does contain \\(c\\) for otherwise \\(\\beta_{i - 1}\\) and \\(\\beta_{i}\\) are disjoint and therefore \\(\\beta_1^\\prime \\beta_2^\\prime \\dots \\beta_{i - 2}\\beta_{i - 2}\\beta_{i + 1}\\dots \\beta_r\\) is a product of \\(r\\) 2-cycles that is the identity, has an \\(a\\) in the first cycle, and the second appearance of an \\(a\\) entry occurs before the \\(i\\)th cycle in the product. This contradicts our choice of \\(i\\). So, we know that \\(\\beta_{i - 1}\\beta_{i}\\) has the form \\((dc)(ac)\\) where \\(d\\neq a\\). Then, because \\((dc)(ac) = (ad)(dc)\\), we can replace \\(\\beta_{i - 1}\\beta_i = (dc)(ac)\\) in the product \\(\\beta_1'\\beta_2'\\dots \\beta_r\\) with \\(\\beta_{i - 1}'\\beta_i' = (ad)(dc)\\) to obtain \\(\\beta_1'\\beta_2'\\dots \\beta_{i - 1}'\\beta_i'\\dots \\beta_r\\), which as before, is a product of \\(r\\) 2-cycles that is the identity and has an \\(a\\) in the first cycle and the second appearance of an \\(a\\) entry occurs before that \\(i\\)th cycle in the product. This contradiction finishes the proof."

Moreover, the banknote scheme does not detect all transpositions of adjacent characters involving the check digit itself. For example, the transposition of D and 8 in positions 10 and 11 is not detected. Both of these defects can be avoided by using the Verhoeff method with \\(D_{18}\\), the dihedral group of order 36, to assign every letter and digit a distinct value together with an appropriate function \\(\\sigma\\). Using this method to append a check character, all single position errors and all transposition errors involving adjacent digits will be detected."

No. They are both counting the objects, but they are using different terminology to do so. Similarly, when one person says, \"Two plus three is five\" and another says, \"Zwei und drei ist fünf,\" the two are in agreement on the concept they are describing, but they are using different terminology to describe the concept. An analogous situation often occurs with groups; the same group is described with different terminology. We have seen two examples of this so far. In Chapter 1, we described the symmetries of a square in geometric terms (e.g., \\( R_{90} \\)), whereas in Chapter 5 we described the same group by way of permutations of the corners. In both cases, the underlying group was the symmetries of a square. In Chapter 4, we observed that when we have a cyclic group of order \\( n \\) generated by \\( a \\), the operation turns out to be essentially that of addition modulo \\( n \\), since \\( a^r a^s = a^k \\), where \\( k = (r + s) \\mod n \\). For example, each of \\( U(43) \\) and \\( U(49) \\) is cyclic of order 42. So, each has the form \\( \\langle a \\rangle \\), where \\( a^r a^s = a^{(r + s)^{\\mathrm{mod} 42}} \\)."

So the only possibilities for \\(\\operatorname{Aut}(Z_{10})\\) are \\(\\alpha_{1}\\), \\(\\alpha_{3}\\), \\(\\alpha_{7}\\), and \\(\\alpha_{9}\\). But are all these automorphisms? Clearly, \\(\\alpha_{1}\\) is the identity. Let us check \\(\\alpha_{3}\\). Since \\(x \\bmod 10 = y \\bmod 10\\) implies \\(3x \\bmod 10 = 3y \\bmod 10\\), \\(\\alpha_{3}\\) is well defined. Moreover, because \\(a_{3}(1) = 3\\) is a generator of \\(Z_{10}\\), it follows that \\(\\alpha_{3}\\) is onto (and, by Exercise 13 in Chapter 5, it is also one-to-one). Finally, since \\(\\alpha_{3}(a + b) = 3(a + b) = 3a + 3b = \\alpha_{3}(a) + \\alpha_{3}(b)\\), we see that \\(\\alpha_{3}\\) is operation-preserving as well.

Indeed, Cayley's Theorem tells us that abstract groups are not different from permutation groups. Rather, it is the viewpoint that is different. It is this difference of viewpoint that has stimulated the tremendous progress in group theory and many other branches of mathematics in the past 100 years."

Property 5 says—and this is very important—that two left cosets of \\( H \\) are either identical or disjoint. Thus, a left coset of \\( H \\) is uniquely determined by any one of its elements. In particular, any element of a left coset can be used to represent the coset.

We find our next coset by choosing a representative not already appearing in the two previously chosen cosets, say 5. This gives us the coset \\( 5H = \\{5, 11\\} \\). We continue to form cosets by picking elements from \\( U(32) \\) that have not yet appeared in the previous cosets as representatives of the cosets until we have accounted for every element of \\( U(32) \\).

To this end, observe that a cube has four diagonals and that the rotation group induces a group of permutations on the four diagonals. But we must be careful not to assume that different rotations correspond to different permutations. To see that this is so, all we need do is show that all 24 permutations of the diagonals arise from rotations. Labeling the consecutive diagonals 1, 2, 3, and 4, it is obvious that there is a \\( 90^\\circ \\) rotation that yields the permutation \\( \\alpha = (1234) \\); another \\( 90^\\circ \\) rotation about an axis perpendicular to our first axis yields the permutation \\( \\beta = (1423) \\). See Figure 7.3. So, the group of permutations induced by the rotations contains the eight-element subgroup \\( \\{\\varepsilon, \\alpha, \\alpha^2, \\alpha^3, \\beta^2, \\beta^2\\alpha, \\beta^2\\alpha^2, \\beta^2\\alpha^3\\} \\) (see Exercise 77) and \\( \\alpha\\beta \\), which has order 3. Clearly, then, the rotations yield all 24 permutations, since the order of the rotation group must be divisible by both 8 and 3."

(The technical term for this solid is truncated icosahedron.) To determine the number of rotational symmetries of a soccer ball using Theorem 7.4, we may choose our set \\( S \\) to be the 20 hexagons or the 12 pentagons. Let us say that \\( S \\) is the set of 12 pentagons. Since any pentagon can be carried to any other pentagon by some rotation, the orbit of any pentagon is \\( S \\). Also, there are five rotations that fix (stabilize) any particular pentagon. Thus, by the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem, there are \\( 12 \\cdot 5 = 60 \\) rotational symmetries. (In case you are interested, the rotation group of a soccer ball is isomorphic to \\( A_{5} \\).)"

The structure of the new molecule was composed of 60 carbon atoms arranged in the shape of a soccer ball! Because the shape of the new molecule reminded them of the dome structures built by the architect R. Buckminster Fuller, Curl, Smalley, and Kroto named their discovery \"buckyballs.\" Buckyballs are the roundest, most symmetric large molecules known. Group theory has been particularly useful in illuminating the properties of buckyballs, since the absorption spectrum of a molecule depends on its symmetries and chemists classify various molecular states according to their symmetry properties. The buckyball discovery spurred a revolution in carbon chemistry. In 1996, Curl, Smalley, and Kroto received the Nobel Prize in chemistry for their discovery."

To carry out this effort, the research team of Morley Davidson, John Dethridge, Herbert Kociemba, and Tomas Rokicki applied a program of Rokicki, which built on early work of Kociemba, that checked the elements of the cosets of a subgroup \\( H \\) of order \\( (8! \\cdot 8! \\cdot 4!) / 2 = 19,508,428,800 \\) to see if each cube in a position corresponding to the elements in a coset could be solved within 20 moves. In the rare cases where Rokicki's program did not work, an alternate method was employed. Using symmetry considerations, they were able to reduce the approximately 2 billion cosets of \\( H \\) to about 56 million cosets for testing. Cosets played a role in this effort because Rokicki's program could handle the \\( 19.5+ \\) billion elements in the same coset in about 20 seconds."

He became captivated by mathematics at an early age when he read an essay by Halley on Newton's calculus. At the age of 19, he became a professor of mathematics at the Royal Artillery School in Turin. Lagrange made significant contributions to many branches of mathematics and physics, among them the theory of numbers, the theory of equations, ordinary and partial differential equations, the calculus of variations, analytic geometry, fluid dynamics, and celestial mechanics. His methods for solving third- and fourth-degree polynomial equations by radicals laid the groundwork for the group theoretic approach to solving polynomials taken by Galois."

In offering this appointment, Frederick the Great proclaimed that the \"greatest king in Europe\" ought to have the \"greatest mathematician in Europe\" at his court. In 1787, Lagrange was invited to Paris by Louis XVI and became a good friend of the king and his wife, Marie Antoinette. In 1793, Lagrange headed a commission, which included Laplace and Lavoisier, to devise a new system of weights and measures. Out of this came the metric system. Late in his life he was made a count by Napoleon. Lagrange died on April 10, 1813."

When you place an order with Amazon, the company sends your computer a randomly generated string of 0's and 1's called a key.

Suppose that you wanted to use your Twitter account to run a silent auction. How could a scheme be devised so that users could post their bids in such a way that the amounts are intelligible only to the account holder? In the mid-1970s, Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman devised an ingenious method that permits each person who is to receive a secret message to tell publicly how to scramble messages sent to him or her. And even though the method used to scramble the message is known publicly, only the person for whom it is intended will be able to unscramble the message. The idea is based on the fact that there exist efficient methods for finding very large prime numbers (say about 100 digits long) and for multiplying large numbers, but no one knows an efficient algorithm for factoring large integers (say about 200 digits long). The person who is to receive the message chooses a pair of large primes \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) and chooses an integer \\( e \\) (called the encryption exponent) with \\( 1 < e < m \\), where \\( m = \\operatorname{lcm}(p - 1, q - 1) \\), such that \\( e \\) is relatively prime to \\( m \\) (any such \\( e \\) will do). This person calculates \\( n = pq \\) (\\( n \\) is called the key) and announces that a message \\( M \\) is to be sent to him or her publicly as \\( M^e \\bmod n \\). Although \\( e \\), \\( n \\), and \\( M^e \\) are available to everyone, only the person who knows how to factor \\( n \\) as \\( pq \\) will be able to decipher the message."

So, the message YES becomes 250519. To keep the numbers involved from becoming too unwieldy, we send the message in blocks of four digits and fill in with blanks when needed. Thus, the message YES is represented by the two blocks 2505 and 1900. The person to whom the message is to be sent has picked two primes \\( p \\) and \\( q \\), say \\( p = 37 \\) and \\( q = 73 \\), and a number \\( e \\) that has no prime divisors in common with \\( \\operatorname{lcm}(p - 1, q - 1) = 72 \\), say \\( e = 5 \\), and has published \\( n = 37 \\cdot 73 = 2701 \\) and \\( e = 5 \\) in a public forum.

Suppose the wiring is done so that the light is on when both switches are in the up position. We can conveniently think of the states of the two switches as being matched with the elements of \\( Z_{2} \\oplus Z_{2} \\), with the two switches in the up position corresponding to \\( (0, 0) \\) and the two switches in the down position corresponding to \\( (1, 1) \\).

A similar analysis applies in the case of three switches, with the subgroup \\( \\{(0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 0), (0, 1, 1), (1, 0, 1)\\} \\) corresponding to the lights-on situation."

He spent 1976-1980 as professor of mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he met Ronald Rivest and Adi Shamir. Rivest and Shamir were attempting to devise a secure public key cryptosystem and asked Adleman if he could break their codes. Eventually, they invented what is now known as the RSA code that was simple to implement yet secure. In 1983, Adleman, Shamir, and Rivest formed the RSA Data Security company to license their algorithm. Their algorithm has become the primary cryptosystem used for security on the World Wide Web. They sold their company for $200 million in 1996."

When the subgroup \\( H \\) of \\( G \\) is normal, then the set of left (or right) cosets of \\( H \\) in \\( G \\) is itself a group—called the factor group of \\( G \\) by \\( H \\) (or the quotient group of \\( G \\) by \\( H \\)). Quite often, one can obtain information about a group by studying its factor groups. Indeed, as we will see in this and future chapters, normal subgroups have super powers. Theorem 9.3 is the first demonstration of these powers."

To do this, we assume that for some elements \\( a, a', b \\), and \\( b' \\) from \\( G \\), we have \\( aH = a'H \\) and \\( bH = b'H \\), and verify that \\( aHbH = a'Hb'H \\). That is, verify that \\( abH = a'b'H \\). (This shows that the definition of multiplication depends on only the cosets and not on the coset representatives.) From \\( aH = a'H \\) and \\( bH = b'H \\), we have \\( a' = ah_1 \\) and \\( b' = bh_2 \\) for some \\( h_1, h_2 \\) in \\( H \\), and therefore \\( a'b'H = ah_1bh_2H = ah_1bH = ah_1Hb = aHb = abH \\). Here we have made multiple use of associativity, property 2 of the lemma in Chapter 7, and the fact that \\( H \\triangleleft G \\). The rest is easy: \\( eH = H \\) is the identity; \\( a^{-1}H \\) is the inverse of \\( aH \\); and \\( (aHbH)cH = (ab)HcH = (ab)cH = a(bc)H = aH(bc)H = aH(bHcH) \\).

Second, in practice, it is the contrapositive of the theorem that is most often used—that is, if \\( G \\) is non-Abelian, then \\( G / Z(G) \\) is not cyclic. For example, it follows immediately from this statement and Lagrange's Theorem that a non-Abelian group of order \\( pq \\), where \\( p \\) and \\( q \\) are primes, must have a trivial center. Third, if \\( G / Z(G) \\) is cyclic, it must be trivial."

For example, properties 2 and 3 of Theorem 10.2 say that the homomorphic image of a cyclic group is cyclic and the homomorphic image of an Abelian group is Abelian. Property 4 of Theorem 10.2 says that the homomorphic image of a normal subgroup of \\( G \\) is normal in the image of \\( G \\). Property 5 of Theorem 10.2 says that if \\( \\phi \\) is a homomorphism from \\( G \\) to \\( \\overline{G} \\), then every element of \\( \\overline{G} \\) that gets \"hit\" by \\( \\phi \\) gets hit the same number of times as does the identity. Thus, the kernel of a group homomorphism measures how far off the homomorphism is from being one-to-one: the larger the kernel, the less the image resembles the group. The set \\( \\phi^{-1}(\\overline{g}) \\) defined in property 6 of Theorem 10.1 is called the inverse image of \\( \\overline{g} \\) (or the pullback of \\( \\overline{g} \\)). Note that the inverse image of an element is a coset of the kernel and that every element in that coset has the same image. Similarly, the set \\( \\phi^{-1}(\\overline{K}) \\) defined in property 8 of Theorem 10.2 is called the inverse image of \\( \\overline{K} \\) (or the pullback of \\( \\overline{K} \\))."

Now note that if \\( a = b \\mod 12 \\), then \\( a - b = 12t \\) for some integer \\( t \\) and this implies that \\( 5sa - 5sb = 5s(a - b) = 5s(12t) = 30(2st) = 0 \\mod 30 \\).

The next theorem shows that for any homomorphism \\( \\phi \\) of \\( G \\) and the normal subgroup \\( \\operatorname{Ker} \\phi \\), the same process produces a Cayley table isomorphic to the homomorphic image of \\( G \\). Thus, homomorphisms, like factor groups, cause a systematic collapse of a group to a simpler but closely related group. This can be likened to viewing a group through the reverse end of a telescope—the general features of the group are present, but the apparent size is diminished. The important relationship between homomorphisms and factor groups given below is often called the Fundamental Theorem of Group Homomorphisms."

So we may assume that all nonidentity elements have order 5 or 7. However, not all such elements can have order 5, since elements of order 5 come 4 at a time (if \\( |x| = 5 \\), then \\( |x^2| = |x^3| = |x^4| = 5 \\)) and 4 does not divide 34. Similarly, since 6 does not divide 34, not all nonidentity elements can have order 7. So, \\( G \\) has elements of order 7 and order 5. Since \\( G \\) has an element of order 7, it has a subgroup of order 7. Let us call it \\( H \\). In fact, \\( H \\) is the only subgroup of \\( G \\) of order 7, for if \\( K \\) is another subgroup of \\( G \\) of order 7, we have by Theorem 7.2 that \\( |HK| = |H||K| / |H \\cap K| = 7 \\cdot 7 / 1 = 49 \\).

It follows, then, that \\( C(H) = G \\) or \\( C(H) = H \\). If \\( C(H) = G \\), then we may obtain an element \\( x \\) of order 35 by letting \\( x = hk \\), where \\( h \\) is a nonidentity element of \\( H \\) and \\( k \\) has order 5. On the other hand, if \\( C(H) = H \\), then \\( |C(H)| = 7 \\) and \\( |N(H) / C(H)| = 35 / 7 = 5 \\). However, 5 does not divide \\( |\\operatorname{Aut}(H)| = |\\operatorname{Aut}(Z_7)| = 6 \\).

Why would one care to study a homomorphism of a group? The answer is that, just as was the case with factor groups of a group, homomorphic images of a group tell us some of the properties of the original group. One measure of the likeness of a group and its homomorphic image is the size of the kernel. If the kernel of the homomorphism of group \\( G \\) is the identity, then the image of \\( G \\) tells us everything (group theoretically) about \\( G \\) (the two being isomorphic). On the other hand, if the kernel of the homomorphism is \\( G \\) itself, then the image tells us nothing about \\( G \\). Between these two extremes, some information about \\( G \\) is preserved and some is lost. The utility of a particular homomorphism lies in its ability to preserve the group properties we want, while losing some inessential ones. In this way, we have replaced \\( G \\) by a group less complicated (and therefore easier to study) than \\( G \\); but, in the process, we have saved enough information to answer questions that we have about \\( G \\) itself. For example, if \\( G \\) is a group of order 60 and \\( G \\) has a homomorphic image of order 12 that is cyclic, then we know from properties 5, 8, and 9 of Theorem 10.2 that \\( G \\) has normal subgroups of orders 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and 60."

In 1874, after having taught at secondary school level for a short period, he was appointed to the University of Berlin as an extraordinary professor of mathematics. The next year Frobenius received an ordinary professorship at the Eidgenössische Polytechnikum in Zürich, where he stayed for seventeen years. His pioneering work on representation theory for finite groups had important applications in quantum mechanics and theoretical physics."

For example, if \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) belong to a ring, \\(a \\neq 0\\) and \\(ab = ac\\), we cannot conclude that \\(b = c\\). Similarly, if \\(a^2 = a\\), we cannot conclude that \\(a = 0\\) or 1 (as is the case with real numbers). In the first place, the ring need not have multiplicative cancellation, and in the second place, the ring need not have a multiplicative identity. There is an important class of rings that contains \\(Z\\) and \\(Z[x]\\) wherein multiplicative identities exist and for which multiplicative cancellation holds. This class is taken up in the next chapter."

During his school years he played football, hockey, golf, tennis, and pool. During this time he worked as a steeplejack and as a barber at a fair. Herstein received a B.S. degree from the University of Manitoba, an M.A. from the University of Toronto, and, in 1948, a Ph.D. degree from Indiana University under the supervision of Max Zorn. Before permanently settling at the University of Chicago in 1962, he held positions at the University of Kansas, the Ohio State University, the"

Herstein had great influence through his teaching and his collaboration with colleagues. He had 29 Ph.D. students, and traveled and lectured widely.

A ring is not the appropriate abstraction of the integers, however, because too much is lost in the process. Besides the two obvious properties of commutativity and existence of a unity, there is one other essential feature of the integers that rings in general do not enjoy—the cancellation property. In this chapter, we introduce integral domains—a particular class of rings that have all three of these properties. Integral domains play a prominent role in number theory and algebraic geometry."

But notice that when we say we can find all solutions in this manner, we are using the fact that the only way for a product to equal 0 is for one of the factors to be 0—that is, we are using the fact that \\( Z \\) is an integral domain. In \\( Z_{12} \\), there are many pairs of nonzero elements whose products are \\( 0: 2 \\cdot 6 = 0, 3 \\cdot 4 = 0, 4 \\cdot 6 = 0, 6 \\cdot 8 = 0 \\), and so on. So, how do we find all solutions of \\( x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0 \\) in \\( Z_{12} \\)? The easiest way is simply to try every element! Upon doing so, we find four solutions: \\( x = 1, x = 3, x = 7 \\), and \\( x = 9 \\). Observe that we can find all solutions of \\( x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0 \\) over \\( Z_{11} \\) or \\( Z_{13} \\), say, by setting the two factors \\( x - 3 \\) and \\( x - 1 \\) equal to 0. Of course, the reason this works for these rings is that they are integral domains. Perhaps this will convince you that integral domains are particularly advantageous rings. Table 13.2 gives a summary of some of the rings we have introduced and their properties."

By definition the elements of \\( R \\) have the form \\( f(x) + I \\) where \\( f(x) \\) is a polynomial with coefficients from \\( Z_{3} \\) but the important question is: What do the distinct cosets of \\( R \\) look like? The fact that \\( x^{2} + 1 + I = 0 + I \\) means that when dealing with coset representatives we may treat \\( x^{2} + 1 \\) as equivalent to 0 and therefore \\( x^{2} = -1 \\). For example, the coset \\( 2x^{2} + x + 1 + I = -2 + x + 1 + I = x - 1 + I \\). Moreover, when dealing with coset representatives we have \\( x^{2} = -1 \\) implies that \\( x^{3} = -x \\) and \\( x^{4} = 1 \\). So, \\( x^{4} + 2x^{3} + x^{2} + 2 + I = 1 - 2x - 1 + 2 + I = -2x + 2 + I = x + 2 + I \\) (because \\( -2 = 1 \\) in \\( Z_{3} \\)). In the same way, we have \\( x^{5} = x \\), \\( x^{6} = x^{2}x^{4} = -1 \\) and so on. Thus we see that \\( R = \\{ax + b + I \\mid a, b \\in Z_{3}\\} \\). This means that \\( R \\) has order 9. We can make one more simplification by suppressing the use of \\( I \\) and just refer to the coset \\( ax + b + I \\) as \\( ax + b \\). All we need to keep in mind is that when we perform the product \\( (ax + b)(cx + d) = acx^{2} + (ad + bc)x + bd \\) we replace \\( acx^{2} \\) with \\( -ac \\). We can now ask if any particular non-zero element of \\( R \\) is a unit or a zero-divisor. Consider \\( x + 1 \\). Note that \\( (x + 1)^{2} = x^{2} + 2x + 1 = 2x \\). Then \\( (x + 1)^{4} = (2x)^{2} = 4x^{2} = -1 \\). So, \\( x + 1 \\) is a unit and \\( |x + 1| = 8 \\). This means the eight non-zero elements of \\( R \\) form a cyclic group and \\( R \\) is a field of order 9."

In this way, we can show that every element of \\( R \\) is equal to one of the following cosets: \\( 0 + \\langle 2 - i \\rangle \\), \\( 1 + \\langle 2 - i \\rangle \\), \\( 2 + \\langle 2 - i \\rangle \\), \\( 3 + \\langle 2 - i \\rangle \\), \\( 4 + \\langle 2 - i \\rangle \\). Is any further reduction possible? To demonstrate that there is not, we will show that these five cosets are distinct. It suffices to show that \\( 1 + \\langle 2 - i \\rangle \\) has additive order 5. Since \\( 5(1 + \\langle 2 - i \\rangle) = 5 + \\langle 2 - i \\rangle = 0 + \\langle 2 - i \\rangle \\), \\( 1 + \\langle 2 - i \\rangle \\) has order 1 or 5. If the order is actually 1, then \\( 1 + \\langle 2 - i \\rangle = 0 + \\langle 2 - i \\rangle \\), so \\( 1 \\in \\langle 2 - i \\rangle \\). Thus \\( 1 = (2 - i)(a + bi) = 2a + b + (-a + 2b)i \\) for some integers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). But this equation implies that \\( 1 = 2a + b \\) and \\( 0 = -a + 2b \\), and solving these simultaneously yields \\( b = 1/5 \\), which is a contradiction. It should be clear that the ring \\( R \\) is essentially the field \\( Z_5 \\) in disguise."

His early interests were in chemistry and physics, but he obtained a doctor's degree in mathematics at the age of 21 under Gauss at the University of Göttingen. Dedekind continued his studies at Göttingen for a few years, and in 1854 he began to lecture there."

His work on unique factorization led to the modern theory of algebraic numbers. He was a pioneer in the theory of rings and fields. The notion of ideals as well as the term itself are attributed to Dedekind. Mathematics historian Morris Kline has called him \"the effective founder of abstract algebra.\""

The special case where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are restricted to 2 and 3 was first proved by the Rabbi Gersonides in the fourteenth century who proved for \\(m, n > 1\\) the only case when \\(2^{m} = 3^{n} \\pm 1\\) is for \\((m, n) = (3, 2)\\). To verify this is so for \\(2^{m} = 3^{n} + 1\\), observe that for all \\(n\\) we have \\(3^{n} \\mod 8 = 3\\) or 1. Thus, \\(3^{n} + 1 \\mod 8 = 4\\) or 2. On the other hand, for \\(m > 2\\), we have \\(2^{m} \\mod 8 = 0\\). To handle the case where \\(2^{m} = 3^{n} - 1\\), we first note that for all \\(n\\), \\(3^{n} \\mod 16 = 3, 9, 11\\), or 1, depending on the value of \\(n \\mod 4\\). Thus, \\((3^{n} - 1) \\mod 16 = 2, 8, 10\\), or 0. Since \\(2^{m} \\mod 16 = 0\\) for \\(m \\geq 4\\), we have ruled out the cases where \\(n \\mod 4 = 1, 2\\), or 3. Because \\(3^{4k} \\mod 5 = (3^{4})^{k} \\mod 5 = 1^{k} \\mod 5 = 1\\), we know that \\((3^{4k} - 1) \\mod 5 = 0\\). But the only values for \\(2^{m} \\mod 5\\) are 2, 4, 3, and 1. This contradiction completes the proof."

From 1923 until he emigrated to America in 1937, he was a professor at the University of Hamburg. After one year at Notre Dame, Artin went to Indiana University. In 1946 he moved to Princeton, where he stayed until 1958. The last four years of his career were spent where it began, at Hamburg. Artin's mathematics is both deep and broad.

We could have avoided the \\( x \\)'s by defining a polynomial as an infinite sequence \\( a_0, a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n, 0, 0, 0, \\ldots \\), but our method takes advantage of the student's experience in manipulating polynomials where \\( x \\) does represent a variable. The disadvantage of our method is that one must be careful not to confuse a polynomial with the function determined by a polynomial. For example, in \\( Z_3[x] \\), the polynomials \\( f(x) = x \\) and \\( g(x) = x^3 \\) determine the same function from \\( Z_3 \\) to \\( Z_3 \\), since \\( f(a) = g(a) \\) for all \\( a \\) in \\( Z_3 \\).

If \\( f(x) = 0 \\) or \\( \\deg f(x) < \\deg g(x) \\), we simply set \\( q(x) = 0 \\) and \\( r(x) = f(x) \\). So, we may assume that \\( n = \\deg f(x) \\geq \\deg g(x) = m \\) and let \\( f(x) = a_{n}x^{n} + \\dots + a_{0} \\) and \\( g(x) = b_{m}x^{m} + \\dots + b_{0} \\). The idea behind this proof is to begin just as if you were going to \"long divide\" \\( g(x) \\) into \\( f(x) \\), then use the Second Principle of Mathematical Induction on \\( \\deg f(x) \\) to finish up. Thus, resorting to long division, we let \\( f_{1}(x) = f(x) - a_{n}b_{m}^{-1}x^{n - m}g(x) \\). Then, \\( f_{1}(x) = 0 \\) or \\( \\deg f_{1}(x) < \\deg f(x) \\); so, by our induction hypothesis, there exist \\( q_{1}(x) \\) and \\( r_{1}(x) \\) in \\( F[x] \\) such that \\( f_{1}(x) = g(x)q_{1}(x) + r_{1}(x) \\), where \\( r_{1}(x) = 0 \\) or \\( \\deg r_{1}(x) < \\deg g(x) \\)."

In 1933, at the height of the Depression, he was newly married; despite having degrees from Yale, the University of Chicago, and the University of Göttingen, he had no prospects for a position at a college or university. After applying for employment as a master at a private preparatory school for boys, Mac Lane received a two-year instructorship at Harvard in 1934. He then spent a year at Cornell and a year at the University of Chicago before returning to Harvard in 1938. In 1947, he went back to Chicago permanently."

The probability of rolling a sum of 2 is \\( 1/36 \\), the probability of rolling a sum of 3 is \\( 2/36 \\), and so on. In a 1978 issue of Scientific American, Martin Gardner remarked that if one were to label the six faces of one cube with the integers 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4 and the six faces of another cube with the integers 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, then the probability of obtaining any particular sum with these dice (called Sicherman dice) would be the same as the probability of rolling that sum with ordinary dice (i.e., \\( 1/36 \\) for a 2, \\( 2/36 \\) for a 3, and so on). See Figure 17.1. In this example, we show how the Sicherman labels can be derived, and that they are the only possible such labels besides 1 through 6. To do so, we utilize the fact that \\( Z[x] \\) has the unique factorization property. To begin, let us ask ourselves how we may obtain a sum of 6, say, with an ordinary pair of dice. Well, there are five possibilities for the two faces: \\( (5,1) \\), \\( (4,2) \\), \\( (3,3) \\), \\( (2,4) \\), and \\( (1,5) \\). Next we consider the product of the two polynomials created by using the ordinary dice labels as exponents:"

In fact, three years earlier, Ernst Eduard Kummer had proved that this is not always the case. Undaunted by the failure of unique factorization, Kummer began developing a theory to \"save\" factorization by creating a new type of number. Within a few weeks of Lamé's announcement, Kummer had shown that Fermat's Last Theorem is true for all primes of a special type. This proved that the theorem was true for all exponents less than 100, prime or not, except for 37, 59, 67, and 74. Kummer's work has led to the theory of ideals as we know it today."

We will show that \\( a_0 \\) is a product of irreducibles (the product might consist of only one factor). We begin by showing that \\( a_0 \\) has at least one irreducible factor. If \\( a_0 \\) is irreducible, we are done. Thus, we may assume that \\( a_0 = b_1a_1 \\), where neither \\( b_1 \\) nor \\( a_1 \\) is a unit and \\( a_1 \\) is nonzero. If \\( a_1 \\) is not irreducible, then we can write \\( a_1 = b_2a_2 \\), where neither \\( b_2 \\) nor \\( a_2 \\) is a unit and \\( a_2 \\) is nonzero. Continuing in this fashion, we obtain a sequence \\( b_1, b_2, \\ldots \\) of elements that are not units in \\( D \\) and a sequence \\( a_0, a_1, a_2, \\ldots \\) of nonzero elements of \\( D \\) with \\( a_n = b_{n+1}a_{n+1} \\) for each \\( n \\). Hence, \\( \\langle a_0 \\rangle \\subset \\langle a_1 \\rangle \\subset \\dots \\) is a strictly increasing chain of ideals (see Exercise 5), which, by the preceding lemma, must be finite, say, \\( \\langle a_0 \\rangle \\subset \\langle a_1 \\rangle \\subset \\dots \\subset \\langle a_r \\rangle \\). In particular, \\( a_r \\) is an irreducible factor of \\( a_0 \\). This argument shows that every nonzero nonunit in \\( D \\) has at least one irreducible factor."

An integral domain with this property is called a Noetherian domain, in honor of Emmy Noether, who inaugurated the use of chain conditions in algebra. Noetherian domains are of the utmost importance in algebraic geometry. One reason for this is that, for many important rings \\( R \\), the polynomial ring \\( R[x] \\) is a Noetherian domain but not a principal ideal domain. One such example is \\( Z[x] \\).

Wiles's achievement was reported in newspapers and magazines around the world. The New York Times ran a front-page story on it, and one TV network announced it on the evening news.

Fermat obtained a Bachelor's degree in civil law from the University of Orleans in 1631. While earning his living practicing law he did mathematics as a hobby. Rather than proving and publishing theorems he sent the statements of his results and questions to leading mathematicians. One of his important observations is that any prime of the form \\(4k + 1\\) can be written as the sum of two squares in one and only one way, whereas a prime of the form \\(4k - 1\\) cannot be written as the sum of two squares in any manner whatever. Mathematics historian William Dunham asserts that Fermat's discovery of this dichotomy among primes ranks as one of the landmarks of number theory."

In 1989 the Institut de Mathétiques de Toulouse in France established the Fermat prize for research in fields in which Fermat made majors contributions. Among the recipients are Andrew Wiles and Richard Taylor."

With a precise definition of \"almost all,\" it can be shown that almost all real numbers are transcendental over \\( Q \\)."

For such an \\( E \\) to exist, it is necessary that every polynomial in \\( E[x] \\) splits in \\( E \\). Otherwise, it follows from Kronecker's Theorem that \\( E \\) would have a proper algebraic extension. This condition is also sufficient. If every member of \\( E[x] \\) splits in \\( E \\), and \\( K \\) is an algebraic extension of \\( E \\), then every member of \\( K \\) is a zero of some element of \\( E[x] \\). But the zeros of elements of \\( E[x] \\) are in \\( E \\). A field that has no proper algebraic extension is called algebraically closed. In 1910, Ernst Steinitz proved that every field \\( F \\) has a unique (up to isomorphism) algebraic extension that is algebraically closed. This field is called the algebraic closure of \\( F \\). A proof of this result requires a sophisticated set theory background. The algebraic closure of \\( Q \\) consists of those complex numbers that are zeros of some nonzero polynomial in one variable with rational coefficients. An example is \\( (\\sqrt[4]{\\sqrt{(3/2)} - \\sqrt[3]{-5}})/2 \\)."

In his classic textbook on Modern Algebra van der Waerden wrote: \"Almost all the notions and facts about fields which we teach our students in such a course, are contained in Steinitz's paper.\" Hulmut Hasse wrote in his textbook on Higher Algebra:"

Finite fields were first introduced by Galois in 1830 in his proof of the unsolvability of the general quintic equation. When Cayley invented matrices a few decades later, it was natural to investigate groups of matrices over finite fields. To this day, matrix groups over finite fields are among the most important classes of groups. In the past 70 years, there have been important applications of finite fields in computer science, coding theory, information theory, and cryptography. Recently finite fields of orders 4 and 16 have been used in analyzing strings of DNA. But, besides the many uses of finite fields in pure and applied mathematics, there is yet another good reason for studying them. They are just plain fun!"

To take advantage of this, we must first find a generator of this group. Since any element \\(\\mathrm{GF}(16)^*\\) must have a multiplicative order that divides 15, all we need to do is find an element in \\(\\mathrm{GF}(16)^*\\) whose order is not 1, 3, or 5. Our calculations have shown that \\(a\\) has these properties. So, we may think of \\(\\mathrm{GF}(16)\\) as the set \\(\\{0,1,a,a^2,\\ldots,a^{14}\\}\\), where \\(a^{15} = 1\\). This makes multiplication in \\(\\mathrm{GF}(16)\\) trivial, but, unfortunately, it makes addition more difficult. For example, \\(a^{10} \\cdot a^7 = a^{17} = a^2\\), but what is \\((a^{10} + a^7)^{-1}\\)? So, we face a dilemma. If we write the elements of \\(\\mathrm{GF}(16)\\) in the additive form \\(c_3a^3 + c_2a^2 + c_3a + c_4\\), then addition is easy and multiplication is hard. On the other hand, if we write the elements of \\(\\mathrm{GF}(16)^*\\) in the multiplicative form \\(a^i\\), then multiplication is easy and addition is hard. Can we have the best of both? Yes, we can. All we need to do is use the relation \\(a^4 = a + 1\\) to make a two-way conversion table, as in Table 21.1. So, we see from Table 21.1 that"

By the corollary of Theorem 21.3 the other irreducible factors of \\( x^{16} - x \\) have degrees 2 or 4. Fortunately, it is possible to determine these factors without resorting to long division. Since \\( x^{16} - x \\) has no multiple zeros in \\( \\mathrm{GF}(16) \\), it has no irreducible factors with multiplicity greater than 1. Because the sum of the degrees of the nonlinear irreducible factors of \\( x^{16} - x \\) must be 14, and 14 is not a multiple of 4, not all the irreducible factors can be quartics. Noting that the only irreducible quadratic over \\( Z_{2} \\) is \\( x^{2} + x + 1 \\), we know the irreducible factorization consists of it and three quartics. Finally, we observe that any quartic irreducible factor must begin with \\( x^{4} \\), end with 1, and have an odd number of terms in between (otherwise, 1 would be a zero). So, the remaining irreducible factors must be \\( x^{4} + x + 1 \\), \\( x^{4} + x^{2} + 1 \\), and \\( x^{4} + x^{3} + x^{2} + x + 1 \\) because these are only possibilities that meet the two stated necessary conditions."

They were especially interested in constructions that could be achieved using only a straightedge without markings and a compass. They knew, for example, that any angle can be bisected, and they knew how to construct an equilateral triangle, a square, a regular pentagon, and a regular hexagon. But they did not know how to trisect every angle or how to construct a regular seven-sided polygon (heptagon). Another problem that they attempted was the duplication of the cube—that is, given any cube, they tried to construct a new cube having twice the volume of the given one using only an unmarked straightedge and a compass. Legend has it that the ancient Athenians were told by the oracle at Delos that a plague would end if they constructed a new altar to Apollo in the shape of a cube with double the volume of the old altar, which was also a cube. Besides \"doubling the cube,\" the Greeks also attempted to \"square the circle\"—to construct a square with area equal to that of a given circle. They knew how to solve all these problems using other means, such as a compass and a straightedge with two marks, or an unmarked straightedge and a spiral, but they could not achieve any of the constructions with a compass and an unmarked straightedge alone. These problems vexed mathematicians for over 2000 years. The resolution of these perplexities was made possible when they were transferred from questions of geometry to questions of algebra in the 19th century."

In 1796, while still a teenager, Gauss showed that the 17-sided regular polygon is constructible. In 1801, he proved that a regular polygon of \\(n\\) sides is constructible if and only if \\(n\\) has the form \\(2^k p_1 p_2 \\cdots p_i\\), where the \\(p\\)'s are distinct"

It follows from plane geometry that if \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta (\\beta \\neq 0)\\) are constructible numbers, then so are \\(\\alpha + \\beta, \\alpha - \\beta, \\alpha \\cdot \\beta\\), and \\(\\alpha / \\beta\\).

To derive such a characterization, let \\(F\\) be any subfield of the reals. Call the subset \\(\\{(x, y) \\in R^2 \\mid x, y \\in F\\}\\) of the real plane the plane of \\(F\\), call any line joining two points in the plane of \\(F\\) a line in \\(F\\), and call any circle whose center is in the plane of \\(F\\) and whose radius is in \\(F\\) a circle in \\(F\\).

Finally, if we let \\( K \\) denote the normal subgroup of order 5 and let \\( H \\) denote any subgroup of order 8, then \\( G = HK \\). (See Example 5 in Chapter 9.) If \\( H \\) happens to be normal, we can say even more: \\( G = H \\times K \\)."

However, \\( G \\) cannot have both six subgroups of order 5 and 10 subgroups of order 3 (for then \\( G \\) would have more than 30 elements). Thus, the subgroup of order 3 is unique or the subgroup of order 5 is unique (or both are unique) and therefore is normal in \\( G \\). It follows, then, that the product of a subgroup of order 3 and one of order 5 is a group of order 15 that is both cyclic (Exercise 35) and normal (Exercise 9 in Chapter 9) in \\( G \\). [This, in turn, implies that both the subgroup of order 3 and the subgroup of order 5 are normal in \\( G \\) (Exercise 59 in Chapter 9).] So, if we let \\( y \\) be a generator of the cyclic subgroup of order 15 and let \\( x \\) be an element of order 2 (the existence of which is guaranteed by Cauchy's Theorem), we see that \\( G = \\{x^i y^j \\mid 0 \\leq i \\leq 1, 0 \\leq j \\leq 14\\} \\)."

During the school year 1862-1863, Sylow received a temporary appointment at Christiania University and gave lectures on Galois theory and permutation groups. Among his students that year was the great mathematician Sophus Lie (pronounced \"Lee\"), after whom Lie algebras and Lie groups are named. From 1873 to 1881, Sylow, with some help from Lie, prepared a new edition of Abel's works."

But what makes simple groups important in the theory of groups? They are important because they play a role in group theory somewhat analogous to that of primes in number theory or the elements in chemistry; that is, they serve as the building blocks for all groups. These building blocks may be determined in the following way. Given a finite group \\( G \\), choose a proper normal subgroup \\( G_{1} \\) of \\( G = G_{0} \\) of largest order. Then the factor group \\( G_{0} / G_{1} \\) is simple, and we next choose a proper normal subgroup \\( G_{2} \\) of \\( G_{1} \\) of largest order. Then \\( G_{1} / G_{2} \\) is also simple, and we continue in this fashion until we arrive at \\( G_{n} = \\{e\\} \\). The simple groups \\( G_{0} / G_{1}, G_{1} / G_{2}, \\ldots, G_{n - 1} / G_{n} \\) are called the composition factors of \\( G \\). More than 100 years ago, Jordan and Hölder proved that these factors are independent of the choices of the normal subgroups made in the process described. In a certain sense, a group can be reconstructed from its composition factors, and many of the properties of a group are determined by"

The next discoveries were made by Jordan in 1870, when he found four infinite families of simple matrix groups over the field \\( Z_{p} \\), where \\( p \\) is prime. One such family is the factor group \\( SL(n,Z_p) / Z(SL(n,Z_p)) \\), except when \\( n = 2 \\) and \\( p = 2 \\) or \\( p = 3 \\). Between the years 1892 and 1905, the American mathematician Leonard Dickson (see Chapter 21 for a biography) generalized Jordan's results to arbitrary finite fields and discovered several new infinite families of simple groups. About the same time, it was shown by G. A. Miller and F. N. Cole that a family of five groups first described by E. Mathieu in 1861 were in fact simple groups. Since these five groups were constructed by ad hoc methods that did not yield infinitely many possibilities, like \\( A_{n} \\) or the matrix groups over finite fields, they were called \"sporadic.\""

In that decade, many new infinite families of simple groups were found, and the initial steps down the long and winding road that led to the complete classification of all finite simple groups were taken. The first step was Richard Brauer's observation that the centralizer of an element of order 2 was an important tool for studying simple groups. A few years later, John Thompson, in his Ph.D. dissertation, introduced the crucial idea of studying the normalizers of various subgroups of prime-power order."

The proof of the Feit-Thompson Theorem filled an entire issue of a journal, 255 pages in all (see Figure 24.1). Writing in 2001, simple group theory expert Ronald Solomon said the theorem and its proof were \"a moment in the evolution of finite group theory analogous to the emergence of fish onto dry land.\""

Moreover, between 1966 and 1975, 19 new sporadic simple groups were discovered.

Here a program for the overall proof was laid out. The army of researchers now had a battle plan and a commander-in-chief. But this army still needed more and better weapons. Thus came the third critical development: the involvement of Michael Aschbacher. In a dazzling series of papers, Aschbacher combined his own insight with the methods of Thompson, which had been generalized throughout the 1960s, and a geometric approach pioneered by Bernd Fischer to achieve one brilliant result after another in rapid succession. In fact, so much progress was made by Aschbacher and others that by 1976, it was clear to nearly everyone involved that enough techniques had been developed to complete the classification. Only details remained."

Group theorists at long last had a list of all finite simple groups and a proof that the list was complete. The proof was spread out over hundreds of papers—both published and unpublished—and ran more than 10,000 pages in length. Because of the proof's extreme length and complexity, and the fact that some key parts of it had not been published, there was some concern in the mathematics community that the classification was not a certainty. By the end of the decade, group theorists had concluded that there was indeed a gap in the unpublished work that would be difficult to rectify. In the mid-1990s, Aschbacher and Stephen Smith began work on this problem. And, lo and behold, at the annual meeting of the American Mathematical Society in 2004, Aschbacher announced the coup de grêce that he and Smith had completed the classification. Their monograph is over 1200 pages in length. Ronald Solomon, writing in *Mathematical Reviews*, called it \"an amazing tour de force\" and a \"major milestone in the history of finite group theory.\" Aschbacher concluded his remarks by saying that he would not bet his house that the proof is now error free."

Since \\( |G| = 2n \\), Cauchy's Theorem guarantees that there is an element \\( g \\) in \\( G \\) of order 2. Then, when the permutation \\( T_g \\) is written in disjoint cycle form, each cycle must have length 1 or 2; otherwise, \\( |g| \\neq 2 \\). But \\( T_g \\) can contain no 1-cycles, because the 1-cycle \\( (x) \\) would mean \\( x = T_g(x) = gx \\), so \\( g = e \\). Thus, in cycle form, \\( T_g \\) consists of exactly \\( n \\) transpositions, where \\( n \\) is odd. Therefore, \\( T_g \\) is an odd permutation. This means that the set of even permutations in the image of \\( G \\) is a normal subgroup of index 2. (See Exercise 27 in Chapter 5 and Exercise 9 in Chapter 9.) Hence, \\( G \\) is not simple."

In 2011, Aschbacher received the $75,000 Rolf Schock Prize from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences for \"his fundamental contributions to one of the largest mathematical projects ever, the classification of finite simple groups.\" In 2012, he shared the $100,000 Wolf Prize for his work in the theory of finite groups and shared the American Mathematical Society's Steele Prize for Exposition."

Formally, of course, \\( G \\) is isomorphic to \\( F / N \\), where \\( F \\) is free on \\( \\{a, b\\} \\) and \\( N \\) is the smallest normal subgroup of \\( F \\) containing \\( b^{-2}a^2 \\) and \\( (ab)^{-2}a^2 \\). Now, let \\( H = \\langle b \\rangle \\) and \\( S = \\{H, aH\\} \\). Then, just as in Example 2, it follows that \\( S \\) is closed under multiplication by \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) from the left. So, as in Example 2, we have \\( G = H \\cup aH \\). Thus, we can determine the elements of \\( G \\) once we know exactly how many elements there are in \\( H \\). (Here again, the three relations come in.) To do this, first observe that \\( b^2 = (ab)^2 = abab \\) implies \\( b = aba \\). Then \\( a^2 = b^2 = (aba)(aba) = aba^2ba = ab^4a \\) and therefore \\( b^4 = e \\). Hence, \\( H \\) has at most four elements, and therefore \\( G \\) has at most eight—namely, \\( e, b, b^2, b^3, a, ab, ab^2 \\), and \\( ab^3 \\). It is conceivable, however, that not all of these eight elements are distinct. For example, \\( Z_2 \\oplus Z_2 \\) satisfies the defining relations and has only four elements. Perhaps it is the largest group satisfying the relations. How can we show that the eight elements listed above are distinct? Well, consider the group \\( \\bar{G} \\) generated by the matrices"

For relations we take strings \\( A = B \\), where \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are words in some fixed reference, say [2], and have the same pronunciation but different meanings (such words are called homophones). For example, \\( buy = by = bye \\), hour = our, lead = led, whole = hole. From these strings and cancellation, we obtain \\( u = e = h = a = w = \\theta \\) (\\( \\theta \\) is the identity string). With these examples in mind, we ask, What is the group given by these generators and relations? Surprisingly, the answer is the infinite cyclic group generated by \\( v \\). To verify this, one must show that every letter except \\( v \\) is equivalent to \\( \\theta \\) and that there are no two homophones that contain a different number of \\( v \\)'s. The former can easily be done with common words. For example, from \\( inn = in, plumb = plum \\), and \\( knot = not \\), we see that \\( n = b = k = \\theta \\). From too = to we have \\( o = \\theta \\). That there are no two homophones in [2] that have a different number of \\( v \\)'s can be verified by simply checking all cases. In contrast, the reference Handbook of Homophones by W. C. Townsend lists felt/verdt as homophones. Of course, including these makes the group trivial."

The principal advantage is that in many situations—particularly in knot theory, algebraic topology, and geometry—groups defined by way of generators and relations arise in a natural way. Within group theory itself, it is often convenient to construct examples and counterexamples with generators and relations. Among the disadvantages of defining a group by generators and relations is the fact that it is often difficult to decide whether or not the group is finite, or even whether or not a particular element is the identity. Furthermore, the same group can be defined with entirely different sets of generators and relations, and, given two groups defined by generators and relations, it is often extremely difficult to decide whether or not these two groups are isomorphic. Nowadays, these questions are frequently tackled with the aid of a computer."

After spending a year at Cambridge University, where he worked with Philip Hall, Harold Davenport, and G. H. Hardy, he returned to Yale for his Ph.D. degree. At the outbreak of World War II, he joined Naval Intelligence and had significant success in deciphering both the Japanese codes and the German Enigma messages. These successes helped to turn the tide of the war. After the war, Hall had faculty appointments at the Ohio State University, Caltech, and Emory University. He died on July 4, 1990."

His 1943 paper on projective planes ranks among the most cited papers in mathematics. Several fundamental concepts as well as a sporadic simple group are identified with Hall's name. One of Hall's most celebrated results is his solution to the \"Burnside Problem\" for exponent 6—that is, his proof that a finitely generated group in which the order of every element divides 6 must be finite. Hall influenced both John Thompson and Michael Aschbacher, two of finite group theory's greatest contributors. It was Hall who suggested Thompson's Ph.D. dissertation problem. Hall's Ph.D. students at Caltech included Donald Knuth and Robert McEliece."

A reflection across a line \\(L\\) is that transformation that leaves every point of \\(L\\) fixed and takes every point \\(Q\\), not on \\(L\\), to the point \\(Q'\\) so that \\(L\\) is the perpendicular bisector of the line segment from \\(Q\\) to \\(Q'\\) (see Figure 26.1). The line \\(L\\) is called the axis of reflection. In an \\(xy\\)-coordinate plane, the transformation \\((x,y) \\to (x,-y)\\) is a reflection across the \\(x\\)-axis, whereas \\((x,y) \\to (y,x)\\) is a reflection across the line \\(y = x\\). Some authors call an axis of reflective symmetry \\(L\\) a mirror because \\(L\\) acts like a two-sided mirror; that is, the image of a point \\(Q\\) in a mirror placed on the line \\(L\\) is, in fact, the image of \\(Q\\) under the reflection across the line \\(L\\). Reflections are called opposite isometries because they reverse orientation. For example, the reflected image of a clockwise spiral is a counterclockwise spiral. Similarly, the reflected image of a right hand is a left hand. (See Figure 26.1.)"

A glide-reflection is the product of a translation and a reflection across the line containing the translation line segment. This line is called the glide-axis.

We first observe that \\( G \\) cannot contain a translation or a glide-reflection, because in either case \\( G \\) would be infinite. Now observing that the composition of two reflections preserves orientation, we know that such a composition is a translation or rotation. When the two reflections have parallel axes of reflection, there is no fixed point so the composition is a translation. Thus, every two reflections in \\( G \\) have reflection axes that intersect in some point. We claim that all the axes of reflections intersect in the same point. Suppose that \\( f \\) and \\( f' \\) are two distinct reflections in \\( G \\). Then because \\( ff' \\) preserves orientation, we know that \\( ff' \\) is a rotation. We use the fact from geometry that a finite group of rotations must have a common center, say \\( P \\). This means that the axes of any two reflections must intersect at point \\( P \\). So, we have shown that all the elements of \\( G \\) have the common fixed point \\( P \\)."

We begin by singling out any one of the squares. Obviously, there are four rotations that map this square to itself, and the designated square can be rotated to the location of any of the other five. So, by the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem (Theorem 7.4), the rotation group has order \\( 4 \\cdot 6 = 24 \\). By Theorem 26.2, \\( G \\) is one of \\( Z_{24} \\), \\( D_{12} \\), and \\( S_4 \\). But each of the first two groups has exactly two elements of order 4, whereas \\( G \\) has more than two. So, \\( G \\) is isomorphic to \\( S_4 \\)."

Consider, for example, the task of coloring the six vertices of a regular hexagon so that three are black and three are white. Figure 27.1 shows the \\(\\binom{6}{3}=20\\) possibilities. However, if these designs appeared on one side of hexagonal ceramic tiles, it would be nonsensical to count the designs shown in Figure 27.1(a) as different, since all six designs shown there can be obtained from one of them by rotating. (A manufacturer would make only one of the six.) In this case, we say that the designs in Figure 27.1(a) are equivalent under the group of rotations of the hexagon. Similarly, the designs in Figure 27.1(b) are equivalent under the group of rotations, as are the designs in Figure 27.1(c) and those in Figure 27.1(d). And, since no design from Figure 27.1(a)-(d) can be obtained from a design in a different part by rotation, we see that the designs within each part of the figure are equivalent to each other but nonequivalent to any design in another part of the figure. However, the designs in Figure 27.1(b) and (c) are equivalent under the dihedral group \\(D_{6}\\), since the designs in Figure 27.1(b) can be reflected to yield the designs in Figure 27.1(c).

Suppose that we have the colors red (R), white (W), and blue (B) that can be used to color the edges of a regular tetrahedron (see Figure 5.1). First, observe that there are \\(3^{6} = 729\\) colorings without regard to equivalence. How shall we decide when two colorings of the tetrahedron are nonequivalent? Certainly, if we were to pick up a tetrahedron colored in a certain manner, rotate it, and put it back down, we would think of the tetrahedron as being positioned differently rather than as being colored differently (just as if we picked up a die labeled in the usual way and rolled it, we would not say that the die is now differently labeled). So, our permutation group for this problem is just the group of 12 rotations of the tetrahedron shown in Figure 5.1 and is isomorphic to \\(A_{4}\\). (The group consists of the identity; eight elements of order 3, each of which fixes one vertex; and three elements of order 2, each of which fixes no vertex.) Every rotation permutes the 729 colorings, and to apply Burnside's Theorem we must determine the size of \\(\\mathrm{fix}(\\phi)\\) for each of the 12 rotations of the group."

Since (234) carries edge 12 to edge 13, edge 13 to edge 14, and edge 14 to edge 12, these three edges must agree in color (edge \\( ij \\) is the edge joining vertex \\( i \\) and vertex \\( j \\)). The same argument shows that the three edges 23, 34, and 42 also must agree in color. So, \\( |\\mathrm{fix}(234)| = 3^2 \\), since there are three choices for each of these two sets of three edges. The nine columns in Table 27.3 show the possible colorings of the two sets of three edges. The analogous analysis applies to the other seven elements of order 3."

Of course, \\( b^{-1} \\) means traverse the \\( b \\) arc in reverse. (Observations such as \\( b^{-3} = b \\) also help.) Tracing the product through, we obtain \\( b \\).

One question about directed graphs that has been the object of much research was popularized by the Irish mathematician Sir William Hamilton in 1859, when he invented a puzzle called \"Around the World.\" His idea was to label the 20 vertices of a regular dodecahedron with the names of famous cities. One solves this puzzle by starting at any particular city (vertex) and traveling \"around the world,\" moving along the arcs in such a way that each other city is visited exactly once before returning to the original starting point. One solution to this puzzle is given in Figure 28.1, where the vertices are visited in the order indicated."

A sequence of arcs that passes through each vertex exactly once without returning to the starting point is called a Hamiltonian path.

Then the circuit must exit \\((a - 1, b + 1)\\) horizontally also, for otherwise the circuit passes through \\((a, b + 1)\\) twice—see Figure 28.5. Repeating this argument again and again, we see that the circuit exits horizontally from each of the vertices \\((a, b), (a - 1, b + 1), (a - 2, b + 2), \\ldots\\), which is just the coset \\((a, b) + \\langle (-1, 1) \\rangle\\). But when \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are relatively prime, \\(\\langle (-1, 1) \\rangle\\) is the entire group. Obviously, there cannot be a Hamiltonian circuit consisting entirely of horizontal moves.

A much more convenient way to describe a Hamiltonian path or circuit is to specify the starting vertex and the sequence of generators in the order in which they are to be applied. In Example 5, for instance, we may start at (1) and alternate the generators (12) and (13) until we return to (1). In Example 3, we may start at \\( R_0 \\) and successively apply \\( R_{90}, R_{90}, R_{90}, H, R_{90}, R_{90}, R_{90}, H \\). When \\( k \\) is a positive integer and \\( a, b, \\ldots, c \\) is a sequence of group elements, we use \\( k * (a, b, \\ldots, c) \\) to denote the concatenation of \\( k \\) copies of the sequence \\( (a, b, \\ldots, c) \\). Thus, \\( 2 * (R_{90}, R_{90}, R_{90}, H) \\) and \\( 2 * (3 * R_{90}, H) \\) both mean \\( R_{90}, R_{90}, R_{90}, H, R_{90}, R_{90}, R_{90}, H \\).

Starting from the identity element of \\( G \\), the path given by \\( (a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_k) \\) visits each element of \\( H \\) exactly once [because \\( (a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_k) \\) is a Hamiltonian path in \\( \\operatorname{Cay}(T:H) \\)]. The generator \\( s \\) then moves us to some element of the coset \\( Hs \\). Starting from there, the path \\( (a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_k) \\) visits each element of \\( Hs \\) exactly once. Then, \\( s \\) moves us to the coset \\( Hs^2 \\), and we visit each element of this coset exactly once. Continuing this process, we successively move to \\( Hs^3, Hs^4, \\ldots, Hs^n \\), visiting each vertex in each of these cosets exactly once.

One particular Cayley digraph that is used to design and analyze interconnection networks of parallel machines is the symmetric group \\( S_{n} \\) with the set of all transpositions as the generating set. Hamiltonian paths and circuits in Cayley digraphs arise in a variety of group theory contexts. A Hamiltonian path in a Cayley digraph of a group is simply an ordered listing of the group elements without repetition. The vertices of the digraph are the group elements, and the arcs of the path are generators of the group. In 1948, R. A. Rankin used these ideas (although not the terminology) to prove that certain bell-ringing exercises could not be done by the traditional methods employed by bell ringers. In 1981, Hamiltonian paths in Cayley digraphs were used in an algorithm for creating computer graphics of Escher-type repeating patterns in the hyperbolic plane. This program can produce repeating hyperbolic patterns in color from among various infinite classes of symmetry groups. The program has now been improved so that the user may choose from many kinds of color symmetry."

If the proposed landing site appears unfavorable, we will command the craft to orbit the planet; otherwise, we will command the craft to land. The signal for orbiting will be a 0, and the signal for landing will be a 1. But it is possible that some sort of interference (called noise) could cause an incorrect message to be received. To decrease the chance of this happening, redundancy is built into the transmission process. For example, if we wish the craft to orbit Mars, we could send five 0's. The craft's onboard computer is programmed to take any five-digit message received and decode the result by majority rule. So, if 00000 is sent and 10001 is received, the computer decides that 0 was the intended message. Notice that, for the computer to make the wrong decision, at least three errors must occur during transmission. If we assume that errors occur independently, it is less likely that three errors will occur than that two or fewer errors will occur. For this reason, this decision process is frequently called the maximum-likelihood decoding procedure. Our particular situation is illustrated in Figure 29.1. The general coding procedure is illustrated in Figure 29.2."

The first row of the table is the set \\(C\\) of code words, beginning in column 1 with the identity \\(0 \\cdots 0\\). To form additional rows of the table, choose an element \\(v\\) of \\(V\\) not listed in the table thus far. Among all the elements of the coset \\(v + C\\), choose one of minimum weight, say, \\(v'\\). Complete the next row of the table by placing under the column headed by the code word \\(c\\) the vector \\(v' + c\\). Continue this process until all the vectors in \\(V\\) have been listed in the table.

Disk drives pack data so densely that a read/write head can (almost) be excused if it can't tell where one bit stops and the next 1"

After passing her master's exam, she took a job as a research associate at Northwestern University while pursuing a Ph.D. there. In 1957, she obtained her degree.

Figure 30.1 depicts the lattice of subgroups of the group of field automorphisms of \\( Q(\\sqrt[4]{2}, i) \\). The integer along an upward lattice line from a group \\( H_1 \\) to a group \\( H_2 \\) is the index of \\( H_1 \\) in \\( H_2 \\). Figure 30.2 shows the lattice of subfields of \\( Q(\\sqrt[4]{2}, i) \\). The integer along an upward line from a field \\( K_1 \\) to a field \\( K_2 \\) is the degree of \\( K_2 \\) over \\( K_1 \\). Notice that the lattice in Figure 30.2 is the lattice of Figure 30.1 turned upside down. This is only one of many relationships between these two lattices. The Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory relates the lattice of subfields of an algebraic extension \\( E \\) of a field \\( F \\) to the subgroup structure of the group of automorphisms of \\( E \\) that send each element of \\( F \\) to itself. This relationship was discovered in the process of attempting to solve a polynomial equation \\( f(x) = 0 \\) by radicals."

In general, if \\( E \\) is an extension of \\( F \\), and we let \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) be the lattice of subfields of \\( E \\) containing \\( F \\) and let \\( \\mathcal{G} \\) be the lattice of subgroups of \\( \\operatorname{Gal}(E / F) \\), then for each \\( K \\) in \\( \\mathcal{F} \\), the group \\( \\operatorname{Gal}(E / K) \\) is in \\( \\mathcal{G} \\), and for each \\( H \\) in \\( \\mathcal{G} \\), the field \\( E_H \\) is in \\( \\mathcal{F} \\). Thus, we may define a mapping \\( g: \\mathcal{F} \\to \\mathcal{G} \\) by \\( g(K) = \\operatorname{Gal}(E / K) \\) and a mapping \\( f: \\mathcal{G} \\to \\mathcal{F} \\) by \\( f(H) = E_H \\). It is easy to show that if \\( K \\) and \\( L \\) belong to \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) and \\( K \\subseteq L \\), then \\( g(K) \\supseteq g(L) \\). Similarly, if \\( G \\) and \\( H \\) belong to \\( \\mathcal{G} \\) and \\( G \\subseteq H \\), then \\( f(G) \\supseteq f(H) \\). Thus, \\( f \\) and \\( g \\) are inclusion-reversing mappings between \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) and \\( \\mathcal{G} \\). We leave it to the reader to show that for any \\( K \\) in \\( \\mathcal{F} \\), we have \\( (fg)(K) \\supseteq K \\), and for any \\( G \\) in \\( \\mathcal{G} \\), we have \\( (gf)(G) \\supseteq G \\). When \\( E \\) is an arbitrary extension of \\( F \\), these inclusions may be strict. However, when \\( E \\) is a suitably chosen extension of \\( F \\), the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory, Theorem 30.1, says that \\( f \\) and \\( g \\) are inverses of each other, so that the inclusions are equalities. In particular, \\( f \\) and \\( g \\) are inclusion-reversing isomorphisms between the lattices \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) and \\( \\mathcal{G} \\). A stronger result than that given in Theorem 30.1 is true, but our theorem illustrates the fundamental principles involved."

Since any automorphism of \\( K = Q(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5) \\) is completely determined by its action on the \\( a \\)'s and must permute the \\( a \\)'s, we know that \\( \\operatorname{Gal}(K / Q) \\) is isomorphic to a subgroup of \\( S_5 \\), the symmetric group on five symbols. Since \\( a_1 \\) is a zero of an irreducible polynomial of degree 5 over \\( Q \\), we know that \\( [Q(a_1):Q] = 5 \\), and therefore 5 divides \\( [K:Q] \\). Thus, the Fundamental Theorem of Galois Theory tells us that 5 also divides \\( |\\operatorname{Gal}(K / Q)| \\). So, by Cauchy's Theorem (corollary to Theorem 24.3), we may conclude that \\( \\operatorname{Gal}(K / Q) \\) has an element of order 5. Since the only elements in \\( S_5 \\) of order 5 are the 5-cycles, we know that \\( \\operatorname{Gal}(K / Q) \\) contains a 5-cycle. The mapping from \\( \\mathbf{C} \\) to \\( \\mathbf{C} \\), sending \\( a + bi \\) to \\( a - bi \\), is also an element of \\( \\operatorname{Gal}(K / Q) \\). Since this mapping fixes the three real zeros and interchanges the two complex zeros of \\( g(x) \\), we know that \\( \\operatorname{Gal}(K / Q) \\) contains a 2-cycle. But, the only subgroup of \\( S_5 \\) that contains both a 5-cycle and a 2-cycle is \\( S_5 \\). (See Exercise 25 in Chapter 24.) So, \\( \\operatorname{Gal}(K / Q) \\) is isomorphic to \\( S_5 \\). Finally, since \\( S_5 \\) is not solvable (see Exercise 27), we have succeeded in exhibiting a fifth-degree polynomial that is not solvable by radicals."

And, given a construction of a regular \\( n \\)-gon, it is easy to construct a regular \\( 2n \\)-gon. The Greeks attempted to fill in the gaps (7, 9, 11, 13, 14, 17, . . .) but failed. More than 2200 years passed before anyone was able to advance our knowledge of this problem beyond that of the Greeks. Incredibly, Gauss, at age 19, showed that a regular 17-gon is constructible, and shortly thereafter he completely solved the problem of exactly which \\( n \\)-gons are constructible. It was this discovery of the 17-sided regular polygon that induced Gauss to dedicate his life to the study of mathematics. Gauss was so proud of this accomplishment that he requested that a regular 17-sided polygon be engraved on his tombstone."

Let \\(\\omega\\) be a primitive \\(n\\)th root of unity that is a zero of \\(f(x)\\). Then \\(f(x)\\) is the minimal polynomial for \\(\\omega\\) over \\(Q\\). Let \\(p\\) be any prime that does not divide \\(n\\). Then, by Corollary 3 of Theorem 4.2, \\(\\omega^p\\) is also a primitive \\(n\\)th root of unity, and therefore \\(0 = (\\omega^p)^n - 1 = f(\\omega^p)g(\\omega^p)\\), and so \\(f(\\omega^p) = 0\\) or \\(g(\\omega^p) = 0\\). Suppose \\(f(\\omega^p) \\neq 0\\). Then \\(g(\\omega^p) = 0\\), and so \\(\\omega\\) is a zero of \\(g(x^p)\\). Thus, from Theorem 21.3, \\(f(x)\\) divides \\(g(x^p)\\) in \\(Q[x]\\). Since \\(f(x)\\) is monic, \\(f(x)\\) actually divides \\(g(x^p)\\) in \\(Z[x]\\) (see Exercise 71 in Chapter 16). Say \\(g(x^p) = f(x)h(x)\\), where \\(h(x) \\in Z[x]\\). Now let \\(\\overline{g}(x), \\overline{f}(x)\\), and \\(\\overline{h}(x)\\) denote the polynomials in \\(Z_p[x]\\) obtained from \\(g(x), f(x)\\), and \\(h(x)\\), respectively, by reducing each coefficient modulo \\(p\\). From Exercise 13 in Chapter 16 and Corollary 5 of Theorem 7.1, we then have \\((\\overline{g}(x))^p = \\overline{g}(x^p) = \\overline{f}(x)\\overline{h}(x)\\), and since \\(Z_p[x]\\) is a unique factorization domain, it follows that \\(\\overline{g}(x)\\) and \\(\\overline{f}(x)\\) have an irreducible factor in \\(Z_p[x]\\) in common; call it \\(m(x)\\). Thus, we may write \\(\\overline{f}(x) = k_1(x)m(x)\\) and \\(\\overline{g}(x) = k_2(x)m(x)\\), where \\(k_1(x), k_2(x) \\in Z_p[x]\\). Then, viewing \\(x^n - 1\\) as a member of \\(Z_p[x]\\), we have \\(x^n - 1 = \\overline{f}(x)\\overline{g}(x) = k_1(x)k_2(x)(m(x))^2\\). In particular, \\(x^n - 1\\) has a multiple zero in some extension of \\(Z_p\\). But because \\(p\\) does not divide \\(n\\), the derivative \\(nx^{n-1}\\) or \\(x^n - 1\\) is not 0, and so \\(nx^{n-1}\\) and \\(x^n - 1\\) do not have a common factor of positive degree in \\(Z_p[x]\\).

While still a teenager, he made many fundamental discoveries. Among these were the method of \"least squares\" for handling statistical data, and a proof that a 17-sided regular polygon can be constructed with a straightedge and compass (this result was the first of its kind since discoveries by the Greeks 2000 years earlier). In his Ph.D. dissertation in 1799, he proved the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra."

After graduating from Harvard in 1996, Bhargava went to Princeton to pursue his Ph.D. under the direction of Andrew Wiles (see biography after Chapter 18). Bhargava investigated a \"composition law\" first formulated by Gauss in 1801 for combining two quadratic equations (equations in a form such as \\( x^{2} + 3xy + 6y^{2} = 0 \\)) in a way that was very different from normal addition and revealed a lot of information about number systems. Bhargava tackled an aspect of the problem in which no progress had been made in more than 200 years. He not only broke new ground in that area but also discovered 13 more composition laws and developed a coherent mathematical framework to explain them. He then applied his theory of composition to solve a number of fundamental problems concerning the distribution of extension fields of the rational numbers and of other, related algebraic objects. What made Bhargava's work especially remarkable is that he was able to explain"

But \\(|H_1H_2| = 2^{m - 1} \\cdot 2^{n - 1} = 2^{m + n - 2}\\) exceeds \\(|H| = 2^{m + n - 3}\\). The argument works for any prime \\(p\\)."

Now go across the direct product and, for each distinct prime you have, pick off the largest factor of the prime power. Next, combine all of these into one factor (you can do this, since the subscripts are relatively prime). Let us call the order of this new factor \\( n_1 \\). Now repeat this process with the remaining original factors and call the order of the resulting factor \\( n_2 \\). Then \\( n_2 \\) divides \\( n_1 \\), since each prime-power divisor of \\( n_2 \\) is also a prime-power divisor of \\( n_1 \\). Continue in this fashion. Example: If \\( G \\approx Z_{27} \\oplus Z_3 \\oplus Z_{125} \\oplus Z_{25} \\oplus Z_4 \\oplus Z_2 \\oplus Z_2 \\), then \\( G \\approx Z_{27.125.4} \\oplus Z_{3.25.2} \\oplus Z_2 \\).
