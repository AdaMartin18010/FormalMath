Consequently, the overall model assessment must also address these modelling assumptions and their formalisation. Errors arising from the violation of modelling assumptions are particularly significant because they make the model conceptually wrong. Moreover, while the practical use of such a wrong model might still be correct from the algorithmic perspective, the results it produces are meaningless. Consequently, addressing conceptual modelling errors requires a deeper understanding of the model creation process, particularly in the case of coupled problems where multiple models need to be coupled."

After discussing individual mathematical models, the framework addresses the coupling of models, demonstrating that the categorical structure for coupled mathematical models is more complicated.

Furthermore, model properties, such as for example model uncertainty and model robustness, are discussed and evaluated with respect to their potential for formalisation within the category theory-based modelling framework. This discussion leads to the classification of model properties into universal model properties and applied model properties. At the end of this chapter, applications of the category theory-based modelling framework to practical problems of bridge aerodynamics and to the development of coupled solution methods are presented."

We start with a general discussion on models and modelling process within the engineering context. We then discuss the model consistency and the modelling errors that may arise during the modelling process. Specifically, we emphasise that it is necessary to distinguish between the conceptual modelling errors, which appear because of violating basic modelling assumptions, and the instance modelling errors, which are related to the practical implementation of models. After that, we provide a brief overview of the conceptual modelling approaches, which could help us to evaluate models with respect to their coherence, as well as provide possibilities for a more formal description of the model creation process."

The ultimate goal of the modelling process, however, is not merely create the model but to analyse it and draw conclusions about the engineering system. Looking more generally at the modelling process, it is safe to assume that the final objective of the modelling process is to describe a certain real-world phenomenon. Hence, independent of the model type, a model is required to describe this real-world phenomenon, or, in other words, approximate the reality [4, 46]. However, before creating a model, it is essential to clearly formulate a modelling task that includes parameters and effects the model must encompass. In this regard, the output of the modelling process—the final model—must be evaluated with respect to the modelling task formulated in the beginning. This model evaluation aims at assessing model quality, or, in other words, to \"measure\" how adequate the model represents the physical phenomenon under consideration. Figure 1.1 schematically illustrates a general framework of the modelling process, indicating that the model quality assessment requires not only the final result (the model itself), but also the initial modelling task; otherwise, criteria for assessing the model would be undefined."

However, if we are interested in modelling of only a single beam, then the global model would consist of only one partial model in this case. In this context, the primary difference between global model and a coupled model is that a \"global model\" represents a complete model of a real object, whereas a coupled model may be an incomplete model that combines several partial models. Figure 1.2 presents this general approach of describing a real object with the help of coupled partial models."

Additionally, with the growing complexity of engineering problems nowadays, the number of critical points that can lead to conceptual modelling errors, as discussed above, also increases. Because conceptual modelling errors appear on the early stage in the modelling process, their impact on the quality of the final result is much more profound. Moreover, as it has been indicated by the examples, conceptual modelling errors do not necessarily make the model formulation wrong (differential equation in the examples), but rather make the results of computations with this model formulation meaningless. Because of that reason, detection of conceptual modelling errors is much more complicated. In particular, it is not possible to look only at the final model formulations for detecting such errors, but rather necessary to understand how the model creation process works and what assumptions have been used, and if they can be alternated without violating the model correctness."

The reason for this fine tuning is motivated by the fact that the same differential equation can describe different physical phenomena depending on the specific practical application.

Without this understanding, it is impossible to assess whether the final model is free from conceptual modelling errors or to evaluate the model's quality with respect to the fulfilment of the original modelling task. Consequently, it is not surprising that in recent years, several attempts to develop modelling frameworks that clearly describe the structure of coupled models, along with methodologies for evaluation and guidance of engineering modelling, have been performed. In this section, without pretending to be complete, we provide a short overview (not in a chronological order) of existing approaches to conceptual modelling and model evaluation in engineering. Moreover, we review these approaches with respect to their applicability to the conceptual modelling phase and their potential for detecting conceptual modelling errors, or providing hints towards this detection."

However, it lacks universality in the sense, that the model sensitivity depends on specific boundary and initial conditions. It is easy to construct situations where, for the same model but with different boundary/initial conditions, the significance of various model parameters differs. In this regard, the graph theory-based framework for model assessment coupled with the model sensitivity addresses engineering practice, but is not \"abstract enough\" to address also the conceptual modelling of engineering systems or to provide hints towards conceptual modelling errors detection."

Working with discrete optimisation problems would work perfectly well when the graph-theoretic approach is used to evaluate quality of data-driven models, as it has been mentioned above.

However, the application of model theory and the lower predicate calculus typically requires extensive formal constructions, making it less applicable in practice, particularly for models described by partial differential equations. Nonetheless, in the field of modelling of dynamical systems, predicate logic and metalanguages have shown their usefulness, see [43-45] and references therein. In these works, it has been shown that system models can be turned into logical equations, resulting in the fact that many important properties of these models can be proved by studying the corresponding logical equations. In this book, we will not use model theory and predicate logic to address the conceptual modelling phase. Instead, we will work with similar formal theories, such as type theory [35] and lambda calculus [5], in Chap. 5, where these theories are utilised to detect conceptual modelling errors in practice. Furthermore, considering that there is a connection between logic and type theory, then it is possible to see that the type theory-based approach is a kind of alternative to [43-45], and that perhaps there is a way to utilise advantages of both by connecting them."

Conceptual modelling languages allow capturing the semantics of applications through formal notations in order to achieve a more natural and direct modelling of aspects of the engineering systems. Common conceptual modelling languages include, for example, the Entity-Relationship model, the Enhanced Entity-Relationship model, Unified Modeling Language class diagrams, Object-Role Modeling (ORM), and Second Generation ORM [20]. However, by their construction, conceptual modelling languages do not address the issue of the modelling errors detection, because the modelling process is not really addressed by the conceptual modelling languages. Additionally, the applicability of modelling languages to describe a general semantic of physics-based models is not entirely clear."

Modern modelling languages actually do support modelling at a high level of abstraction, through (undirected) equations or equivalent diagrams, but they are still primarily intended for practical modelling: ultimately the goal is to generate working simulation (or other) code. Consequently, many aspects of such languages are geared towards supporting that goal, meaning that models often become less abstract and more operational than they could be. Moreover, the kinds of equations supported are limited, such as differential-algebraic equations in the case of Modelica with some limited extensions to partial differential equations [37], which are numerically treated. That means that many problems in the wider setting of mathematical physics, like boundary value problems of elasticity theory, fluid"

Several attempts in this direction have been presented in recent years: see for example works [26] and [6] for applications in the fields of cyber-system modelling and Unified Modelling Language, respectively. In the context of this book, the use of type theory is particularly important. In the context of modelling languages it means, that the type system of a modelling language must be appropriately designed: by static checking of model derivation, it can be ensured that the conceptual modelling has been carried out such that the resulting multiphysics model does not contradict basic physical laws and assumptions before preparing simulation code. Originating from the Functional Reactive Programming [29], Functional Hybrid Modelling (FHM) [10, 30] is a first step in the development of a Haskell-based modelling language with a robust type system allowing us to detect modelling errors more effectively compared to the type systems in the traditional modelling languages. In essence, FHM enriches Haskell with a notion of first-class equations for modelling of physical systems. Haskell provides the required abstraction mechanisms and means for constructing systems by composing equation system fragments. While, in terms of language design and modelling aims, FHM is similar to Modelica and thus suffers the same limitations, the design of FHM can serve as a blueprint for a language for modelling systems in the abstract, demonstrating the usefulness of Haskell for this kind of modelling language research and design. First steps in extension of the FHM to realistic models appearing in engineering will be presented in Chap. 5."

Next, lattice of theories concept is also important for some parts of this book, therefore it will be introduced in this chapter as well. After that, this chapter presents categorical ontology logs, or simply ologs, which combine flexibility of classical all-purpose ontologies and mathematical rigorosity of category theory. Finally, we discuss some classical and more recent applications of category theory focusing in particular on applications related to conceptual modelling."

In general words, category theory provides a language which helps to describe properties of different objects by using their representation with diagrams of arrows. In this case, each arrow represents a function (mapping) between two objects. Before starting with basic definitions from category theory, we would like to recall two important principles of category theory [25]:"

Thus, one of the first applications of category theory apart from the algebraic topology was foundation of mathematics. For example, in [20] the notion of a topos has been introduced. The idea was to view the abstract concept of an arrow in a category as a replacement of the set membership relation. With this idea in mind, the logic has been analysed from the categorical point of view. Additionally, it is worth mentioning that there exists a category of proofs for a deductive system of logic [3]. The objects in this category are formulae:"

Nowadays, category theory is seen in a more general context than \"only\" foundations for mathematics, but rather as a possible foundation for science in general, see works [27, 30] and reference therein for the details. Additionally, in [22], category theory has been used for development of a framework for concept discovery in science and technology. This work underlines the fundamental nature of category theory as a possible basis for science."

Especially, applications of category theory to model-driven engineering have been proposed in [13, 26, 28]. However, the most attention in these works has been drawn to software engineering from a computer science point of view. Several authors have also studied the use of category theory to applications in system engineering, see for example works [2, 9, 10, 15, 31]. These works clearly show the usefulness of category theory when describing complex systems. Moreover, it is interesting to note that the approaches of using category theory for modelling purposes vary depending on the authors' ideas. This fact underlines the fruitfulness and flexibility of category theory even when considering the same area of applications."

At first, a categorical description of mathematical models is introduced, and their properties are discussed. After that, coupled models are addressed by lifting the results from categories of mathematical models to the categories of coupled models. However, because of the coupling, the structure of categories of coupled models is more complicated. In particular, it is necessary to distinguish if models from the same or from different categories are coupled. Finally, more abstract categorical constructions on categories of mathematical models are discussed. For supporting the reader, the chapter is provided with various illustrative examples for practical interpretations of the abstract constructions introduced in this chapter."

The category theory-based modelling framework presented in this chapter aims to provide a consistent description of models and their couplings in the language of category theory. Abstract categorical descriptions require first the definition of universal properties of models—properties which are shared by models in general and are independent on any specific problem or engineering field. If a universal model property is defined, then all categorical constructions used in one specific modelling application can be directly transferred to another field. Thus, the category theory-based modelling framework begins with defining such a universal model property which is common across all models. Furthermore, the main goal is also to ensure that the constructions introduced in the framework retain meaningful physical and engineering interpretations, bridging the abstract theory with practical applications. Hence, we will provide illustrative examples alongside the abstract categorical constructions."

Hence, the process of formalisation of the sets of assumptions in terms of final equations describing transverse vibrations of one-dimensional beams will be highlighted."

Although from the set-theoretic point of view such freedom in writing sets of assumptions is not completely justified, it is acceptable in our setting because each set of assumption written in natural language can be rigorously formalised in terms of mathematical expressions. Thus, writing mathematical expressions in sets of assumptions can be considered as a kind of syntactic sugar, similar to programming"

Furthermore, the example of objects \\(\\mathbf{Set}_{\\mathrm{LE}}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{Set}_{\\mathrm{LEF}}\\) indicates once more that it is not sufficient to look only at the final model formulations, such as differential equations. As demonstrated by this example, the basic equations remain identical, and the only difference comes from the presence of cracks. Similarly, it is also not sufficient to look only at boundary conditions. For instance, a typical boundary condition for crack faces, which are a part of the boundary, is the traction-free condition implying that normal stresses are zero on crack surfaces. However, zero normal stresses boundary condition on parts of a boundary are a typical condition in many boundary value problems. Therefore, for distinguishing different mathematical models, it is absolutely necessary to analyse the basic modelling assumptions, and not only the final form of equations."

Consequently, it becomes necessary to extend the categorical perspective on mathematical models presented in previous sections to encompass coupled mathematical models. The idea behind this extension is to preserve the general framework established for categories of individual mathematical models, and elevate it to the level of coupled models. In this way, all constructions introduced for categories of mathematical models in Sect. 3.2 can also be preserved and applied at the level of coupled mathematical models. However, because of a more complicated structure of coupled models, the notions of model complexity and convertibility will also become more technical, as we will see throughout the upcoming sections."

However, from the modelling perspective, the sets of assumptions of individual models are not really modified, but rather extra coupling conditions are added to both sets. Nonetheless, the construction of sets of assumptions of coupled models by using functors does not exclude this situation, because modification of objects \\(\\mathbf{Set}_i\\), \\(\\mathbf{Set}_j\\) by functors implies adding something more to the both objects. However, for the sake of clarity, the fact that coupling is more than just a union has been stated explicitly in Definition 3.6 in the construction of objects \\(\\mathbf{Set}_{i,j}\\)."

The first statement can be straightforwardly proved by assuming the contrary—both sets \\(\\mathbf{Set}_i^{\\mathrm{Coup}}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{Set}_j^{\\mathrm{Coup}}\\) are empty sets. This implies that the relations (3.5) are not satisfied, because the relation b) does not hold in the case \\(\\mathbf{Set}_{ij}^{\\mathrm{Coup}} = \\emptyset\\). Thus, both sets cannot be empty simultaneously. Practically it means again, that a coupling of models is not just a union of two models (the case corresponding to both sets \\(\\mathbf{Set}_i^{\\mathrm{Coup}}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{Set}_j^{\\mathrm{Coup}}\\) being empty), but it requires formulating extra coupling conditions to satisfy the relations (3.5)."

From this construction, it follows that sets \\(\\mathbf{Set}_i \\cup \\mathbf{Set}_j\\) and \\(\\mathbf{Set}_{ij}^{\\mathrm{Coup}}\\) are considered independently, and hence, various combinations of cases 2 and 3 can be constructed without any extra conditions.

Hence, we can construct an equaliser in Heat by selecting any subset of Set<sub>UH</sub>. Practically it means, that a universal arrow denoted by \\( e \\) in Heat takes any subset of basic assumptions Set<sub>UH</sub>, which is not associated to any mathematical model of a heat conduction process, and extends it to the initial object of Heat and further satisfies the relation \\( g \\circ e = h \\circ e \\)."

To this end, we introduce the category ThermoElast, containing sets of assumptions corresponding to various thermoelasticity models. However, before presenting the structure of this category, we first recall some basic concepts of thermoelasticity. For keeping presentation short, we will only provide the final forms of equations along with brief comments on their constructions. For a more detailed information on thermoelasticity, we refer the reader to [12, 14]."

This is clearly visible from Table 3.4. Consequently, when discussing the coupling of objects of Heat and Elast, we will omit the object SetNE, which is related to the nonlinear model of elasticity. Additionally, as discussed above, for each coupled model associated with the objects of product category ThermoElast there are three sets of coupling conditions SetCoupCDT, SetCQST, and SetDT, reflecting different levels of coupling complexity. Thus, the product category ThermoElast is formally given according to Definition 3.6 as follows"

Therefore, the approach to coupling several categories of mathematical models presented in Fig. 3.2 seems to be more transparent and provides a better internal structure for the respective categories of coupled mathematical models. Furthermore, in some applications, the order of model coupling might be predetermined from the beginning. For instance, geometrical restrictions can fix the order when constructing a global model of a building by sequentially coupling models for individual storeys."

The goal here is to grasp the essential ideas of these constructions in simpler formulations motivated by the engineering perspective. These formulations remain accurate, but are free of too many formal constructions. Consequently, the practical applicability of the category theory-based modelling framework proposed in this book will be increased. After that, we discuss some further model properties, such as for example model uncertainty and model robustness, and evaluate them with respect to their potential for formalisation within the category theory-based modelling framework. Additionally, we explore a more abstract perspective on model comparison and model evaluation. Finally, the chapter concludes with an application of the category theory-based modelling framework to practical problems of bridge aerodynamics and a discussion of how the categorical modelling perspective can support the development of solution methods for coupled problems in practice."

Furthermore, for a better readability of this section, we will provide all analogues in the form of separate definitions, although these definitions may not necessarily really define particular objects. Additionally, where it is necessary, we will explore the connection between the formal definition and its simplified analogue in more details."

The fidelity itself can be seen as the distance between a model and the system it represents [6]. The term \"distance\" suggests that there exists a way to quantify the difference between the model and reality. In contrast, the model complexity, as introduced in Definition 3.2 and revisit in Definition 4.2, addresses this \"distance\" at the level of modelling assumptions. For example, if we are interested in the modelling of a non-linear phenomenon, but we choose a linear model, then it is evident from the beginning, that the model fidelity cannot be high in this case. Thus, model complexity provides a general setting for the range of applications for a given model. However, it is still possible to quantify the influence of specific modelling assumptions on the fidelity of the resulting model. We will introduce more formal definitions for such quantifications in Sect. 4.2 and present a practical engineering example in Sect. 4.3."

This is exactly the ground where the model complexity starts to be confused with computational complexity or the overall complexity of a solution procedure. However, for a deeper understanding of models and their practical use, it is critical to keep a clear separation between the level of models and the level of their applications, as discussed also in Chap. 1.

It is noteworthy that dynamical systems have been studied using category theory tools in [4], and perhaps these results can be extended to address the model robustness.

This idea is generally aligned with the notion of model robustness introduced in Definition 4.10, but allows the model parameters be distributed probabilistically.

In other words, minimal models are the simplest models capable of describing the specific physical phenomenon of interest. In that regard, identifying the minimal model is one of the tasks of the conceptual modelling phase. The category theory-based modelling framework facilitates this identification due a clear structure of categories of (coupled) mathematical models. Consequently, using minimal models also has potential to reduce computational costs during the instance modelling phase, because more complex models often require more sophisticated algorithms to work with."

This approach is, of course, also a valid way to work with the sets of assumptions and utilise the category theory-based modelling framework. In fact, the framework provides a certain level of flexibility: the modeller can decide which approach best suits their current needs—describe sets of assumptions in a natural language, or consider their formalised versions. At the same time, all possible constructions remain mathematically sound, and there is always a clear way how to switch between the two options."

The difference decreases with increasing wind speeds (thus, increasing \\(V_{r}\\)) for the vertical degree of freedom, as the effect of fluid memory should be insignificant at high \\(V_{r}\\). However, the difference for the rotation for \\(U > 40~\\mathrm{m / s}\\) increases, which is attributed to the effect of fluid memory on the aerodynamic coupling [14]. In [12], further comparison and analysis of models has been performed, which underline that abstract construction defined at the level of categories can be transferred to concrete engineering applications and numerical calculations."

This chapter begins with a presentation of ideas for automatic model generation. The key concept is to analyse the formalisation mappings that appear in categories of mathematical models from a computer science perspective. These ideas naturally lead to the application of type theory to mathematical modelling. In this concept, mathematical models are formalised by types, and the type system of a functional programming language can be utilised to verify the consistency of model derivation. A general algorithm for such verification is presented in this chapter. Finally, a relational algebra-based approach to abstract description of models is proposed. While this approach lacks some strictness of the category theory-based modelling framework, it compensates with enhanced flexibility in working with models and relations between them. Moreover, even models of physical objects, which are not necessary described in terms of mathematical expressions and equations, can also be addressed by this approach."

This revisiting leads naturally to a general discussion on the possibility of the practical implementation of the category theory-based modelling framework. Additionally, we highlight open problems that arise in this context. As a result, this section outlines potential directions for future research."

As it can be clearly observed, this figure represents a kind of blending between the diagrams depicting the structures of the categories \\(\\mathbf{Beam}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{Beam}^{F}\\). Furthermore, in constructing this lattice of mathematical models, we have implicitly adapted the idea of relating models by comparing their sets of assumptions, as described through the concept of complexity in Definition 3.2. In this context, the expansion operation is understood as expanding the range of physical effects and phenomena describable by a model, while the analogy operation is understood as a reformulation of the model formulation \\(C\\) into \\(\\mathcal{D}\\)."

At the same time, these examples reveal that the interpretation of these lattices is purely subjective, as is typically the case for any knowledge representation system. However, it is important to remark, that this subjectivity can be eliminated if all movements along the lattice are clearly defined, as in the classical case of the lattice of theories from [28]. Keeping this idea in mind, let us now examine another example: we will create a lattice of mathematical models associated with the objects of the category Elast."

In general, it is also possible to use expansion operation, for example, between \\(\\mathfrak{M}_{\\mathrm{ME}}\\) and \\(\\mathfrak{M}_{\\mathrm{NE}}\\). However, the interpretation of these expansions is rather not straightforward, because we need at first to discard some axioms from the micropolar theory and then add new axioms from the nonlinear elasticity. Hence, we use the revision operation, as depicted in Fig. 5.4. Evidently, this interpretation is closely aligned with the original concept of the lattice of theories."

Specifically, we have revisited the definition of categories of mathematical models and presented initial concepts aimed at automatic model generation. Along this path, the notion of a consistently formalisable set of assumptions has been proposed. The critical point here is the theoretical existence of a verification algorithm allowing checking the derivation of a model from its underlying set of assumptions. This problem can be seen as analogous to the decidability problem in logic or the decision problem in computer science. Thus, the ideas on automatic model generation open potential directions for future research at the intersection of mathematics and theoretical computer science."

The advantage of using type theory is that many programming languages utilise the idea of composing types. As a result, the type checker of a programming language can be used to verify the model derivation."

Thus, it is necessary to distinguish between conceptual modelling errors, related to breaking basic modelling assumptions, and modelling errors related to practical realisation of models, such as the quality of computer implementation and approximation quality. While the errors related to practical realisation of models are well-understood and studied, the conceptual modelling errors are much more difficult to address, because a deep understanding of the model creation process is required."
