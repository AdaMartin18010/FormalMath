Rather, it is designed as pre-reading or concurrent reading for an Abstract Algebra course. I do mean that it is designed for reading, which is important because students are often unaccustomed to learning mathematics from books, and because research shows that many do not read effectively. This book is therefore less dense and more accessible than typical undergraduate texts. It contains serious discussions of central Abstract Algebra concepts, but these begin where the student is likely to be. They make links to earlier mathematics, refute common misconceptions, and explain how definitions and theorems capture intuitive ideas in mathematically sophisticated ways. The narrative thus unfolds in what I hope is a natural and engaging style, while developing the rigour appropriate for undergraduate study."

Theory is explicitly discussed: Part 1 provides information on the roles of axioms, definitions, theorems and proofs, and Part 2 encourages attention to logical argument. But numerous sections provide examples before inviting generalization, or introduce technical terms informally before they are defined, or observe phenomena to be formalized later. I take this approach with care, highlighting informality and noting where formal versions can be found. But I consider it useful because the central ideas of early Abstract Algebra are so tightly interwoven—really I would like to introduce all of the book's main ideas simultaneously. Obviously that is impossible, but I do want to keep some pace in the narrative, to prioritize concepts and important relationships over technicalities. I realize, of course, that this approach goes against the grain of mathematical presentation and means that this is not a book that a typical course could 'follow'. But I am content with that—the world is full of standard textbooks developing theory from the bottom up, and my aim is to provide an alternative with a focus on conceptual understanding."

I am all for inquiry-based courses, and for any well-thought-out approach that allows students to reinvent mathematical ideas through independent or collaborative problem solving. But the reality is that most mathematics lectures are still just that: lectures. Many lecturers are constrained by class sizes"

More information on the studies we conducted can be found in Alcock, Hodds, Roy and Inglis (2015), an article in the Notices of the American Mathematical Society. The bibliography contains extensive references to decades' worth of research on student learning about specific concepts in Abstract Algebra and about general proof-based mathematics. I encourage interested readers to investigate further."

I don't often get that feeling from algebraic arguments, no matter how sure I am that each step is valid. And Abstract Algebra didn't seem to have many visual representations, so I didn't find much to hold on to. I don't blame my lecturer for this—I failed rather badly to keep up, so I didn't follow his lectures effectively and I probably missed some enlightening explanations.

And where I grew up, adult female neighbours and friends were commonly referred to as 'Auntie', even where there were no family relationships.

This means that they can be big and complex, though that does not necessarily make them hard to think about. A single tree, after all, might have tens of branches and thousands of leaves—it has lots of internal structure, but you can treat it as a single thing. Mathematical objects can be like this too. For instance, the set of all even numbers is infinite and has lots of internal structure, but again you can treat it as a single thing. Such thinking is important in Abstract Algebra: often it is useful to switch between examining an object's internal structure and thinking of it as a unified whole."

Binary operations might be commutative on some sets but not on others. In some sets there are few ways to combine objects to give zero; in others, there are many. Thus, 'facts' that are true for one operation on one set do not necessarily hold elsewhere, and Abstract Algebra requires concentration to ensure that you do not overgeneralize from a familiar context. I won't lie: this is hard. When you are accustomed to 'doing' algebra in numerical contexts, it might not require much effort. The manipulations become natural enough that you do them easily, much as you might walk or type easily. And concentrating on something that you do easily feels weird and disruptive. If you concentrate on your muscles as you walk, you become slow and ungainly. If you can touch-type, but you force yourself to look at the keyboard and think about which letters you want, you might find that you can't type at all. Focusing on why algebraic manipulations are valid can feel similar: slow, clunky and therefore like a step backward in your learning rather than a step forward. It takes discipline, and for a while might feel frustrating."

For now, note that applying this definition requires understanding what a subgroup is, what the notation means, and so on.

This renders the closure question moot for division on \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\), because division is not even a binary operation on \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\). That might strike you as overly fussy, because only one element is problematic: division is defined on nearly all of \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\).

The first is as assumptions, as things that are obviously true so that everyone can agree to use them without justification. For instance, addition on the real numbers is associative, because for every \\( x, y, z \\in \\mathbb{R} \\), \\( (x + y) + z = x + (y + z) \\). This is one of numerous axioms for the real numbers, a list of which might be studied in Analysis.

If you have studied some undergraduate mathematics, you might know that order in these quantifiers is important. The \\(\\exists\\) comes first in the identity axiom because there is a single identity that combines in a certain way with all other elements.

If that seems weird, there is no need to worry—you will understand this book if you think of the integers as familiar and the axioms as assumptions that capture their properties.

First, specific operations often come with notation: \\(^+\\) for addition, \\(^{\\times}\\) or \\(^{\\cdot \\cdot}\\) or juxtaposition for multiplication, \\(^{\\circ}\\) for function composition. Second, Abstract Algebra involves theory building, constructing general proofs that apply to all groups or all rings. For rings, the two operations are closely linked to standard addition and multiplication so they are usually denoted by \\(^+\\) and either \\(^{\\cdot \\cdot}\\) or juxtaposition. For groups, there is more variety, which demands notational decisions. To write about all groups, we want notation that does not mislead us into thinking about specific operations; \\(^{\\star \\star}\\) is good for that. But mathematicians also value brevity, and dislike writing \\(^{\\star \\star}\\) all the time (my handwritten stars always come out wonky, which is annoying). So general statements and arguments tend to be written in multiplicative notation using juxtaposition. With juxtaposition, the group definition looks like this."

I ask not because there is a 'right answer', but to encourage you to reflect on your understanding and improve its accuracy. For instance, when describing equation solving, people often say things like 'change sides, change signs'. But, really, nothing changes sides or signs—each algebraic step does the same thing to both sides. In terms appropriate to Abstract Algebra, we might say that solving an equation involves making deductions that are valid for the relevant sets and operations in order to reveal the solutions. And what is valid is not universal, which will become increasingly clear as you gain experience with groups and rings. For instance, zero divisors like those seen for matrices also exist in modular arithmetic."

To understand a proof, I think it helps first to think about the relevant logic. What does it mean to say that cosets partition a set? It means that every element of the set is in a coset, and that the cosets are disjoint. For \\(12\\mathbb{Z}\\) in \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\), every element of \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) is in a coset because every \\(a \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\) is in \\(a + 12\\mathbb{Z}\\). But how to capture the notion of 'disjoint'? One way is to say that for any two cosets, either the intersection—the overlap—is empty, or the sets are the same. Mathematicians denote the intersection of two sets \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) by \\(X \\cap Y\\) ('\\(X\\) intersect \\(Y\\)) and the empty set by \\(\\emptyset\\). So we want to prove that for any two cosets \\(a + 12\\mathbb{Z}\\) and \\(b + 12\\mathbb{Z}\\), either \\((a + 12\\mathbb{Z}) \\cap (b + 12\\mathbb{Z}) = \\emptyset\\) or \\(a + 12\\mathbb{Z} = b + 12\\mathbb{Z}\\)."

That is pretty abstract, so here is a quick explanation. The set \\( X \\times X \\) is the set of all pairs of the form \\( (x, y) \\) where \\( x, y \\in X \\). The notation \\( (x, y) \\) might call to mind a plane, which is appropriate because if \\( X = \\mathbb{R} \\) then \\( \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R} \\) is indeed 'the plane' in the usual sense. If \\( X = \\mathbb{Z} \\) then \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z} \\) is an infinite grid of points with integer coordinates. If \\( X \\) is finite, then \\( X \\times X \\) is a finite grid. An equivalence relation is a subset of \\( X \\times X \\) because only some elements are related to each other (usually). For instance, for the above equivalence relation on \\( X = \\{a_1, a_2, a_3, b_1, b_2, b_3, c_1, c_2, c_3\\} \\), the grid below has dots at all points \\( (x, y) \\) for which \\( x \\sim y \\).

Each column is a coset; the leftmost is the subgroup \\(3\\mathbb{Z}\\). Looking horizontally, each coset is 'offset' from the subgroup by a fixed number. Looking vertically, the elements within every coset differ from one another by elements of the subgroup (in this case, multiples of 3). Chapter 7 will apply this idea to other groups."

So they have to study their notes after class. This sounds like it should be easy because undergraduates have been reading for perhaps 15 years. But mathematical reading is not like ordinary reading. As discussed in the preceding sections, it requires abnormal attention to logic. Moreover, when practised by experts, it is not linear. Mathematicians do not start at the beginning of a page and read until the end. Rather, they seek links among all the words and symbols, reading back and forth along lines of text, between lines, and between paragraphs. They do this even with mathematics that they do not find challenging, because they understand the importance of the logical relationships."

With that done, it is often possible to work forward from the premises and backward from the conclusion by formulating relevant things in terms of definitions or by making standard or obvious deductions. If you let it, a formal approach will shoulder quite a bit of the burden of proving. Indeed, for simple proofs, it might on its own be enough."

By week eight, you might want to lie on the floor, moan quietly and wish for someone to make it all easy. I can't make it easy—undergraduate mathematics just isn't easy. But if you find Abstract Algebra difficult, that is not because you are stupid or incapable. It's because it is difficult. If this is your first full-on theorems-and-proofs course, it is likely to seem both difficult and alarmingly different from earlier mathematics. This can make students wonder whether they have topped out—whether they cannot cope with mathematics at this level or, more prosaically, whether they just don't like it."

If you wished, you could switch to an easier degree or major, switch to a lower-prestige institution, or drop out of higher education and take a different route into professional life. Some students choose to do those things, and more power to them—everyone should think about how to use their time. But most students don't. Most, when they reflect, decide that although it might be difficult, they do want to stick with their degree. Reflection and recommitment help, though.

Evidence on this comes from research studies like one in which students spent the same amount of time studying formulas for calculating volumes in either interleaved or blocked conditions. During practice, the blockers were considerably more accurate than the interleavers. But during later testing, they had forgotten a large proportion of what they had learned, whereas the interleavers had forgotten almost nothing. It is very important to understand this. Immediate performance is not a good indicator of learning efficacy; good immediate performance does not mean that learning will stick."

Mathematicians are often assigned to teach topics that they haven't studied for years. So they have to relearn them. If your lecturers seem to have lots of information at their fingertips, that is not because they picked it up effortlessly the first time and never forgot it. It is because they have revisited it repeatedly so that their forgetting curves are pretty flat. But they also do retrieval practice voluntarily. Mathematicians who have forgotten things will usually try to reconstruct them before looking them up.

A table cannot show 'all' the results for an infinite set like the integers, but it can visually represent an operation's properties. For instance, in the partial table below we can 'see' that multiplication on the integers is commutative, meaning that for every \\(x, y \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\), \\(xy = yx\\) (see Section 1.2). This is manifest in symmetry about the main diagonal from top left to bottom right.

Commutativity is about the order in which elements appear, and whether this can be changed without changing the result. This difference is captured in the definitions—check that you see how.

If the original sum is written as \\(3 + 6 + 7\\), we might calculate \\((3 + 7) + 6\\), implicitly using commutativity. These tend to feel like intelligent applications of the same reasoning, so it is useful to recognize that associativity and commutativity do not always go together.

We could define a different operation to take the mean of three numbers by finding \\(\\frac{1}{3}(a + b + c)\\). But that would not be a binary operation, and its results would differ from both \\((a * b) * c = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(a + b) + c\\right)\\) and \\(a * (b * c) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(a + \\frac{1}{2}(b + c)\\right)\\). This is important because the expressions \\((s_1 * s_2) * s_3\\) and \\(s_1 * (s_2 * s_3)\\) involve three elements but apply the binary operation to only two at a time. For associative operations, both orders always give the same result, meaning that \\(s_1 * s_2 * s_3\\) (without brackets) is well defined. If an operation is not associative—or if we do not know whether it is or not—we should take care over which of \\((s_1 * s_2) * s_3\\) and \\(s_1 * (s_2 * s_3)\\) we write."

More often in Abstract Algebra we speak about addition or multiplication, then ask whether additive and multiplicative inverses exist. Second, you might have noticed that I have discussed how closure, identities, inverses and commutativity are reflected in binary operation tables. I have not done the same for associativity. Why is that, do you think? There are two reasons. One is that associativity is about triples of elements in expressions like \\((s_1*s_2)*s_3\\). A table cannot represent these because it is only two-dimensional—how could a hypothetical three-dimensional 'table' be used to check whether \\((s_1*s_2)*s_3 = s_1*(s_2*s_3)\\)? The other reason is that associativity is typically either axiomatically assumed or inherited from a structure in which it is axiomatically assumed. For instance, associativity for addition modulo 12 requires that"

Rotations and reflections are isometries of the plane, where an isometry is a distance-preserving transformation. Distance-preserving means what it sounds like it means: if any two points \\((x_{1},y_{1})\\) and \\((x_{2},y_{2})\\) are distance \\(d\\) apart before the transformation, they are distance \\(d\\) apart after.

Section 5.1 observed that a binary operation on a set \\( S \\) is formally defined as a function on \\( S \\times S \\). What exactly does that mean? It is not about binary operations on functions, which take two functions and add or compose them. Rather, it is about binary operations as function, on \\( S \\times S \\). The notation \\( S \\times S \\) means the set of all pairs \\( (s_1, s_2) \\) where \\( s_1, s_2 \\in S \\); a function on \\( S \\times S \\) assigns an output to every such pair. For instance, a binary operation on \\( S = \\mathbb{R} \\) is a function on \\( \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R} \\), where \\( \\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R} \\) is often denoted by \\( \\mathbb{R}^2 \\). For some readers, functions on \\( \\mathbb{R}^2 \\) will be familiar from multivariable calculus. For instance, the function \\( f: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R} \\) given by \\( f(x, y) = x^2 - y^2 \\) is graphed below: each point \\( (x, y) \\) in the 'input' plane has an 'output' \\( z = f(x, y) \\) at height \\( x^2 - y^2 \\)."

And, technically, this has to be the case: for a binary operation \\( *: S \\times S \\to S \\), the output must be in \\( S \\). But we have also considered cases in which a set is not closed under a binary operation: \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\backslash \\{0\\} \\) is not closed under division, for instance. This does not prevent us talking about division on \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\backslash \\{0\\} \\): we could consider division to be a partial function on \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z} \\) or—as noted in Section 2.2—we could consider division as a binary operation on \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\backslash \\{0\\} \\) and note that \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\backslash \\{0\\} \\) as a subset of \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\backslash \\{0\\} \\) is not closed under division.

In some situations, one or the other might sound more natural—a group of friends, a set of cutlery—but the meaning is usually a collection of things that go together. In mathematics, this is not the case: the words group and set have different mathematical meanings. A mathematical set is simply a collection of objects. These objects might have something in common, but that is not necessary—a set need not have special properties. A mathematical group, on the other hand, does have special properties. A group \\((G,*)\\) is a set \\(G\\) with a binary operation \\(*\\) that satisfies four\\(^1\\) axioms as in the definition below (first discussed in Sections 1.3 and 2.3).

Fortunately, associativity is defined using the single universal quantifier for all, so every subset of every group inherits associativity from the group (see Section 3.5). This reasoning means that associativity is never a problem for subgroups. And it is often easy to check whether a possible subgroup contains the identity. Inverses and closure might require more thought, though. With that in mind, can you identify other subgroups of \\( D_3 \\)? Can you find them all? Try this before moving on as it will help you to get a feel for the structure of this group and for how subgroups work in general. Section 6.7 will examine dihedral groups in more detail, and Section 6.10 will consider conditions guaranteeing that a subset of a group is a subgroup."

But could reordering the elements reveal hidden stripes? One way to answer is to consider group properties. Every cyclic group is commutative. And \\( D_{3} \\) is not: for instance, \\( \\rho r_{1} \\neq r_{1}\\rho \\). Reordering cannot make non-commutativity 'go away' because it does not change the result of any composition.

If you thought about possible subgroup orders in Sections 3.5 or 6.2, you might know or intuit that in a finite group, the order of a subgroup must divide the order of the group (more on that in Section 7.7). So four elements is too many for a proper subgroup of a six-element group, and it must be that \\( \\langle r_1,r_2\\rangle = D_3 \\). Do two distinct reflections always generate \\( D_{3} \\), or is \\( \\langle r_1,r_2\\rangle \\) special?

Composition is associative because permutations are functions. The identity permutation leaves every element where it is (we might just write 'e' in tuple notation). And every permutation has an inverse sending each element back to where it came from. The group of all permutations of a set with \\( n \\) elements is denoted by \\( S_{n} \\). Its elements are usually written with numbers as above, assuming that \\( S = \\{1,2,3,\\dots,n\\} \\). The group \\( S_{n} \\) is called the symmetric group of degree \\( n \\). Note: symmetric group, not symmetry group. That name is different enough to be annoying if symmetric groups and symmetry groups are the same, and similar enough to be annoying if they are different. To work out which it is, we will look at specific symmetric groups, starting small."

This way of identifying subgroups generalizes to any property that interacts similarly favourably with the group axioms. One such property is fixing elements or sets of elements. For instance, consider the subset of \\( S_4 \\) containing all permutations that fix the number 1. Composing two such permutations gives another, associativity is inherited, the identity fixes 1, and every permutation that fixes 1 has an inverse that fixes 1. This subset is therefore a subgroup; it comprises all permutations that permute the three numbers 2, 3 and 4 so it is isomorphic to \\( D_3 \\)."

What subgroups are generated by individual elements of \\( S_4 \\)? How about by pairs or triples of elements? Which combinations generate the whole of \\( S_4 \\)? Investigate and you will find that for a group of this size, this is a complex question. It is therefore useful to have systematic ways to think about relationships between permutations, and one way to do this is to consider transpositions. A transposition is a two-element permutation like (12), and transpositions combine in useful ways to generate other permutations.

When coset definitions are introduced, you will likely be asked to calculate cosets for specific subgroups of specific groups. This is not very interesting as it just involves calculating lists. It is worth doing, to develop your sense of how cosets are formed, and to understand that in \\( aH \\) or \\( a + H \\), the element \\( a \\) can be any element of the group, not only—as muddled students sometimes think—elements of the subgroup \\( H \\) (what happens if \\( a \\in H \\))? But do not make the mistake of thinking page-filling calculations important. What is important and interesting about cosets is their role as elements of quotient groups. By all means calculate attentively, but then make some effort to think of the resulting cosets as single entities. This compression is important."

I do not know the history but I find this an appealingly snooty use of language, implying that it is normal for a subgroup to give rise to a quotient group and that subgroups that do not are inferior. They are not inferior, of course—any set that meets the definition of a subgroup is a subgroup. But normal subgroups do have extra properties.

First, (left) cosets leave nothing out because for every group \\( G \\), every subgroup \\( H \\) contains the identity \\( e \\). So, for every element \\( a \\in G \\), the element \\( a = ae \\) is in the coset \\( aH \\).

Happily, everything does work: normality is both necessary and sufficient for a subgroup to give rise to a quotient group. This can be established in part by generalizing a theorem and proof from Section 3.3, which showed that addition for cosets of \\( 12\\mathbb{Z} \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) is well defined—that the natural operation on cosets respects the results of operating on elements. The general version below shows that the natural operation on cosets of a normal subgroup is always well defined—that, for cosets of a normal subgroup (written in multiplicative notation), it is always meaningful to write \\( (aH)(bH) = (ab)H \\). As you read the proof, notice that \\( bH = Hb \\) does not imply that \\( h_1b = bh_1 \\), which might be a tempting inference. Because \\( H \\) is a set, it implies only that there is a possibly different element \\( h_3 \\in H \\) such that \\( h_1b = bh_3 \\). Where would the proof break down if a subgroup were not normal?"

Associativity requires that for any three cosets \\(aH\\), \\(bH\\) and \\(cH\\), \\(((aH)(bH))cH = aH((bH)(cH))\\). How would you show that this equality holds? The identity coset will be \\(H\\) or, if you prefer, \\(eH\\). Why is \\(eH\\) equal to \\(H\\), and why is it true that for every coset \\(aH\\), \\((eH)(aH) = (aH)(eH) = aH\\)? Finally, which coset do you think will act as the inverse of \\(aH\\)? This is not a trick question—you can check that the obvious choice works. In your course, look out for a formally written proof that captures the ideas in this paragraph; this establishes that normality of \\(H\\) in \\(G\\) is sufficient for \\(G / H\\) to be a quotient group."

Each column is a coset; the leftmost is the subgroup \\( 3\\mathbb{Z} \\). Within each coset, elements differ from one another by elements of the subgroup.

Remember that in a group table, every element appears once in each row and column (see Section 5.3). So, if the top left quadrant of the table contains subgroup elements, the top right and bottom left quadrants must contain non-subgroup elements. What does that leave for the bottom right quadrant? The subgroup elements again. Thus the table must be arranged in a \\(2 \\times 2\\) checkerboard pattern of subgroup and non-subgroup elements, giving a quotient group isomorphic to \\(\\mathbb{Z}_2\\). In \\(\\mathbb{Z}_{12}\\), for instance, the subgroup \\((\\{0,2,4,6,8,10\\}, +_{12})\\) must be normal. In \\(D_3\\), the subgroup \\(\\{e,\\rho,\\rho^2\\}\\) must be normal. In \\(D_4\\), every four-element subgroup must be normal--you might like to pick one from the diagram in Section 7.3 and draw a table in which its elements appear together in the top left. As you do that, notice that every four-element subgroup contains the group's centre. Why is that?"

Also, the identity alone is always a subgroup, and must be normal because for every \\( a \\in G \\), \\( a\\{e\\} = ae = a = ea = \\{e\\}a \\). So every group has at least two normal subgroups. Second, students who have studied some Abstract Algebra might know that normal subgroups occur as kernels of group homomorphisms. If you already knew that, you might want to think about why. Either way, you can find more in Chapter 8."

The dihedral group \\(D_{4}\\) has subgroups of orders \\(1,2,4\\) and 8. The smallest group to provide a"

And working with small groups might make isomorphisms seem trivial. For instance, cyclic groups can be understood as points evenly spaced around a circle, so it is not surprising that they match other groups with that feature (see Section 6.6)."

I learned while writing this book that the group of rotations of a cube is isomorphic to \\( S_4 \\), the set of permutations of \\( \\{1,2,3,4\\} \\) under composition (see Section 6.9). Does that seem plausible? Is it obvious? For me, plausibility is fine. The group \\( S_4 \\) has \\( 4! = 24 \\) elements, and cubes have 6 faces, 8 vertices and 12 edges—all of those numbers 'go with' 24. But it is not obvious, so I can try to count. There is the identity rotation, obviously, plus three non-identity rotations about each of three distinct face-centred axes. That is ten so far. Then there is one rotation through each of the six axes joining the midpoints of opposite edges. That takes us to 16. Finally, there are two non-identity rotations about each of the four diagonals that join opposite vertices. That gives 24 in total."

For instance, the homomorphism \\( \\phi : \\mathbb{Z}_6 \\to \\mathbb{Z}_6 \\) with \\( \\phi(1) = 3 \\) has kernel \\( \\{0,2,4\\} \\); the homomorphism \\( \\phi : (\\mathbb{R}, +) \\to (U, \\times) \\) given by \\( \\phi(x) = e^{2\\pi ix} \\) has kernel \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\). For others, the kernel contains only one element: the homomorphism \\( \\phi : (\\mathbb{Z}, +) \\to (\\mathbb{Q}, +) \\) with \\( \\phi(1) = 2 \\) has kernel \\( \\{0\\} \\). Note that \\( \\{0\\} \\) is the set containing the element zero, not just the number 0—you could probably get away with writing 'ker \\( \\phi = 0 \\)', but mathematicians notice this kind of technical inaccuracy. Note also that this third homomorphism, with only the identity in its kernel, is injective (where the others are not). This is not a coincidence, and the general result is captured below. As usual, remember the self-explanation training from Section 3.6. Can you justify each deduction in this proof with definitional properties or theorems about homomorphisms?"

A general ring is often denoted \\((R, +, \\cdot)\\) or \\((R, +, \\times)\\) or just \\(R\\). You can replace \\(R\\) with \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) in each axiom below to check that \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) satisfies the definition of a ring under standard addition and multiplication. Note that the list requires a ring to have a multiplicative identity, which is no problem for \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\). But, as noted in Section 2.4, it is possible to define rings without this axiom then call a ring with a multiplicative identity a ring with unity or ring with one. Here, observe that the notation 'R' is obviously sensible, but can lead to errors for people accustomed to writing 'R' for the real numbers.

Just as writing \\((\\mathbb{Z}, +)\\) emphasizes the additive group structure of the integers, writing \\((\\mathbb{Z}, +, \\cdot)\\) or \\((\\mathbb{Z}, +, \\times)\\) emphasizes their two-operation ring structure. A course might not use that notation, though. As elsewhere in mathematics, multiplication is commonly denoted by juxtaposition, using \\((ab)c = a(bc)\\) rather than \\((a \\cdot b) \\cdot c = a \\cdot (b \\cdot c)\\) or \\((a \\times b) \\times c = a \\times (b \\times c)\\). This merits attention if you have previously studied group theory. Each group has just one operation, so group theoretic claims are often written using juxtaposition regardless of whether the operation is multiplication or addition or composition or something else. Each ring has two operations, which need to be distinguished. So, although ring multiplication might be denoted in different ways, addition is usually denoted explicitly by \\(^\\circ +\\) This will be important in Section 9.7."

A ring can have those extra properties—for instance, \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) has commutative multiplication. But it doesn't have to—\\(\\mathbb{Z}\\) does not have multiplicative inverses (with exceptions for which two"

For instance, for left distributivity, the remainder of \\(a(b + c)\\) on division by \\(n\\) is always the same as the remainder of \\(ab + ac\\) on division by \\(n\\). Why? How do such properties in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_n\\) rely indirectly on properties in \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\)?"

Proving that they do is not that difficult but also not that interesting, partly because there are so many axioms. Your course might offer a full proof; here I will illustrate with two."

But virtually all textbooks contain good explanations in their expository sections. These become more important in undergraduate study, where you are unlikely to understand everything in lectures: a slightly different explanation might make the links you need. That makes it worth investing an hour or two in finding a book that you find helpful. I recommend going to your university's library and assembling five or six Abstract Algebra books. Find those recommended by your lecturer, then scan the shelves for any of which there are multiple copies—someone, at some point, thought these worth ordering. Then, in each book, find the beginning of the same topic—groups, say—and read the first couple of pages. This will reveal big differences in expository style: some books are terse and others are wordy, some have many examples and others have few, and so on. Some you will immediately dislike. But one or two you will find useful, perhaps in different ways. Those are the ones to borrow or buy, and to study regularly."

So you have to work out how to learn effectively from whatever is happening in the room. One specific problem is that lecture notes often contain only the bare-bones axioms, definitions, theorems and proofs. Much of the useful information is in what the lecturer says but does not write down. Lecturers explain the thinking that links one line of a proof to another, refer back to earlier ideas, and so on. Recording this information might be difficult: in some lectures, students can barely keep up. But often that is not the case. Many lecturers provide notes or lecture recordings online, which frees you up to make choices about whether to try to write everything, or to pre-print notes and annotate them, or to make minimal notes and rewatch difficult sections later. Certainly your notes do not have to look the same as everyone else's. If you take down whatever seems useful for your thinking, you are putting in self-explanations as you go."

In those circumstances, people often try to speed up, glossing over things that they don't really understand in order to 'catch up'. But usually they need to do the opposite. Patchy understanding isn't much use in a subject like Abstract Algebra, and you will often make more progress in a given week if you first sort out your understanding of its most important ideas. And that means you do need to be studying each week. As discussed in Chapter 1, Abstract Algebra is very hierarchical. This makes it particularly unforgiving of poor study habits: students who do not study consistently can soon find that it makes no sense at all. To avoid that situation, I recommend reviewing Chapter 4."

Is the specific object important in its context, in the sense that it has special properties? Or is it an arbitrary member of a group or ring? If a symbol denotes a set, is that set unstructured, or is it a group or a ring? Is it treated as a subset or subgroup or subring of another set,"

This should facilitate self-explanation, as described in Section 3.6. It should also facilitate proof construction; Section 3.7 provided some thoughts on that but, if you read it before Part 2, you now know much more about a range of concepts, so it would be worth revisiting. It is then worth thinking about why a meaningful understanding provides a strong base for constructing proofs and for doing well in Abstract Algebra. I would list three reasons. First, when trying to prove something, you will often have access to a lot of possibly useful axioms, definitions and earlier theorems; deciding which to use is much easier with clear understanding of what each one says. Second, the theorems of Abstract Algebra are all expressed in similar notation; students who do not really understand them can easily muddle them up. Third, it is difficult to remember things that are not meaningfully understood. I certainly would not want to attempt an Abstract Algebra exam based on brute-force memorization. I am sure it can be done, but I have long thought that students who get the top marks probably work on average less hard than those who get slightly lower marks, because they are doing a different and, in the long run, slightly easier task. Acquiring meaningful understanding requires a lot of up-front effort, but meaningful understanding sticks."
