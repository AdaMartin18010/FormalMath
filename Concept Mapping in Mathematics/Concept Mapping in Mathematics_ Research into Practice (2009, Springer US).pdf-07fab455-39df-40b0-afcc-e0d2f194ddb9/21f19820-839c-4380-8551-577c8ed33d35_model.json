I believe the authors succeed in showing that mathematics can be more than the memorization of procedures to get answers to textbook types of problems. Through all of my elementary and high school studies of mathematics, I thought that what was required was to learn the procedures for getting answers, and I recall thinking that after doing 2 or 3 textbook problems of a given type, mathematics was rather tedious and relatively boring. By contrast, I saw the study of science as the search for understanding of fundamental concepts, such as the nature of matter, energy, and evolution. This I found to be exciting and I was always eager to seek deeper understanding of basic science concepts. It came as a somewhat shocking surprise to me when I was studying calculus at the University of Minnesota that there were fundamental mathematics concepts also, such as limit, slope, proportionality, etc. I recall feeling cheated that none of my teachers had helped me to gain a conceptual understanding of mathematics!"

With the invention of the concept mapping tool, it became clear to me why the latter was the case in some disciplines. To achieve relative mastery in a field of science, there were many concepts that had to be learned and understood. In contrast, in music or mathematics, if one gains an early understanding of a few dozen fundamental concepts, such as those discussed in the chapters of this book, you can move on to understanding of major domains of mathematics, and perhaps even do some creative mathematics. History has shown this to be the case. Of course, we are all familiar with the musical early genius of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. My hypothesis is that if we can transform the teaching of mathematics to a field that is conceptually transparent to students from pre-school through high school, this might become one of the easiest fields of study instead of the opaque and often-dreaded study mathematics has been for so many students."

The book consists of a collection of articles on research conducted critically to examine the usefulness of concept maps in the educational setting ranging from primary grade classrooms through secondary mathematics to preservice teacher education, undergraduate mathematics and post-graduate mathematics education. A second meta-cognitive tool, called vee diagrams, was also critically examined by some authors particularly its value in improving mathematical problem solving and mathematical modeling in physics."

We found that Ausubel's assimilation theory of learning presented in his *Psychology of Meaningful Verbal Learning* (1963) spoke to what we were most interested in, namely, how do learners grasp the meanings of concepts in a way that permits them to use these concepts to facilitate future learning and creative problem solving? Ausubel stressed the distinction between learning by rote and learning meaningfully. Rote learning or memorizing information may permit short-term recall of this information, but since it does not involve the learner in actively integrating new knowledge with concepts and propositions already known, it does not lead to an improved organization of knowledge in the learner's cognitive structure. In contrast, meaningful learning requires that the learner chooses actively to seek integration of new concept and propositional meanings into her/his cognitive structure, thereby enhancing and enriching her/his cognitive structure. Since the 1960s, many studies have shown that what distinguishes the naive or novice learner from the expert is the extent to which the person has a highly organized cognitive structure and metacognitive strategies to employ this knowledge in new learning or novel problems solving (Bransford, Brown, & Cocking, 1999). In short, one builds expertise in any discipline by building powerful knowledge structures that characterize the key intellectual achievements in that discipline, as well as strategies to use this knowledge."

Kuhn's (1962) book, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions marked a turning point toward constructivist ideas that saw knowledge creation as a human endeavor that involved changing methodologies and paradigms and an evolving set of ideas and methodologies leading to useful but evolving paradigms and ideas. We saw that this constructivist epistemology and cognitive psychology was equally applicable to mathematics and mathematics teaching. The challenge was: \"how do we get educators and the school contexts to change to enhance the utilization of these new insights\" (Novak, 1986, p. 184). As we proceeded in our mathematics education studies, we found we could work with a theory of learning that explained how new concepts are acquired and used that complemented a theory of knowledge that focused on the evolving creation of new concepts and problem solving approaches."

Earlier studies had shown that a variety of paper and pencil tests were inadequate for monitoring the growth in the children's understanding of concept meanings, so we used interviews to probe the children's knowledge. This, however created another problem in that it was difficult to see in the interview transcripts just how the children's cognitive structure was changing and how new concepts were being integrated into the child's cognitive structure. After struggling with the problem for some weeks, Novak's research group came up with the idea of transforming the interview transcripts into a hierarchically arranged picture showing the concepts and proposition revealed in the interview. We called the resulting drawing a concept map. We found that we could now see explicitly what concept and propositions were being integrated into a child's mind as they progressed through the audio-tutorial lessons, and also in later years as they encountered school science studies."

This led Novak to develop a course called \"Learning To Learn\", and he taught this course at Cornell for some 20 years. One of the outcomes from the course was the book Learning How to Learn (Novak & Gowin, 1984). The book has been published in 9 languages and remains as popular as when it was first published. Concept maps are also powerful metacognitive tools helping students to understand the nature of knowledge and the nature of meaningful learning (Novak, 1990). More recently we have found concept maps to be an excellent tool for capturing expert knowledge for archiving and training in schools and corporations, and also for team problem solving. Beginning some 10 years ago, the Institute for Human and Machine Cognition has developed CmapTools, software that not only facilitates building concept maps but also offers new opportunities for learning, creating, and using knowledge, as will be discussed further."

He found that the use of concept maps could help teachers design a better sequence of topics and helped students see relationships between topics. Minemier (1983) found that when students made concept maps for the topics they studied they not only performed better on problems solving tests but they also gained increased confidence in their ability to do mathematics. Fuata'i (1985, 1998) used concept maps along with vee diagrams with Form Five students in Western Samoa. She found that students became more autonomous learners and better at solving novel problems as compared with students not using these tools. Figure 1.3 shows an example of a concept map produced by one of her students."

CmapTools facilitates the linking of digital resources (e.g. images, videos, text, Web pages, or other digital concept maps) to further explain concepts through a simple drag-and-drop operation. The linked resources are depicted by an icon under the concept that represents the type of resource linked. By storing the concept maps and linked resources on a CmapServer (Cañas, Hill, Granados, C. Pérez, & J. D. Pérez, 2003), the concept maps are converted to Web pages and can be browsed through a Web browser. The search feature in CmapTools takes advantage of the context provided by a concept map to perform Web searches related to the map, producing more relevant results that may include Web pages and resources, or concept maps stored in the CmapTools network (Carvalho, Hewett, & Cañas, 2001). Thus, a small initial map can be used to search for relevant information which the student can investigate, which leads to an improved map, to another search, and so on. The student can link relevant resources found to the map, create other related maps, and organize these into what we call a knowledge model (Cañas, Hill, & Lott, 2003). Figure 1.4 illustrates a concept map made with CmapTools and the insets show some of the resources attached to this map that can be opened by clicking on the icon for the resource. Other examples will be given in subsequent chapters of this book."

By providing a concept map prepared by an expert with 10-15 concepts on a given topic, this \"skeleton\" concept map can help the learner get started by providing a \"scaffold\" for building a more elaborate concept map. Vygotsky (1934), Berk and Winsler (1995) and others point out that the apprentice learner is often very insecure in their knowledge and needs both cognitive and affective encouragement. While the teacher can best provide the latter, the skeleton concept map can provide the cognitive encouragement to get on with the learning task. Moreover, students (and often teachers) may have misconceptions or faulty ideas about a topic that would impede their learning if they were to begin with a \"blank sheet\". The scaffolding provided by the expert map can get the learner off to a good start, and as they begin to research relevant resources and to add concepts and resources to their map, there is a good chance that their misconceptions will also be remediated (Novak, 2002). Figure 1.5 shows an example of an expert skeleton concept map."

Through the drag-and-drop feature of CmapTools that allows for linking supplemental resources to a concept map by simply dragging and dropping the icon for an URL, an image, video, another concept map or any other digital resource on a concept, a learner can build an increasingly complex knowledge model for any domain of knowledge, which can serve as a starting point for later related learning. Moreover, CmapTools provide for easy collaboration between learners either locally or remotely, and either synchronously or asynchronously. When the recorder option of CmapTools is turned on, it will record step-by-step the history of the creation of a concept map, indicating the sequence of building steps and who did what at each step."

This has led to teachers and principals also building concept maps about their schools, communities and a variety of related exchanges (Sánchez et al., 2008). This personal engagement has had strong motivating effects for pursuing other collaborations and we expect this will increase over time as the social network grows.

However, many teachers want to know how they can evaluate knowledge models. In our own teaching, we have used a variety of strategies including having teams post their knowledge models anonymously and then asking students to rank the models from lowest to highest, including criteria for their rankings. Using digital knowledge models created with CmapTools, these can be posted on the class server and provide easy access for assessment. Students can be very insightful, and often brutally honest, in their assessments. Furthermore, serious assessment is an educational experience, and students learn how they can improve their own knowledge models."

Although the research to date supports the value of concept mapping to facilitate meaningful learning (Coffey et al., 2003), very little research has been done in the field of mathematics education. It is our hope this book will encourage such research. We also hope to see studies in mathematics learning that will utilize what we call a New Model for Education, and that libraries of \"expert skeleton concept maps\" in mathematics will be posted on web sites. We observed an increase in the number of papers dealing with mathematics education presented at international conferences on concept mapping from 2004 to 2008 (Cañas, Novak, et al., 2004; Cañas & Novak, 2006; Cañas et al., 2008) and we are hopeful that even more and improved studies will be presented at following conferences (see http://cmc.ihmc.us)."

The student teacher's individually constructed concept maps of the sub-topics length, volume and capacity are presented here including some vee diagrams of related problems. Through concept mapping and vee diagramming, the student teacher's understanding of the mapped topics evolved and deepened, empowering her to confidently provide mathematical justifications for strategies and procedures used in solving problems which are appropriate to the primary level, effectively communicate her understanding publicly, and developmentally sequence learning activities to ensure future students' conceptual understanding of the sub-topics."

Therefore, the focus question for this chapter is: \"In what ways do hierarchical concept maps and vee diagrams facilitate the preparation of primary student teachers for teaching mathematics, in particular, the development of a deep understanding of the content of the relevant syllabus?\" This chapter presents the case study of a Bachelor of Education (Primary) student teacher (i.e., Susan) who concept mapped and vee diagrammed over a semester, in her third year mathematics education course in a regional Australian university."

Linking new concepts to existing cognitive structures may occur via progressive differentiation (reorganization of existing knowledge under more general ideas) and/or integrative reconciliation (synthesising many ideas into one or two when apparent contradictory ideas are reconciled) (Ausubel, 2000; Novak & Canas, 2006). By constructing maps/diagrams, students illustrate publicly their interpretation and understanding of topics/problems. Hierarchical concept maps were first introduced by Novak as a research tool to illustrate the hierarchical interconnections between main concepts (nodes) in a knowledge domain with descriptions of the interrelationships (linking words) on the connecting lines. The basic semantic unit (proposition) describes a meaningful relationship as shown by the triad \"valid node - valid linking words-> valid nodes\" (Novak & Canas, 2006; Novak & Gowin, 1984). Vee diagrams, in contrast, were introduced by Gowin as an epistemological tool, in the shape of a vee that is contextualised in the phenomenon to be analysed. The vee's left side depicts the philosophy and theoretical framework, which drive the analysis to answer the focus question. On the vee's right side are the records, methods of transforming the records to answer the focus question and value claims. The epistemological vee was later modified (Afamasaga-Fuata'i, 1998, 2005) to one that is focused on guiding the thinking and reasoning involved in solving a mathematics problem (examples are presented later)."

Investigations of the usefulness of maps/diagrams to illustrate university students' evolving understanding of mathematics topics found students' mapped knowledge structure became increasingly complex and integrated as a consequence of multiple iterations of the processes of presentation \\(\\rightarrow\\) critique \\(\\rightarrow\\) revisions \\(\\rightarrow\\) presentation over the semester (Afamasaga-Fuata'i, 2007a, 2004). Others also demonstrated the value of maps as pedagogical planning tools to provide an overview of a topic (Brahier, 2005; Afamasaga-Fuata'i, 2006; Afamasaga-Fuata'i & Reading, 2007) or to analyse mathematics lessons (Liyanage & Thomas, 2002). Research also demonstrated the usefulness of diagrams to scaffold students' thinking and reasoning and to illustrate their understanding of the interconnections between theory and application in mathematics problem solving (Afamasaga-Fuata'i, 2007b, 2005), scientific inquiry (Mintzes et al., 2000) and epistemological analysis (Novak & Gowin, 1984; Chang, 1994). In summary, the review of the literature shows three uses of maps/diagrams that are particularly relevant to teacher education. Firstly, maps/diagrams as learning tools to illustrate students' evolving knowledge and understanding of the conceptual structure of a domain; secondly, as analytical tools to scaffold the conceptual analysis of topics or problems; and thirdly, as pedagogical tools to organize and sequence teaching and learning activities using the results of the conceptual analyses of syllabus outcomes."

The main project for the course required Susan to construct a comprehensive, hierarchical concept map of a mathematics topic to be selected from the primary mathematics syllabus, and diagrams of related problems, which demonstrate the applications of the mapped concepts. There were three phases to the project. The first phase (Assignment 1) required that Susan compiled an initial list of concepts, based on a conceptual analysis of the relevant syllabus outcomes, and then to construct an initial topic concept map and diagrams of problems. These were presented and critiqued in class before returning for further revision and expansion. The second phase (Assignment 2) involved the presentation of a more structurally complex, expanded concept map and diagrams of more problems. These were socially critiqued and returned for further revision and expansion. The third phase (Assignment 3) was the final submission of a more comprehensive, hierarchical topic concept map and more diagrams of related problems and activities, which extended previous work and incorporating comments from previous critiques, and including a journal of reflections of concept mapping and vee diagramming experiences."

For example, Fig. 2.8a included a statement and the methodological phrase \"... subtract from 3 m\"; the latter would be more appropriate on the right side under \"How do I find my answers?\" while the corresponding entry for Fig. 2.9 needs to be phrased as a question to be answered not a statement and without the methodological pointers. The latter would be more suitable under methods. As a result of feedback to Susan, this concern was appropriately addressed by the third assignment as evident by the entries \"What is the length of the pencil, desk and book? Which is shortest?\" and \"What is the volume of a rectangular prism with dimensions \\(12\\mathrm{m}\\times 6\\mathrm{m}\\times 4\\mathrm{m}\\) ?\" respectively, in Figs. 2.8b and 2.10."

The inclusion of cross references to the listed principles on the right side in Figs. 2.8b and 2.10 made it easier to explicitly identify the principle that represented the conceptual basis of a main step. For example, in Fig. 2.8b, mathematical justifications for Method 1 are the principles 1 (P1), 2 (P2), and 4 (P4) while principle 5 (P5) is the underlying conceptual basis for Method 2. Similarly for Fig. 2.10, Susan referenced principle (v) (i.e., pv) as the mathematical justification for Line 1 of Method 1 while principles (ii) and (iv) (i.e., pii and piv) underpinned Line 2 of Method 1. The most significant similarity between all four vee diagrams is the depth of conceptual details evident in the entries for What do I know already?. For example, Susan's responses for all four vee diagrams reflected the depth and richness of her interpretations and conceptual analyses of the relevant syllabus outcomes and as concept mapped in Figs. 2.1 to 2.7. The listed principles represented Susan's mathematical justifications for the multiple methods on the right hand side.

Rather than the year twelve (end of secondary level) style that she \"was used to, of formulas are everything\", she perceived the need to approach primary mathematics from a primary perspective. In so doing, she felt she \"was taking a major risk in that (she) was approaching something that would take apart all (her) previously attained ideas and approaches.\" Organised around four themes, namely, (1) critical ability to analyse syllabus topics and problems, (2) solve mathematics problems, (3) communicate effectively, and (4) develop a deep conceptual understanding of the sub-strands, are Susan's reflections presented below."

For example, because she had individually constructed the maps/diagrams, she was in a better and stronger position to explain and justify her ideas publicly due to the critical process she undertook in constructing and completing a concept map or a vee diagram. At the conclusion of the concept mapping and vee diagramming activities, Susan realised that she was able to \"see the connections that infiltrated the topic\", consequently gaining a better understanding of sequencing learning activities. For example, \"(she) now understands what needs to be taught first and where (she) needs to go from there\" through the connections that she made visible on maps and diagrams. Furthermore, over time, completing the thinking side of vee diagrams eventually became much easier and done as efficiently as she did the right hand side. At times, she challenged herself by using the thinking side first to guide the development of her methods, which was something she did not use to do before. This was a significant development in her critical approach to problem solving. In her journal, she recorded that the principles guided her development of appropriate solutions, and sometimes, if the method is done first, she could flexibly use the solutions to infer what the principles should be. Over time, Susan became increasingly confident in critically using her concept map to identify subsequent learning and the next developmentally appropriate strategy or method guided by the propositions on the concept maps."

The concept maps on the other hand, visually illustrated the recommended strategies to be promoted in primary mathematics, as well as making explicit visual connections between length, volume, capacity and surface area.

This suggests the potential educational value of regularly exposing primary students to the strategies of concept mapping and vee diagramming to enhance and develop both their conceptual and methodological understanding of mathematics. Doing so would necessarily enable working and communicating mathematically amongst students in the classroom. Having students regularly construct their own maps and diagrams before and after a topic, as part of their normal mathematics classroom practices can lead to a more integrated and interconnected understanding of mathematics concepts and strategies as well as the development of critical thinking and reasoning."

Collectively the impact engenders a better appreciation of how the main concepts and recommended strategies are developmentally progressed within each sub-strand, and how its mathematical principles are applied in methods as demonstrated by the sample data presented. These findings imply that concept maps and vee diagrams are potentially useful tools for learning mathematics and solving problems more meaningfully and more conceptually. The classroom applications of these tools are worthy of further investigation."

However, current elementary mathematics curricula fail to adequately develop the concept of positional system, attempting instead to teach operations in base ten in isolation. This paper exhibits the power of concept mapping to reveal to teachers the centrality of this concept in elementary mathematics. The map presented here, constructed by Maryanne, a pre-service teacher, also features the pedagogical content knowledge required to successfully teach the concept of positional system and the other mathematics concepts to which it is related. Maryanne's pedagogical treatment is neither simplistic nor reductionist, but reveals the conceptual essence of the concepts in question and the complexity of their relationships within elementary mathematics when taught as a conceptual system."

Unfortunately, its former prominence in the elementary mathematics curriculum has yet to be restored. It is not included in the current reform effort of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM, 1989, 2000), and is absent from most elementary school mathematics and elementary mathematics methods textbooks as well (cf. Burris, 2005, for a notable exception). The multi-base blocks invented by Zoltan Dienes some fifty years ago have virtually disappeared not only from US classrooms but from the catalogs of suppliers of mathematics manipulatives as well (the Prairie Rainbow Blocks developed by George Gagnon constitute a rare exception).

Ken's progressive maps/diagrams illustrated how his pedagogical understanding of fractions evolved over the semester as a consequence of social critiques and further revision. Progressive vee diagrams also illustrated his growing confidence to justify methods of solutions in terms of mathematical principles underlying the main steps."

Further, teachers should have the capacity to diagnose instances of significant learning and, when it is not occurring, to provide appropriate support to assist students along their developmental learning trajectories (e.g., AAMT, 2007; NCTM, 2007). This requires that we are, not only familiar with the psychology and epistemology of learning to empower us to appropriately assist individuals coming to know, understand and learn new ideas meaningfully, but that we are also familiar with the range of socio-cultural factors that impact on learning in a social milieu so that we can support students'"

SMK is further defined as consisting of substantive knowledge (i.e., knowledge of principles and concepts of the discipline) and syntactic knowledge (i.e., knowledge of the discipline's methods of generating and validating knowledge) (Shulman, 1986). While knowledge has the properties of a commodity – that is, it is categorical, codifiable, and can be traded or exchanged (Lyotard, 1979, as cited in Feldman (1996)), understanding is the result of meaning-making in situations (Brunner, 1990) and requires that students actively organize knowledge hierarchically to show interconnections between relevant concepts, with the most general and most inclusive concepts superordinate to less general and most specific concepts (Ausubel, 2000; Novak & Gowin, 1984; Novak, 2002). That the conceptual interconnections may be described, in accordance with the discipline knowledge, to generate propositions that are mathematically correct, indicate the occurrence of learning that is meaningful and conceptually based."

According to Ausubel's theory of meaningful learning, students' understanding is developed through the construction of their own patterns of meanings and through participation in social interactions and critiques. When new knowledge is meaningfully learnt, the student decides which established ideas in his/her cognitive structure of meanings are most relevant to it. If there are discrepancies and conflicts, the student reorganizes and reconstructs existing patterns of meanings, reformulates propositions, or forms new patterns to allow for the effective assimilation of new meaning. For example, if the student could not reconcile the apparent contradictory ideas, then a degree of synthesis (integrative reconciliation) or reorganization of existing knowledge under more inclusive and broadly explanatory principles would be attempted (progressive differentiation). In contrast, rote learning is learning where students tend to accumulate isolated propositions rather than developing integrated, interconnected hierarchical frameworks of concepts (Ausubel, 2000; Novak & Cañas, 2006). Students' conceptual understanding of a domain may be displayed on hierarchical concept maps and vee diagrams."

Over the semester, Ken transformed his evolving understanding of the relevant conceptual and methodological interconnections of key and subsidiary concepts of fractions and its progressive development across the primary years of schooling (NSWBOS, 2002) into visual displays of hierarchical conceptual interconnections on concept maps on one hand while on the other, of the synthesis of conceptual and methodological information in solving problems on vee diagrams."

For example, the \"part of a whole\" branch included the extended proposition (P1): \"Fractions\" represent \"part of a whole\" which can be represented by \"area models\" such as \"squares\", \"rectangles\" and \"circles\". Further linear linking from each of the last 3 three nodes (i.e., \"squares\", \"rectangles\" and \"circles\"), showed illustrative examples descriptively and diagrammatically."

For the \"Prior Knowledge (Principles)\" section, the principle list was now organised and labeled from P1 to P7. While the actual (P1 to P7) statements remained more or less the same as in Fig. 4.12, they would require further elaboration into more suitable theoretical justifications for each main step of the solution (displayed on the right side of the vee). For example, Principles P1 and P2 are not general statements about fractions, which would be more consistent with propositions P6 (Fig. 4.11) and P1 (Fig. 4.6). Instead, they represented Ken's interpretation of the given situation and application of proposition P6 (Fig. 4.11). As stated, these would be more suitable on the right side of the vee in the \"Interpretations (Transformations)\" section. Each principle from P4 to P7 would need to be rephrased and elaborated more fully so that they are more conceptual (i.e., general statements of relationships between concepts) and less procedural (e.g., P4, P5 and P6) to make them more suitable mathematical justifications as principles or formal statements of conceptual relationships."

The quality of his conceptual analyses and pedagogical understanding was assessed by considering the hierarchical levels of organization of the selected concepts, grouping of concepts into coherent hierarchies and their interconnections, and richness of linking words to describe the interrelationships, which collectively formed networks of propositions. In addition, the accuracy of his conceptual analyses and pedagogical understanding was judged by whether or not he had analysed all of the relevant syllabus outcomes most pertinent to the identified situation based on syllabus documentation. The resulting concept maps for Task 1 collectively explicated the progressive development of the fraction concept using the different stages of cognitive development, (i.e., the concrete, iconic, and symbolic \\(\\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right)\\)) as part of a whole, part of a collection and a number across the different stages of the PESM syllabus. The demonstrated increasing structural complexity of the five maps not only reflected the incremental depth and breadth of content coverage (according to Ken's interpretations of syllabus documentation) but also his understanding of the interconnectedness between fraction concepts and its multiple models, representations and examples as evidenced by the progressive differentiation of concepts between more inclusive and less general ones and integrative reconciliation between coherent groups of ideas. As expected at primary level, a number of illustrative examples were selected from every day contexts especially for Early Stage 1, and increasingly more use, in subsequent stages, of concrete objects, the \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) notation with selective denominators, diagrams, and number line to model, represent and demonstrate fraction types, equivalence, order and simple operations. Individually, each of the five concept maps illustrated the extent and depth of coverage to be expected for each stage in terms of the meanings to be developed using multiple models and increasingly more sophisticated development of order, equivalence and operations towards the upper stages (i.e., Stages 3 and 4). As Hierbert and Wearne (1986) argue, \"conceptual knowledge grows as additional connections are made via assimilation and integration (as) ... related bits of knowledge are related to earlier ideas\" (p. 200). Although a number of key ideas were omitted as irrelevant to the situation for Task 1, there were still some significant relevant concepts missing especially towards the upper stages."

Subsequently, over the semester, as a result of multiple cycles of presentations, social critiques and revisions, the Task 2 overview concept map evolved into a map that was organised around three main sections, each with its own particular emphasis. Focussing on the different definitions and applications of fractions in the top section, the middle section was on the definition of the notation \\(\\frac{a}{b}\\) and fraction types while the bottom section elaborated computations with fractions.

In contrast to the more abstract (i.e., general) concept maps provided in Figs. 4.1 to 4.5, the situation for this subtask was more contextualised. The most significant difference between the general and contextualised concept map was the inclusion of the \"Problem Solving\" concept hierarchy in Fig. 4.10, which introduced the concept of \"strategies\" for solving word problems, while the rest of the Fig. 4.10 nodes were similar to those previously viewed in the earlier abstract maps. Furthermore, although the \"computation\" branches of Fig. 4.6 displayed various single and mixed operations complete with illustrative examples, the distinction was that the \"word problems\" branch in the revised map (i.e., Fig. 4.11), in contrast, conveyed both the relevant conceptual propositions and problem solving strategies including the critical synthesis and application of these (hence providing the evidence of the critical thinking and reasoning involved) in the particular situation of problem 2."

More importantly, while proficiency in computations is desirable and equally important, Fig. 4.11 highlighted that being exposed to problem solving demands a much greater level of cognitive processing and critical thinking. Such higher level of reasoning would be required for constructing a vee diagram especially when completing the \"Prior Knowledge (Principles)\" and \"Interpretations (Transformations)\" sections not only to ensure a one-to-one correspondence between the listed principles on the left and the main steps of the solutions on the right but that the listed principles were appropriate general statements of relationships between concepts as mathematical justifications for the steps. According to Blanton and Kaput (2000), justification in any form is a significant part of algebraic (or mathematical) reasoning because it induces a habit of mind whereby one naturally questions and conjectures to establish a generalisation, or in the case of Ken, to establish a principle that underlies a main step in the solution. In addition, they argued that a classroom focus on justification could encourage students to conjecture in order to establish generalisations. The same can also be said for justification using principles to make explicit the conceptual bases of methods on vee diagrams and similarly to creatively structure concepts and linking words to form propositions on concept maps. Thus the data presented in this chapter demonstrated how, through the routine use of concept maps and vee diagrams, a student can develop habits of mind to conceptually and critically analyse mathematical situations, thinking and reasoning from situations and justifying interpretations and transformations in terms of the relevant substantive and syntactic knowledge of the discipline. In so doing, teachers and student teachers can develop a deeper more conceptual understanding of the structure of the relevant mathematics to pedagogically mediate meaning in an educational context."

Similarly for further improvement are the statements of principles in Fig. 4.13 to make them more theoretical, less contextualised and less procedural statements, as principled mathematical justifications for the main steps. As Ellis (2007) pointed out for justifications and generalisations, (which is equally viable for justifications and methods of solutions), \"learning mathematics in an environment in which providing justifications for one's generalisations"

That the tools have the potential to scaffold primary students' learning and understanding of mathematics and science concepts was an idea that needed empirical testing in primary classrooms. Over a period of five school terms, through professional development, on-going professional support and collaborations between teachers and university researchers, an incremental introduction of semi-structured concept maps was initiated in two primary classrooms. This classroom trial occurred over a period of time until a more receptive and conducive learning environment was established with primary students using concept maps to review their understanding of Position in the K-Year 1 classroom and Fish's Adaptive Features and Fractions in the Year 5/6 classroom. This chapter documents the professional journey of two primary teachers and their students as they struggled, persevered and succeeded in incorporating concept maps as learning and assessment tools, as part of their normal classroom practices during the year. The ultimate highlight of the innovative strategy was the initiative by the two primary teachers and their students to come together for peer tutoring and peer collaborations as the older students mentored and assisted the younger ones in using the software \\( \\text{Inspiration}^{TM} \\) to construct concept maps."

Through the meta-cognitive process of concept mapping, students can illustrate publicly their interpretation and understanding of a knowledge domain by constructing concept maps, which are hierarchical networks of interconnecting concepts (nodes) with linking words describing the nature of interconnections subsequently forming propositions (Novak, 2002). The latter are meaningful statements formed by connecting strings of \"node-linking-words \\(\\rightarrow\\) node\" that are visually displayed on a concept map. Nodes (or contents of nodes) represent key ideas, concepts or strategies most relevant to the focus of the concept map. The richness of the meaning of a particular concept (or node) is dependent on its interconnections to other surrounding concepts or the system of concepts within which it is situated or cross-linked to (examples are provided later)."

Reflection sessions, scheduled fortnightly after the workshop, enabled teachers to report back to the group regarding their progress and to discuss any emerging concerns. Over four terms in the 2006 school year, additional on-going professional support was provided in the form of site visits to the schools by the researcher (first author), consultative meetings with the teachers and more reflection sessions as the need arose, while teachers grappled with the introduction and incorporation of the innovative strategies as part of their regular classroom practices. The final concept mapping activity was the development and implementation of a teacher-initiated mapping task (i.e., final mapping project) to demonstrate the teachers' and students' evolving and increasing proficiency in constructing hierarchical concept maps as part of their classroom teaching-learning-assessment practices. Outputs from the research project were showcased in a one-day conference at the end of the 2006 school year."

Presentations from the two authors were interactive allowing teachers to field questions for clarifications of ideas and critical comments of the presented maps/diagrams. The emphasis was on introducing the innovative tools using examples previously constructed by student teachers, teachers and secondary students to illustrate the various applications of maps/diagrams in mathematics and science (a) as learning and assessment tools for the analysis of problems and activities including the illustration and communication of students' mathematical and/or scientific understanding of topics and activities, and (b) as planning tools to design teaching sequences, lesson plans and activities for teaching, learning and assessment (see Afamasaga-Fuata'i, 2005, 2004, 1998 for more details). A prepared schedule of group activities ensured teachers were progressively initiated into a different and innovative way of thinking with sufficient time and practice to experience for themselves the strategies of concept mapping and vee diagramming firstly as a community of learners during and after the PD and before they can be expected, in professional practice, to pedagogically introduce the strategies in their classrooms. For small group activities, the teachers collaboratively and cooperatively co-constructed science and mathematics concept maps, by brainstorming and negotiating ideas about what counts as key concepts and strategies of a topic or activity, compiling the brainstormed ideas into concept lists, ranking them from most general to most specific, and then meaningfully organizing them into coherent hierarchies before linking concepts and describing the nature of inter-relationships using \"linking words\", which consequently formed hierarchical networks of interconnecting propositions. Group presentations of concept maps and peer critique followed each small-group activity thus providing critical feedback to further improve the clarity and transparency of conceptual connections."

The meetings discussed at length the basic literacy and numeracy problems of their students and other problems concerning school support services, which impinged on the teachers' capacities to participate more fully in the research project. In recognition of these practical demands on teachers' time, it was mutually agreed that initially, they would trial only concept maps, not vee diagrams, in their classrooms. Subsequently, it was suggested that the Year 5/6 would begin with a class-constructed map whilst the Year 2/3/4 class would begin with individually-constructed maps given the existing diversity of student abilities within this one class. Again, both teachers reiterated their preference to work with concept maps only. The outcome of the discussion was for both teachers to focus on concept maps in the next few weeks and for the researcher to visit their classrooms for observation of the language used in their teaching (i.e., classroom discourse). The latter was important in order to authentically base further suggestions on how concept maps could be developed to closely align with the teachers' existing pedagogical practices and classroom discourse as"

Of particular interest for concept mapping purposes was the language Sue (a pseudonym) used during the lesson, which provided an authentic and appropriate basis for a list of words to begin constructing a concept map. Whilst observing the lesson, the researcher also noted that some of the students struggled when doing some of the problems on their own. In Fig. 5.1 is an example of one of the concept maps constructed by the researcher based on a problem the Year 5/6 class was engaged with during the classroom-observation visit. Figure 5.2 shows the concept map coconstructed by the Year 5/6 class and facilitated by the teacher as evidence of her self-initiated attempt at incorporating a concept map into her classroom activities prior to the observation visit."

Using Ruiz-Primo's (2004) continuum of directedness, concept maps may be classified on the basis of the amount of information (i.e., concept lists, linking words, and/or hierarchical structure) that is provided as part of the mapping task. Specifically, the continuum ranges from \"high directedness\" to \"low directedness\" where the least cognitively demanding task is the Fill-in-the-Map (i.e., Fill-in-Lines or Fill-in-Nodes) type on the left side of the continuum with the Construct-a-Map (no concepts, linking words or structure provided)) type on the extreme right as the most demanding. In between, from left to right are Construct-a-Map (Concepts & Linking Phrases Provided); Construct-a-Map (Concepts Provided & Structure Suggested) and Construct-a-Map (Concepts Provided). More importantly, the researcher's portfolio of semi-structured concept maps, consisted of a variety of Fill-in-Nodes and Fill-in-Lines maps, based on the observed Year 5/6 lesson on Addition of Decimals, and others from the Stages 1 (Years 1–2) to 3 (Years 5–6) of the NSW K-6 Mathematics Syllabus (NSWBOS, 2002) such as Lines, Shapes, and Geometry (see Figs. 5.3, 5.4 and 5.5) specifically designed to supplement the Construct-a-Map types that were collaboratively developed by the teachers during the PD workshop."

Accordingly, the K-Year 1 teacher advised she was working with students on describing relative Positions of objects by taking the whole class for a walk around the school grounds followed by further review of student understanding by using a wall-size picture of the school grounds. The Year 5/6 teacher, in comparison, had been teaching Watery Environment in the previous two weeks and had already started to brainstorm ideas with her students using a concept map (see Fig. 5.2). Outcomes of this consultative meeting were that (1) the researcher would drop off samples of maps the following week and (2) classroom visits would be scheduled soon after."

By working through each link on the map and by posing questions, Carrie invited students to suggest how the links should be described. The class demonstration was followed with individual work in which students were asked to write in \"descriptions of positions\" on the blank links. Assisting students individually and in small groups were two parent-teacher aides, the teacher associate and Carrie. Shown in Fig. 5.6 is an example of a student-completed concept map from this first activity. In her written assessment of the activity, Carrie wrote: \"I was pleasantly surprised to see how well the children coped with this activity and were able to use the language of position\". For further improvement, she recommended that, for subsequent activities, \"As this class is Early Stage 1, most children had some difficulty writing the words onto the lines. I recommend labels be used\"."

Interestingly, instead of working individually or in small groups but individually completing their own maps, this time Carrie organised the students into 4 small groups with each student having up to 2 turns in gluing in a cardboard word on the appropriate link thereby completing a group map cooperatively and more efficiently. Indeed, this development demonstrated positive growth in progressively developing class/group arrangements to enhance the efficiency of completing mapping activities. Carrie's increasingly refined execution of the activities reflected her growing enthusiasm and demonstrated her developing confidence with the whole idea of concept mapping. Figure 5.8b shows an example of a collaboratively-constructed concept map for this activity. Carrie wrote in her reflection journal: \"This activity worked much better as each child took it in turns to pick up a card. They all assisted in positioning it onto the map\". In her assessment of the results of the concept map activity, she wrote: \"The children worked well. Cards had to be read to them and children helped each other to position them on map. Final maps were done well\"."

For example, the K-Year 1 teacher and her students were constructing hierarchical concept maps by revising and extending their class-constructed mind map"

The final reflection session was valuable and informative in that it enabled the researcher to share with the two teachers her views of their successful progress in spite of initial difficulties, and the two teachers also shared their own reflections of their experiences and completed an evaluation questionnaire. For example, the teachers commented: \"the lesson (using concept maps was) quite successful and the concept map was a very useful tool in enhancing the learning that had already taken place prior to the mapping activity\" and \"valuable for (her) to see that the (students) could apply (their) knowledge in a more abstract way.\""

Secondly, the sessions enabled discussions and sharing of ideas amongst professionals on how an innovative strategy that was perceived as being too difficult could be modified and applied to primary level topics. Through the convergence of reflective thinking and professional collaboration and cooperation over two school terms, an incremental approach was eventually determined for the MPS classes, which was more appropriate and less cognitively demanding for primary students particularly in the initial introductory stage. An essential component of the research project was the promotion of collegial interactions and professional exchanges in a non-threatening environment, particularly in the early stages, to support teachers as they struggled to come to terms with the innovative strategies."

As Grimbeek and Nisbet (2006) pointed out, professional development for a particular purpose (in this case, innovation) is an ongoing and cyclical process that focuses on developing teachers' knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about the innovation, and including as well teacher change, which would not come about unless teachers themselves experienced demonstrable success of the innovation on student learning. In line with this perspective, there was evidence in the data presented, which demonstrated that the MPS teacher were sufficiently convinced of the value of concept mapping on their students' learning for them to have gone as far as they did and designed, along with their students, final projects"

Firstly, a focus on the conceptual interconnections provides students with the opportunity to clarify their own understanding of the links and integration between concepts. These maps then represent a snapshot of student understanding at a particular point in time. Assessing the displayed connections or systems of interconnecting concepts can reveal the extent to which meaningful learning has taken place leading to further reflection and discourse, not only with the individual student, but with other students as well. For example, assessing the entries on the concept map provides an opportunity for the"

It is now up to the teachers to go forward with the strategies in ways that are suitable for their students as learning and/or assessment tools. The MPS teachers indicated that they are continuing with concept mapping as a strategy to brainstorm ideas about a new topic and then as an assessment tool after a unit by having students construct concept maps to indicate their understanding. Peer tutoring was also highly recommended as a means of working collaboratively with new students and/or new schools as a way forward. These suggestions, based on the teachers' own experiences, provide viable directions for further research to identify the most efficient ways of transforming research-based ideas into actual practice in more real classrooms for a wider impact."

Novak claims that meaningful learning (ML) is the result of the constructive integration of thinking, feeling and acting leading to the empowerment for commitment and responsibility. From his constructivist approach, Novak (1988) stresses the concept of ML and the way it is treated by Ausubel, Novak, and Hanesian (1976) in his assimilation theory."

From the earliest times, proportionality has played a part in human understanding of the surrounding world. Thus, for example, faced with the impossibility of directly measuring distances, resort was made to comparative methods. The idea first arose in astronomy and later in science as a whole, both for defining new magnitudes and for expressing numerical relationships, working with indices, constants or rates. Proportionality is therefore a basic concept in mathematics and is of major importance in the school curriculum (Fiol & Fortune, 1990), since it is associated with most mathematical content and the content of other subjects such as physics, biology, chemistry, etc. It is not a simple concept, however. Rapetti (2003) noted that it is not easy to acquire the notion of proportion because it challenges learners with a range of situations of varying levels of numerical complexity and different types of magnitudes. The need to consider quantities in relation to one another, in addition to approaching them in absolute terms, presents a problem to some learners and creates an obstacle to their understanding of the mathematical content surrounding the notion of proportionality."

Although proportions played a fundamental role for the Pythagoreans, historically, this proved to be a major obstacle in the development of the general concept of function. When working with proportions, it is hard to identify the relationship between two different magnitudes, since compared magnitudes are not always of the same nature. Proportions therefore conceal the underlying interdependence of different magnitudes. The Greeks,"

(1976), to take into account pupils' prior knowledge of the topic to be dealt with in the classroom. The maps produced by the students prior to instruction can be used to establish each individual's point of departure in the learning process. Ausubel also proposed that the more inclusive concepts relating to the topic be presented at the start of the instruction period, and that the more specific concepts be dealt with later. Hence there is a need to clarify which concepts are to be included in the instruction, define their meaning, identify the hierarchical relationships and reconciliations between them and establish how this frame of reference relates to what the pupils already know. Novak recommends teachers to create a reference map, to arrange the relevant concepts, both inclusive and specific, relating to the chosen topic; in this case, proportionality. Once the reference map has been created (see Fig. 6.1), one can proceed to identifying the most significant conceptual nodes around which to plan and schedule classroom activities."

In the final level of the hierarchical map, therefore, we can see specific examples of such situations. The map does not reflect the necessary condition of the equality of corresponding angles when defining similar figures; it simply reflects the fact that proportional reasoning is involved in the definition. The map was meant, moreover, to clearly illustrate the difference between ratio defined as a relationship between different values of the same magnitude and the proportional relationship that may exist between two different magnitudes, as well as the different ways in which this proportional relationship can be expressed. Thus, the four ways of expressing a relationship between two magnitudes appear on the right-hand side of the map, indicating in each case the type of proportional relationship involved, that is, whether it is directly or inversely proportional. The concept of ratio is defined as in the vast majority of lower secondary school mathematics textbooks, despite the fact that Freudenthal (1983) considers such a definition to be a violation of its meaning."

The instructional sequence was adapted from Project LEAP (Learning about Ecology, Animals and Plants, 1995). This was a plan that grouped activities into three stages: introduction, focusing and summary. The process begins with the presentation of the most inclusive concepts, after which progressive differentiations and the more significant reconciliations are made, before finally applying the information discussed throughout the instruction period. When designing activities for this module, which was written in the Basque language ready for presentation in the classroom, ideas were taken from several published texts."

From the methodological point of view, pupils were expected to work individually during the presentation and summary stages, and in small groups of five during the focusing stage. Although group work in the classroom was not standard practice during mathematics lessons, the second grade students on the whole showed a positive attitude towards working in groups, except for a few isolated cases of low contributors. During the instruction period, the pupils also created additional concept maps using CmapTools software, already installed in the computers in the school's computer room. Concept mapping did not form part of the standard mathematics program at the school but had been adopted by the natural science department. The pupils in this age group were therefore already trained in the creation of concept maps relating to the content of the area of natural sciences, and thus had no difficulty in using the technique. In the last activity of the instructional module, each student was asked to produce a final concept map using the 25 concepts that had featured in the reference map prior to instruction."

That is, they used a greater number of concepts in the map prior to instruction than in the one they created after instruction was complete. The majority of the pupils were found to make more use of the concepts in the second map than in the first, 11 pupils having managed to use all 25 concepts (higher frequency of use). It is important to stress that 24 out of the 32 pupils did not use the concept ratio in the map drawn prior to instruction. Of these, 21 introduced it in the second map; pupils numbers 24, 25 and 26 failed to use it in either of their maps, while pupil number two used it in the first but not in the second. With regard to the three examples featured on the list of concepts: bank interest, plan of an apartment and treble the side of the figure, it should be noted that, of the whole group, 27 pupils failed to use one, two or three of these examples in the map prior to instruction."

Judging from the pattern that can be observed when the two maps of each pupil are compared for the percentage of erroneous or inaccurate propositions out of the total, the pupil's cognitive structure can also be said to have become more logical.

In the case that concerns us, it was possible to observe similar groupings of maps with similar characteristics. Thus, one of the first tendencies to be observed was the obvious restructuring in the post-instruction map made by three of our pupils, who were able to produce something very close to the reference map they had been shown. The pre-and post-instruction maps made by pupil, I.I., (see Figs. 6.2 and 6.3) are included as an illustration of the progress made by this group of students."

The map of one of the two teachers reveals that she possesses these understandings. The map of the other shows a formalistic understanding of mathematics.

This is clearly the case in the US where, despite the emphasis on conceptual understanding that characterizes the reform standards of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM, 1989, 2000), concept mapping in mathematics continues to be under utilized. This is unfortunate, since it has the potential to begin to counteract the superficial treatment of concepts occasioned by the failure to develop a coherent curriculum that identifies essential concepts and probes them in sufficient depth (Schmidt, Houang, & Cogan, 2002). Indeed one of the outcomes of the TIMSS study was the characterization of the US curriculum as \"a mile wide and an inch deep\". The standards developed by the fifty states continue to reflect the prevailing national tendency toward a multiplicity of topics and consequent superficial coverage of mathematics concepts."

The inclusion of procedures in the focal points is significant, since although they were not excluded in the NCTM Standards, procedures have clearly been de-emphasized in much of the published literature. In addition, reform mathematics curricula in the US have all but abandoned the teaching of algorithms in recent years, preferring to consign computation to calculators instead (Morrow, 1998). This practice has not only been widely criticized (Wu, 1999; Schmittau, 2004), but has, in fact, been a major factor in fueling the US \"math wars\"."

So accepted has the presumed dichotomy between concepts and procedures become, that the nation's leading newspapers reported that the NCTM focal points represented a move \"back to basics\", a reference to the rote learning of mechanical procedures that had often characterized mathematics learning prior to the reforms heralded by the NCTM Standards (1989). These media reports prompted the NCTM president to write letters to the editors of two of the most prominent US newspapers, the New York Times and the Washington Post, in an attempt to correct this misperception and reaffirm NCTM's commitment to conceptual understanding as well as procedural competence in mathematics. Indeed, rather than a mechanical \"back to basics\" approach to the teaching of mathematics procedures, the focal points appropriately require that students understand the meaning behind the mathematical algorithms in which they are to demonstrate fluency. It is important, therefore, that algorithms be understood and taught not as divorced from concepts, but as historical and epistemological analysis reveals them to be - namely, fully conceptual cultural historical products. Concept mapping can serve as a useful tool to enable the linking of algorithms with their conceptual content."

In such a circumstance, it is advantageous to construct a larger unit (or multiple) of the unit of interest, and use it to take an indirect count. This is done in the case of the area of a rectangle, for example, where the number of unit squares in a row are counted, and then the number of rows are counted in order to indirectly obtain the area as the number of square units."

It is not sufficient that the calculator can call up these \"facts\"; they must be stored in the human memory if they are to be recognized in subsequent mathematical studies in the myriad of conceptual interrelationships into which they enter. Janet refers to these in her concept map, indicating that their commitment to memory is important for mathematical understanding, and should not be by-passed as is often now occurring in the wake of the reform movement. All of these points were emphasized during our extensive class discussions of the concept of multiplication and the various numerical domains in which it is defined. During these we noted the inadequacy of the \"repeated addition\" definition that is ubiquitous in US textbooks (Schmittau, 2003). Accordingly, neither Janet nor Stephen invoked this notion in their concept maps of multiplication."

Further, Al-Khowarizmi invented this method one thousand years ago, some 500 years before the creation of algebraic symbols. So immediately engaging students at the level of symbolic expression omits from their ontogenetic experience the equivalent of hundreds of years in the phylogenetic development of this concept.

A teacher who possesses these understandings may be expected to point out the connection to multiplication of negative numbers when multiplication of complex numbers is taught. None of my graduate students in mathematics have ever made this connection. They learn it for the first time in my graduate course."

Janet's map gives evidence that she possesses the requisite conceptual understanding, and historical and pedagogical content knowledge, to mediate the concept of multiplication meaningfully to students, without separating its so-called \"procedural\" from its \"conceptual\" content. Indeed, it appears that she can move rather seamlessly between the two. Stephen's map, in its entirety, has considerable extension, encompassing multiplication of matrices, determinants, and the cross products of vectors. But the connections are consistently formalist and give no evidence that his teaching will go beyond a formalistic approach. Both students are nearing completion of the masters' degree, but their maps reveal very different understandings of this fundamental concept."

In the examples above, the concept maps produced were made subsequent to class discussions and presentations on the conceptual and historical analyses of multiplication with masters' level students preparing to be high school teachers. I typically require that doctoral students conduct such analyses on their own and frame pedagogical recommendations for the improvement of instruction based upon their findings. James Vagliardo's analysis of the concept of logarithm is illustrative of the role of concept mapping in this process (cf. Chapter 9)."

In mapping mathematical concepts taught in middle school and searching for their conceptual roots, it becomes clear that the concept of positional system, for example, is a central antecedent concept with the power to render more effectively the meaning of such concepts as decimals, fractions, and polynomials (cf. Chapter 3). But the concept of positional system cannot be attained by studying only base ten (Vygotsky, 1986); for adequate conceptualization of such a superordinate concept the study of multiple bases is required. The folly of superficially covering many topics is simultaneously revealed; only by establishing a conceptual base of concepts central to the future development of mathematics, can students begin to grasp the nature of mathematics as a conceptual system. Yet two decades into the reform movement, US curricula continue to cover too many topics each year, to repeat the same topics year after year, and with little increase in depth (Schmidt, Houang, & Cogan, 2002). The NCTM focal points if properly implemented may serve as a much needed corrective to this situation. It would seem that their implementation and the reform movement in mathematics as well could benefit from the pedagogical potential of concept mapping."

Through in-class presentations and critiques of concept maps, student teachers engaged in the processes of reasoning, justifying, verifying, and validating to ensure that visually displayed interconnections effectively reflected their intended meanings. Bobby's concept maps presented here, illustrate the conceptual structure underpinning a teaching sequence, a lesson and an assessment plan as part of a required course assignment, to communicate his perceptions of what it means to developmentally and conceptually teach \"Derivatives\" in contrast to simply compiling a sequential list of sub-topics. Main insights from the findings suggested that constructing concept maps (a) prompted Bobby to reflect more deeply about his own mathematics knowledge beyond the assignment topic and (b) challenged him to strategically organize his conceptual analysis results into hierarchical displays of concept networks to parsimoniously and meaningfully illustrate the interconnectedness between key and subsidiary concepts as his pedagogical planning progresses from a 2-year curriculum and topic syllabus notes to a teaching sequence, lessons and an assessment plan."

By constructing concept maps and vee diagrams (maps/diagrams), students illustrate publicly their interpretation and understanding of a topic/problem in terms of interconnections between concepts, principles and methods. Concept maps are hierarchical graphs of interconnecting concept nodes with links connecting relevant concepts. Descriptive words on the links describe the meaning of the relationship between the connected concepts. Examples of concept maps are provided later. A vee diagram, on the other hand, is a vee structure situated in a problem with its lefthand side depicting the conceptual information underpinning the methods of solving a problem displayed on the righthand side. Vee diagrams are not presented in this chapter but some examples are found in Chapters 2 and 4."

Through participation in social critiques over the semester, students received constructive feedback to further improve their individually-constructed maps/diagrams. Their final topic-concept-maps were structurally more complex and differentiated than initial maps as a result of thinking and reflecting about their own understanding, interacting with others and concept mapping. Whilst these studies focused on undergraduate students' use of maps/diagrams as learning tools, the main study that is reported here was with student teachers at an Australian regional university; it focused on the applications of maps/diagrams as pedagogical tools to analyse syllabus documentations and to plan learning activities."

Not surprisingly, Bobby called this preparatory stage \"the verb-type\" by which he meant \"the act of doing the map\" and is \"represented by a pseudo-algorithm to draw the concept map - such as choosing key concepts and possible links\".

Basically conjecturing that these \"2 maps and their differences could be described by Vygotsky's zone of proximal development\", he explained that, \"I was confused as to whether I was mapping my 'prior knowledge construct map' or the 'map of best description' and so I struggled with the concept maps\".

That is, explicating the purpose and focus of map first ensures the appropriate selection of concepts, hierarchical organization and suitable linking of relevant nodes to enhance the map's overall cohesiveness and"

Consequently over the semester, Bobby learnt to interact and respond appropriately to critical comments as he argued the correctness of his maps, provided counter-arguments to points raised by his peers, or sought modifications of maps when justifiable. Through these social negotiations, argument and debate, the student teacher demonstrated growing awareness of the importance of adjusting the level of his mathematical language (manifested as concept labels and linking words) to be consistent with the recommended level of the syllabus' staged outcomes. Furthermore, student teachers voluntarily shared their reflections of their experiences simultaneously encouraging others to do the same. Ensuing discussions therefore, focussed on how their mapping experiences impacted on the way they planned, thought and viewed the development of teaching sequences/learning activities. For example, Bobby discussed initial difficulties as he learnt to concept map problems/activities/units such as the difficulty of identifying appropriate and concise labels for main ideas, clarifying the purpose and focus of maps, and determining the most suitable hierarchies. However, through workshop discourse, Bobby's concerns were eventually clarified. Through the discussion of his reflections, he demonstrated an in-depth engagement and reflective practice with the task of concept mapping which, previously, independently prompted him to schematise the mapping process as \"dimensions\" to qualitatively clarify the purpose and focus of concept maps and to distinguish between general abstract concept maps (Type 2) such as the teaching-sequence one (Fig. 8.4) and the more contextualised one presented here of the lesson plan (Figs. 8.5, 8.6, 8.7 and 8.8)."

With workshop presentations and reflection sessions focussing on concept maps, ensuing discourse brainstormed multiple ways in which classroom activities could be supported and facilitated through having their future students present and communicate their mathematical understanding via concept maps.

Since completed, practice and final maps encapsulated both the conceptual and epistemological frameworks of a topic, through their construction, the student teacher routinely searched for connections between key and subsidiary concepts, and whilst doing so, he made insightful observations about the qualitative distinction between the nature of maps, depending on their purpose and focus, in terms of a two-dimensional schema, to distinguish between maps that are more abstract as in topic concept maps or those that are more concrete as in the lesson-plan-concept-map. For example, he also distinguished between dimensions of a concept map when"

Too often mathematical course content is presented as an approach to a currently considered problem with the mediation of deeper meaning and the connections to other mathematical ideas left unaddressed. The development of mathematical mindfulness requires that educators substantively address the topics they teach by locating the conceptual essence of fundamental ideas from a cultural-historical context. This important pedagogical work can be enhanced through the skilful use of concept mapping. This chapter provides an in-depth look at how concept mapping can be used in the development of a meaningful secondary mathematics' curriculum that avoids rote learning and favors transcendent cognitive development."

The chapter illustrates an approach to mathematics' education that first uses concept maps in conjunction with a direct effort to locate the historically grounded conceptual essence of a significant mathematical concept. Without historical context, mathematics' educators may easily be unaware of the conceptual essence of the concepts they teach. Concept mapping is shown to address this shortcoming. Empirical research is then guided by concept mapping in order to expose the \"operating understanding\" among students and their teachers revealing specific metonymic inadequacies that exist. By comparative use of concept maps, weak or missing crosslinks are readily identified. Together, these uses of concept mapping inform and guide the design of mathematics' lessons that mediate mathematical understanding in a profound way. Concept mapping is thus shown to provide a useful approach to secondary mathematics' education curricular reform aimed at meaningful learning."

Inversely, mindless use usually involves weak or nonexistent conscious awareness of purpose or meaning involved in activity. Langer (1989) suggests that such mindfulness may be rooted in the development of automatic behavior through repetition and practice. Premature cognitive commitment on the part of a learner, a commitment to an early understanding that lacks the full development that can be achieved through thoughtful contemplation and study of the underlying concepts involved from a historical perspective, may also be the cause. Mindlessness can be induced by organizations with an orientation focused on outcomes, with minor attention given to conceptualization and a focused dependency on rote learning."

On the contrary, substantive knowledge is grounded in such considerations. An intellectual dedication to a continual search for new and deeper understanding, relating new conceptualizations to current knowledge, may be dependent upon the purity of initial substantive knowledge. Subsequent thought and study is then more likely to locate conceptual crosslinks, and may, over time, lead to the emergence of mental models that reflect the essence of the original idea."

The logarithm is a concept whose understanding must be mediated by knowledgeable and skillful instruction to be well understood. Results of the clinical component of the study provide evidence of the need for conceptual intervention through improved curriculum design based on concept mapping and historical research as a combined epistemological tool. This is done in the context of the philosophical and theoretical ideas of Lev Vygotsky (1978) and the notions of concept formation and generalization of V. V.

A composite map reflecting all understandings and relationships was also created for purposes of contrasting perceptions. The map further displays traditional instructional content, current curricular focus, and implications for the study of calculus, advanced science, and technology. By means of this composite map, six clinical analysis categories were identified and addressed. Of significance in considering curriculum development are the categories of \"Conceptual Representation,\" \"Student Competency and Problem Complexity,\" and \"Application and Importance.\" Findings in these areas translated into the development of a significant change in pedagogical approach illustrated in a series of introductory logarithm lessons."

I refer to the notions that cognitive structure is hierarchically organized, that this structure is progressively differentiated, and that the process of integrative reconciliation may yield linkage between concepts providing new propositional meaning. The historical record of Napier's work also reveals strong evidence in support of Vygotsky's thoughts on cultural mediation. Napier's discovery is a perfect example of integrative reconciliation. His particular linkage of geometry and arithmetic has impacted the world for nearly four hundred years."

Consider that point P starts at A and moves along segment AB at a speed proportional to its remaining distance from B. Simultaneously, point Q departs from C and moves along ray CD with a constant speed equal to the starting speed of P. Napier called the distance CQ the logarithm of PB. This idea proved to be an important benchmark in the history of mathematical thought, providing a crosslink between concepts that immediately accelerated the interests of science and economics. The genesis of Napier's discovery is situated in Egyptian, Greek, Hindu, and Arabic thought and reflects the influence of the Renaissance on scientific thinking. From the Egyptian papyrus of Ahmes we see work on the reduction of fractions of the form \\(2/(2n+1)\\) into a sum of fractions with numerators of one, an early form of computational efficiency. As the flow of ideas is transmitted between cultures, the Greeks provide theoretical structure to mathematical thought. Pythagoras establishes the twice split view of mathematics (Fig. 9.2) (Turnbull, 1969) that places arithmetic and geometry on distinctly separate branches. Hindu mathematics, like the Greek, considered arithmetic and geometry as separate categories of mathematics. It is a significant conceptual separation that becomes the focus in the late sixteenth century; ideas actually crosslinked by Napier."

It is this connection that accounts for the computational power and efficiency the logarithm provides and justifies the importance of this discovery in the historical account of mathematical development. The map situates the conceptual genesis of a new mathematical idea, a realization of a connection between arithmetic and geometry. This relationship is the substantive understanding that requires mediational attention if students are to make sense of their work with logarithms. The mapping across two previously considered disjoint branches of mathematical thought is the core of the logarithm concept, an idea that became of prime interest with the later discovery of exponents and the emergence of calculus."

By doing so with logarithms, it may be possible to close the gap of graphical understanding that is evident among students and simultaneously reveal the computational consequence that enabled the scientific community. The four lessons that follow are presented toward that end. The first lesson addresses the essence and origin of the concept. The second lesson presents the link between the conceptualization of a logarithm as a relation between moving points and the graphical representation of that relation. The third lesson shows the impact of Napier's discovery on computational efficiency and accuracy. The final lesson cites two sources that develop the use of logarithmic scales for use in mathematical reasoning. Lessons presented are each grounded in an understanding of arithmetic and geometric sequences. The computational significance of the mapping between these sequences reveals the essence and power of logarithms."

The doubling metric will allow students to later ascend from this abstraction to the concrete where any acceleration rate will be easy to understand since they will be simple instantiations of the correct abstraction. The base 2 logarithms used will also allow an easy bridge to the computational lesson that follows. The lesson should proceed with students considering the differences they recognize in points along line 1 versus those along line 2. It should become apparent that the distances are growing rapidly along line 1 and steadily along line 2. Connections to previous student understanding of arithmetic and geometric sequences, can be accented. The discussion should lead to defining the logarithm of the distance a point has moved along line 1, as the distance that the corresponding point has moved along line 2. That is to say, the logarithm of distance PQ is distance \\(\\mathrm{P}^{\\prime}\\mathrm{Q}^{\\prime}\\) in Fig. 9.1. This is not quite the same definition Napier gave us, but similarly captures the essence of a logarithm and may more clearly introduce students to the concept in a substantive and mindful way. For those students who ask \"So what?\" the argument can be made at this stage that the points along line 1 will soon accelerate out of sight but their corresponding points will still be visible along line 2 enabling us to keep track of where they are along line 1 as a result of this logarithmic relationship.

By means of this lesson activity students can generate a partial graph of the log function and discuss the related growth rates along the axes. Discussion can explore hypotheses about what happens to the graph between plotted points and later, when metrics are incorporated, what this means about other logarithmic values.

Compared to the standard multiplication algorithm, this calculation would require more than 150 operations to complete, with the chance for error very likely. With a previously established conceptual understanding of sequences students can develop the laws that govern the computational use of logarithms as a concrete consequence. Notational expressions of these laws should be simple to grasp for the conceptual foundation of the relationship has been well established."

A natural place for students to begin, therefore, is a study of the nature of arithmetic and geometric sequences. Such a unit should precede work with logs. The origin of the idea has been shown to be the geometric problem posed by Napier in the Mirifici. Selectively replicating that problem, with a slight modification for simplicity as presented in lesson 1, is intended to overcome the conceptual disconnect so apparent in student and teacher interviews presented here. This means the introduction of the concept can focus on the essence of the original idea. The relationship, as evidenced by the concept map presented in Fig. 9.3, would suggest looking at the idea computationally, algebraically, and geometrically. The model that best captures the nature of the relationship is the graph of the function as well as the use of logarithmic scales. Syntactic representational competence should follow naturally, allowing students to make sense of written mathematics and to express themselves correctly in written form. Since notion of exponents developed historically after logarithms, the lessons provided here are not justified on the basis of exponents, an approach that seems unnecessary. Perhaps exponents should be presented to students after work with logarithms. Concept relevance is evidenced by the long list of scientific applications and the role the idea played historically in the development of a wide range of calculating machines. These curricular suggestions attempt to capture the conceptual essence, historical relevance and cultural implications of this significant mathematical idea. The goal of promoting substantive knowledge and student mindfulness may be well served with this instructional approach."

Concept mapping, when combined with historical research, serves as an important epistemological tool that can render to consciousness the conceptual essence of a mathematical idea. In conjunction with empirical data, concept maps can also be used to expose the operating understanding of important mathematical concepts held by students and their teachers. These direct uses of concept mapping in turn provide the means for educators to identify substantive focus for curriculum design and provide pedagogical direction toward the mindful use of learned mathematics on the part of students. Meaningful instruction in mathematics avoids the temptation of a rote learning approach, recognizing that focus on functional efficiency often leads to cognitive deficiency. Complex problem solving depends on the thoughtful application of meaningful mathematical ideas. In this regard concept mapping can instruct and guide mathematics educators toward a pedagogy of significant cognitive consequence."

Beyond being an indispensable component in the definition of metric concepts that express physical magnitudes, it allows the construction of mathematical models to represent multiple physical phenomena. Mathematical models have several applications in physics. First year physics students often ignore the important role mathematics and particularly mathematical models play in the learning of physics. Students limit themselves to the use of a menu of equations often misunderstood as a set of \"cook-book\" procedures applied to solve physics problems, without a real understanding of the reason for using a particular function or model to solve a problem. This chapter reflects on the outcome of a research project undertaken at \"Universidad Nacional del Tachira\" (UNET), Venezuela, which focuses on the different ways teachers and students could use concept mapping and Gowin's Vee for the mathematical modelling of physical phenomena. We have designed a strategy for the teaching and learning of mathematical models most used in first year physics courses. This strategy uses concept maps to improve understanding of basic conceptual structures involved in the mathematical modelling process of physical phenomena, and Gowins' Vee as a tool that facilitates the process of building a student's own knowledge of a mathematical model for a particular experiment."

In physics, this feature is also found, but it is not the only activity present, as this natural science also requires the application of induction, inherent in the scientific method to build up knowledge about the real world. The language used to express physical knowledge about the world has universal elements of mathematical language used by all scientists, as well as idiomatic language, which is specific to each country. The symbolic, syntactic and semantics terms of the language of mathematics are acquired by someone after those terms are acquired as part of a specific idiomatic language.

These mathematical models are based on essential concepts of function theory.

Observe that this is a knowledge representation about a particular main idea (in this case, frame of reference), in the form of a graph comprising boxes connected with labeled lines. Words or phrases that denote concepts (events, objects) are placed inside the boxes, and relationships between different concepts are specified on each line. Propositions (node - link - node triads) are a unique feature of concept maps, compared to other graphs. Propositions consist of two or more concept labels connected by a linking relationship that forms a semantic unit (Novak & Gowin, 1988). And the reader, if not familiar with concept maps, may know some of the concepts mentioned before as separate entities but have no clear sense of the relationships between some of them. Obviously, this makes it difficult to understand the whole conceptual structure concept map. Let us then discuss some of the concepts involved in this definition: object, event, concept, proposition and meaningful relationships, to be able to understand what a concept map is."

Each proposition is a sentence that has a unique standardized truth value (true or false) that is the basis for arguing whether the graph makes true or false assertions. Consider the following sentences: (a) \"Complex numbers include natural numbers\" and (b) \"Mars has a unique moon\". These sentences are propositions with a truth value (propositions \\( a \\) is true and \\( b \\) is false). In comparison, consider the following sentence: \"Mathematics problems are easy to solve\". This sentence is not a proposition as there is no way to know whether it is true or false.

In order to expand on this concept (i.e., concept polygons), subordinate (less important) concepts related to it begin to emerge.

This will help them to organise themselves in order to plan, carry out the experiment, collect raw data, transform and graph data, and finally analyze the results obtained. The construction of the conceptual side begins with a student studying the regularities about the events or object being investigated, which will lead him or her to concepts, hypothesis models and theories. On the other side, students will be making decisions about the methodological procedure they will follow in order to study a particular phenomenon. Gowin's Vee is a useful device to establish relationships between the conceptual and practical sides of a laboratory activity and it also helps to structure the discussions that precede and follow the practical activity."

Secondly, a qualitative analysis of interviews conducted with students allowed the assessment of the degree of comprehension, about the understanding of potential uses of both heuristic tools. These two perspectives were directed towards the same final objective, which was the evaluation of the strategy used. The application of two distinctly different analytical approaches has a parallel in the physical sciences. It is evident, for instance, with the corpuscular and wave models for the nature of light, in which the Complementary Principle allows the acceptance of both models as contributors to the knowledge of this physical entity (light) without imposing the need that one of them prevails over the other. This was the case with the two dialectic perspectives adopted to evaluate the strategy, with each providing different information. It was possible to obtain evidence for the number of successful learning cases using the quantitative approach, and also to determine a general consensus about the comprehension of models and ability to apply them, using the qualitative approach."

In comparison, beginners find it more difficult to make a map from the contents given in a presentation or a lesson. A lower percentage \\((58\\%)\\) was obtained when students were asked to build concept maps in Phase II about mathematical functions following their class notes and what the teacher said in the lab class.

This requires that the concepts first be connected to the current knowledge of the person doing the mapping. This meaningful learning takes place for the teacher as well as the student. The teacher also can use the student maps to determine to what extent the student grasps the ideas and their relationships to one another.

We see from these that the degree of the polynomial that is the sum of two non-zero monomials is the larger of the degrees of the two. This tells us that the degree of the sum of any two polynomials will be the larger of the degrees of the two polynomials being added. Also from Fig. 11.2, the degree of the product of two non-zero monomials is the sum of the degrees of the two monomials. From the map in Fig. 11.4, the term in the product of two non-zero polynomials that will have the largest degree will be the product of the term in the first polynomial having largest degree among the terms of that first polynomial, with the term in the second polynomial having the largest degree among that polynomial's terms. Thus, the degree of the product of any two non-zero polynomials will be the sum of the degrees of the two. We see from Fig. 11.2 that the product of the zero polynomial any other polynomial is always the zero polynomial, so such a property of degrees (the degree of the product is the sum of the degrees of the two factors) would not hold if one of the two polynomials were the polynomial \\(\\mathbf{0}\\).

We also think of the monomial as being a mathematical product of the coefficient \\( \\mathbf{c} \\) and the \\( \\mathbf{n} \\)th power of some unspecified number \\( \\mathbf{x} \\). Thus, when we replace the variable \\( x \\) with a specific real number, we can calculate the resulting product. This is called evaluating the monomial at the specified number. For example, if we evaluate the monomial \\( 4x^{3} \\) at \\( x = 5 \\), we get \\( 4 \\times 5^{3} \\), or 500. Polynomials are evaluated at a specified number by evaluating each of the monomial terms at that number value, and then adding the results. This can be put into a concept map as in Fig. 11.5."

Constructing comprehensive topic concept maps, and Vee diagrams of problems as ongoing exercises throughout the semester was a requirement of the study. Students quickly found that learning about the new tools and a new topic was demanding. However, they also found that the concurrent use of the two tools in learning a new topic contributed substantively in highlighting the close correspondence between the conceptual structure of the topic and its methods. Having students display their developing understanding and knowledge on maps/diagrams greatly facilitated discussions, critiques, dialogues and communications during seminar presentations and one-on-one consultations. Maps/diagrams were qualitatively assessed three times during the study period. It was found that there was noticeable growth in students' in-depth understanding of topics as indicated by increased valid propositions and structural complexity of concept maps, and multiplicity of methods and suitability of guiding theoretical principles on Vee diagrams. The chapter discusses the results and provides implications for teaching mathematics particularly for promoting meaningful learning and effective problem solving in mathematics classrooms."

            "content": "pedagogical decisions teachers make about teaching and assessment are influenced by their mathematical beliefs (Ernest, 1999; Pfannkuch, 2001). Typically, an authoritative perspective views mathematics as a body of knowledge to be taught by transmission and learnt by simply receiving the information. In contrast, cognitive and social perspectives view mathematics learning and understanding \"as the result of interacting and synthesizing one's thoughts with those of others\" (Schell, 2001, p. 2) suggesting mathematics knowledge is a social construction that is validated over time, by a community of mathematicians. Hence making sense is both an individual and consensual social process (Ball, 1993). Ideally, classroom practices should equip students with the appropriate language and skills to enable the construction of the mathematics that is taught, and critical analysis and justification of the constructions in terms of the structure of mathematics (Richards, 1991). Lesh (2000) argues that, \"mathematics is not simply about doing what you are told . . . . . . mathematics is about making sense of patterns, and regularities in complex systems . . . it involves interpreting situations mathematically.\" (p. 193) while Balacheff (1990, p. 2) points out that \"students need to learn mathematics as social knowledge; they are not free to choose the meanings they construct. These meanings must not only be efficient in solving problems, but they must also be coherent with those socially recognized. This condition is necessary for the future participation of students as adults in social activities.\""

Firstly, in Samoa the narrow view most undergraduate students have, reflects their school mathematics experiences, found to be mostly rote learning, a problem consistently raised by national examiners. Even the top 10-percent of Year 13 (equivalent to Year 12 in Australia) students consistently struggle with applications of basic principles to solve inequations/equations and/or graph functions (Afamasaga-Fuata'i, 2005a, 2002; Afamasaga-Fuata'i, Meyer, & Falo, 2007). Secondly, students justify methods in terms of sequential steps instead of the conceptual structure of mathematics. Thirdly, students may be proficient in solving familiar problems, however, the lack of critical analysis and application becomes evident when they are given novel problems (Afamasaga-Fuata'i, 2005b). Such approaches are symptomatic of authoritative classroom practices in which students typically do not question, challenge or influence the teaching of mathematics (Knuth & Peressini, 2001, p. 10). The examination-driven teaching of secondary mathematics in Samoa naturally inculcates a narrow view of mathematics (Afamasaga-Fuata'i, 2005a, 2002). As a result, problem solving skills students acquire over the many years of secondary schooling may not necessarily be situated \"within a wider understanding of overall concepts\" and would probably not be \"long-lasting\" (Barton, 2001)."

Also, the socio-cultural theories view classroom practices as means of reinforcing certain views of what it means to learn and succeed in mathematics. Collectively, learning mathematics involves both individual and social processes. According to Schoenfeld (1991) and Ernest (1999), when an effort is made to change classroom practices into activities that involve: questioning, analyzing, conjecturing, refuting, proving, extending, and generalizing as students solve problems, those rituals and practices can actually shape the behaviour and understanding of students by making it more natural for them to think and reason mathematically. Overall, both the meaningful learning and social constructivist approaches support the meta-cognitive development of students' understanding and the active construction of mathematical thought whilst publicly presenting, for example, maps/diagrams, within a social setting."

Only \\(35\\%\\) of the propositions were valid with only one integrative crosslink, see Table 12.1. The high proportion of invalid propositions was due to missing or inappropriate linking words. At the first group critique, critical comments focused on the need to reconsider the hierarchical order of concepts, missing relevant concepts and inappropriate concept labels. Comments from subsequent critiques over the semester pinpointed areas of confusion, which guided Art to sections of his map that needed re-organization and re-structuring to enhance its intended meaning. By the end of semester, Art's final concept map showed an increase in valid nodes (from 14 to 24) with significantly more valid propositions (from 35 to \\(78\\%\\)), more sub-branches (from 6 to 10), higher average hierarchical levels per sub-branch (from 4 to 6), an additional main branch (from 3 to 4) and an increased number of multiple branching nodes (from 4 to 8) (Table 12.2)."

This was the fundamental role of the Vee diagrams – to elaborate on the concepts shown by the concept maps. With this elaboration, I was able to understand the topic even better.\" That is, possessing only a procedural and algorithmic view of mathematics is limiting. Instead, an enriched knowledge of the conceptual bases of methods, and in-depth knowledge of the conceptual structure can motivate students to learn more about their topic. For example, Lou wrote: \"Making sense out of a difficult topic through concept mapping was the miracle that I was enlightened with. In addition to this awesome discovery, I realised that the miracle was endless. That is, I could go on learning more about least square polynomial approximations because there is always more concepts waiting to be discovered, analysed and revised.

Furthermore, students realized that the communication of their understanding is more effective if concepts are arranged in a hierarchical order complete with appropriate labels, meaningful links with concise and suitable linking words. Another value claim of the study is the potential of applying the meta-cognitive tools to other subject areas by the same students. This is succinctly captured by Lou's comments in her final report: \"I was able to apply the theory of concept mapping to my other subjects and found that I became relaxed when confronted with a difficult topic. Then I was rewarded with good marks. Before I learnt of concept maps, my initial response to a difficult subject would be to panic. Then I would try to break the problem down, read, research, memorize, and do all the things an average student does before understanding some of the topic being studied. Now I wish that our high school teachers had taught us about concept mapping. It would have done wonders for me.\""

As one of the students noted, collecting a list of relevant concepts and formulas is one thing but actually figuring out how they should all be interconnected is another. That is, the task of determining the most appropriate linking words to concisely describe the nature of the interconnection still requires further improvement. From this study, the 6 students appreciated the utility of the maps/diagrams as means of illustrating conceptual interconnections within a topic and highlighting connection between principles and procedural steps. Students also appreciated the value of the tools in mapping their growing understanding and as means of communicating that understanding to others in a social setting. Findings from this cohort suggest that concept maps and Vee diagrams are potentially viable tools for developing a deeper understanding of the structure of mathematics and facilitative tools to guide and regulate mathematical discussions and dialogues in mathematics classrooms. Using these tools as part of normal classroom routine and practices is an area worthy of further research."

The focus is on a particular process of teaching. When the expert in mathematics analyses in detail the material of his assignment, he is able to realise that within the structure of knowledge itself, a group of concept maps are found in an implicit way. The maps made by the professor are of great importance when he uses them as a guide for his performance in the classroom. When the teacher utilises in the classroom a guided way of performing with the maps, he implements a didactic strategy and he helps students to develop skills of thought to achieve meaningful learning. This way of performing allows the development of the processes of basic thinking in mathematics; it facilitates the understanding of concepts and the application of them within the process of solving problems."

The authors point out that together the cognitive and the socio-cultural paradigms can complement each other to give meaning to what is learnt. This complementary model finds support in the affirmation by Vygotsky (1979), namely, the potential of learning (i.e., the cognitive dimension) is developed by means of contextualized socialization (i.e., the cultural dimension)."

The authors, from this perspective, emphasize that one can and should complement both paradigms. While the cognitive paradigm is more individualistic, the socio-cultural paradigm is more socializing. The first centers around the individual, the thought processes both of the teacher and of the student, and the second centers around the context-group-individual interaction and vice versa. Following these ideas, learning mathematics may be understood as a development of capacities (i.e., cognitive elements the student develops while relating with the mathematical content during the learning process) as well as attitudes (i.e., affective elements developed in the context of the classroom as a product of the interactions with the teacher and companions)."

For example, a group of particular elements conform generalities that can be called \"low level generalities\". At the same time, a group of \"low level generalities\" form \"mid level generalities\". Finally a group of \"mid level generalities\" form \"high level generalities\". Depending upon the characteristics of the contents themselves there can be few or many generalities. The conformation or grouping of information represents a structure that is implicit in the knowledge of mathematics. This structure or network can be noted when the mathematical content is analyzed or weighed up. But also, these structures represent concept maps. Novak (1998) points out that concept maps represent knowledge. That knowledge can be concepts and can be propositions as well, depending on the context. Concept maps, as a representation of knowledge, serve as support for teaching and learning."

For the authors this learning is considered a Cyclical Process of Scientific Learning, (see Fig. 13.3). They recommend that teaching professionals must be respectful of this cyclical learning process, since in this way the students will make sense of what they are learning.

As to the relation induction-deduction, the author says it is not right to drop the inductive elements too soon in the cognitive activity of the student in the classroom. On the one hand, it is not correct to assimilate in a reduced way the scientific method, in other words, only employ the deductive part, or only use the hypothetical-deductive method. The lack of inductive processes (the abuse of deductive processes) limits the options of personal research important for the development of thought. That does not mean that as the student reaches formal levels he leaves aside the deductive processes. On the way to high levels of abstraction the student must count, in his personal experience, on a certain prior training in inductive processes. This"

From the perception of this information (i.e., starting from the particular), the teacher in charge will guide the students, without forgetting the processes of representation (i.e., imagination) and with visual support (De Guzmán, 1996), towards conceptualization (i.e., construction of concepts; understanding of ideas; arriving at the general).

An inductive process is not employed first so that later the student can be taken through a deductive process. Generally, perhaps more often at the university, a formal conceptual system is introduced by means of symbols that include principles, definitions, theorems, and laws; that is to say, they introduce theory. This is more notable in what is known as master classes, commonly found in university lecture halls (De Miguel Díaz et al., 2006). Since the student is not in a condition to assimilate such a system, audiovisual methods are used so they understand. From a theoretical framework, they wish to pass to representation. Afterwards, when they realize the student is not able to apply the concepts, even with the help of audiovisual methods, they teach him the applications in reality. So finally they reach the reality (the particular) where they should have started. Thus in classical and present day teaching, the order of learning activities is not respected. Learning of quality implies teaching that procures a balance between the thought processes that conform abstraction."

If it is a question of non-extreme values he can classify them in points with a vertical tangent line or a horizontal tangent line. As a particular interpretation of Piaget's ideas, contrasting facts with concepts and concepts with facts is considered as leading to inductive and deductive processes thus contributing to constructive learning (Piaget, 1979).

The question of real numbers is important for the study of calculus. The concept map the student can create on this topic, after hearing the presentation and explanations of the teacher, in addition to setting in motion thought processes, represents an image that can be stored easily by the student to which he can return when necessary during his studies for the solution of problems."

This procedure in the lecture room forces a deductive process without any previous inductive process and motivates memorization rather than the comprehension of the ideas. The concept map in Fig. 13.8 presents two concrete cases of displacement, a horizontal displacement and a vertical one of a particular function. These two cases, can be presented first by the teacher, contain appropriate images that allow the comprehension of the effect of the constants \\( b \\) and \\( c \\) on a function. Various concept maps can be constructed to foster thought processes during the explanation of the displacements such as the lengthening, the compressions and reflections of functions, leading finally to link all this information with the expression \\( g(x) = kf(ax - b) + c \\). As has been said before, at later stages of the explanations, the students, with the advice of the teacher, can elaborate their own maps. The proper construction of these maps represents satisfactory learning in the subjects of calculus."

Two groups were formed: the control group and the experimental group, each one with 20 students. The control group began an ordinary Calculus course and the experimental group began the same course but with the Program of Intervention. During this investigation both quantitative and qualitative instruments were used in order to carry out an evaluation of the teaching process with teaching guided by concept maps. The instruments employed to carry out the qualitative register were; a diary of each of the students, a diary by the teacher and the partial evaluations of the content carried out during the course. The information offered by the students in these evaluations reflected qualitative aspects of academic benefits understood as the level of learning obtained by the students from the contents of the subject and about the development of capacities and skills. To carry out the quantitative register the following instruments were used: Test of differential aptitudes DAT-5 (Differential Aptitude Test, Fifth Edition. Authors: George K. Bennett, Harold G. Seashore and Alexander G. Wesman) measuring Numerical Reasoning, Abstract Reasoning and Spatial Relationships."

Also the students commented that the images and graphic representations for particular information is an effective aid to the comprehension of more complex concepts.

The processing of information from DAT-5 measuring Abstract Reasoning and Spatial Relationships revealed, in addition, statistically significant differences in the experimental group with a confidence level of \\(99\\%\\) between before and after. Consequently, it is obvious there is a significant evolution of Numerical Reasoning, Abstract Reasoning and Spatial Relationships in the experimental group. This increase can be explained principally from the effect of integrating into the teaching-learning process for a Calculus course, of concept maps as tools for the development of cognitive skills and capacities in the students. It is important to emphasize the theoretical ideas supporting the concept maps, mainly those implicit in the way of employing them, which can plausibly explain the changes experienced by the students."

In general terms, deep focus depends upon the student centering his attention on the content of the learning material and is orientated toward the message this contains, toward the meaning. Superficial focus is characterized by the fact that the student directs his attention to the text itself, toward the sign, which indicates a reproductive conception of learning. What is important in deep focus is the comprehension and in superficial, memorization."

Polya (1981) asserts it would be a mistake to consider the solution to a problem is a purely intellectual matter; determination and emotions play an important part. Auto-concept is a basic factor in learning, which can be modified or developed in the classroom with repercussions in better learning.

Concept mapping and Vee diagramming made Nat realized that there was a need to deeply reflect on what he really knows, determine how to use what he knows, identify when to use which knowledge, and be able to justify why using valid mathematical arguments. Simply knowing formal definitions and mathematical principles verbatim did not necessarily guarantee an in-depth understanding of the complexity of inter-connections between mathematical concepts and procedures. The presentations of his ideas and understanding of differential equations, Nat found, was greatly facilitated by using his individually constructed concept maps and Vee diagrams. The external projection of his ideas visually on maps/diagrams also facilitated social critiques and mathematical communication during seminar presentations and one-on-one consultations with the researcher. The chapter discusses some implications for teaching mathematics."

For example, two nodes: \"Graphs\" and \"Parabolas\" may be interconnected and described with linking words: \"may be\" on the link, to form the proposition \"Graphs\" may be \"Parabolas.\" A Vee diagram on the other hand is a Vee with its tip situated in the problem to be solved with its two sides representing the conceptual information (i.e. theory, principles and concepts) on the left and the methodological information (given information, transformations and knowledge claims) on the right. An active interplay between the two sides ensures cohesiveness of the displayed information to generate a summative overview of the theoretical principles and concepts informing and guiding the methods of transforming the given information to answer some focus questions (Novak & Gowin, 1984). Examples of concept maps and Vee diagrams are provided later."

Different cohorts, over a decade, chose mathematics topics that varied in the recency of their formal study of it. \"Formal study\" is defined as the study of the topic as part of a traditional semester-long, undergraduate mathematics course while \"recency\" is characterised three ways, namely, recent past, concurrent, or new. \"Recent past\" refers to formal study in the previous one or two semesters before the research while \"concurrent\" means the student is formally studying the topic in a separate course whilst also participating in the research. \"New\" topic means students have not yet formally studied it in a semester-long mathematics course."

In particular, its principles of assimilation and integration of new and old knowledge into existing knowledge structures assisted in making sense of the processes of meaningful learning. It is argued that when learning new knowledge, students may begin by trying to decide which established ideas within their cognitive structures (or patterns of meanings) are most relevant to it. The deliberate linking of concepts to relevant existing concepts may take place by progressive differentiation and/or integrative reconciliation (Ausubel, Hanesian, & Novak, 1998; Ausubel, 2000). To illustrate these processes, one of Nat's concept maps is used. Figure 14.1 shows a partial view (left vertical segment) of Nat's first concept map in which the concept “\\(a_0 dy/dx + a_1 y = Q(x)\\)” is progressively differentiated into two links to connect to concepts “\\(Q(x) = 0\\)” and “\\(Q(x) \\neq 0\\).” In"

Knowledge about knowledge or meta-knowledge learning is viewed \"as a form of meta-cognition, where learners acquire an understanding of the nature of concepts and concept formation and the processes of knowledge creation\" (Novak, 1985). That people remember better, longer, and in more detail if they understand, actively organize what they are learning, connect new knowledge to prior knowledge, and elaborate is also supported by Bransford, Brown, and Cocking (2000). Students will remember procedures better, longer, and in more detail if they actively make sense of procedures, connect procedures to other procedures, and connect procedures to concepts and representations. These perspectives collectively recommend that the best way to remember is to understand, elaborate, and organize what you know thus providing support for the principles of meaningful learning and"

Hence, through public presentations, students necessarily seek to negotiate meaning, justify and argue the validity of their work. For the social interactions and negotiations to be mathematically relevant, the substance of the communication needs to be focused on important mathematical ideas. Engaging students in evidence-based arguments as part of classroom communication, by focusing on explanations, arguments, and justifications, builds conceptual understanding. Communication should include multiple modes (talking, listening, writing, drawing, etc.) because making connections among multiple ways of representing mathematical concepts is central to developing conceptual understanding (Moschkovitch, 2004). This chapter suggests an innovative, alternative mode of communication, namely, concept mapping and Vee diagramming in a mathematics classroom."

Nat's concept maps are assessed mainly in terms of the complexity of the network structure (structure) of concepts, nature of the contents (contents) within concept boxes and valid propositions (propositions). The structure criteria indicate the depth of differentiation and extent of integration between concepts, whilst the contents criteria reflect the nature of Nat's perceptions of what constitutes mathematical knowledge.

Some of the changes (compare Figs. 14.3 and 14.4) were deletions of nodes (e.g. independent variable, dependent variable), and merging of two branches (second order linear differential equation, nth order linear differential equation) to give a more enriched, differentiated and integrated concept hierarchy as partially shown in Fig. 14.4."

For example, Nat wrote: “Due to questions raised in class, on what ‘auxiliary equations’ represented and how it’s formed. Therefore, more details were presented …” and “the whole concept of reduction of order needed clarification in all senses due to its shortened presentation before.” When there was no criticism, he tended to leave the maps/diagrams unchanged. For example, he said: “I encountered very little or no critical comment during class presentations … (so) … I’m left with no urge to make any further modifications … not criticized at all, therefore no changes.” That is, his determination to minimize critical comments from others motivated Nat to continually develop a more complete and comprehensive map, which accommodated critical comments of the previous critique to ensure minimal criticism in the next critique. For example, he added branches to clarify the concepts: auxiliary equation, reduction of order in his second map, and added a new branch in the final map to accommodate power series solutions (see Fig. 14.4)."

His fluency with the language of D.E. and the communication of this mathematical understanding publicly was made more effective and efficient with maps/diagrams involving important mathematical ideas. Substantive mathematical communication and multiple communication modes to support the development of conceptual understanding in mathematics, as emphasized by Moschkovitch (2004) for bilingual learners, were evident in Nat's case study. Further, noticeable growth in Nat's in-depth understanding of D.E. was indicated by the increased number of valid propositions and structural complexity of conceptual networks in his final map, and improved correspondence between listed principles and solutions on Vee diagrams. However, because of his tendency to view interconnections and principles with a procedural bias, Nat needs to continuously revise his maps/diagrams with appropriate critiques and feedback from other mathematics people to ensure that the conceptual interconnections are made more explicit on links on concept maps and the principles of Vee diagrams are more theoretically stated and less procedural."

By constructing maps/diagrams, students can be challenged to represent and organize their mathematics knowledge and to demonstrate their understanding of the structure of the mathematics embedded in a problem or relevant to a topic. Socially interacting and negotiating meanings with others has the potential to influence one's thinking and reasoning such that it may result in consolidating one's understanding or signaling the need for further reflection and revisions. Such a process of reorganization, revision and reflection is necessarily cyclic and interactive, which can ultimately result in the development of one's conceptual understanding and meaningful learning of mathematics. Further research is recommended to investigate these ideas further in mathematical classrooms at all levels."

Students were required to construct comprehensive topic maps/diagrams as ongoing exercises throughout the semester and to present these for critique before individuals finalized them. With improved mapping proficiency and on-going social critiques, students' mathematical understanding deepened, becoming more conceptual as a result of continually revising their work as the validity of each map is dependent on how effective it illustrated the intended meanings and correct mathematics structure. Students also developed an appreciation of the crucial inter-linkages between mathematical principles, common procedures and formulas, and how all of these mutually reinforce each other conceptually and methodologically. Incorporating concept mapping as a normal mathematical practice in classrooms can potentially alter the learning of mathematics, making it more meaningful and conceptual to supplement the predominantly procedural proficiency practised in many mathematics classrooms."

Instead, answers are often in terms of methodological issues or sequential relations rather than a conceptual framework, which indicate that a student's proficiency and adeptness in executing a procedure may not necessarily reflect deep, conceptual understanding of the mathematics involved. To challenge the depth of student understanding in any domain, they may be asked to effectively represent and communicate that understanding for public scrutiny."

In Samoa, the fragmented, and narrow view of mathematics most undergraduate students have, reflect their secondary mathematics experiences. While most students are proficient in applying formulas to familiar problems (i.e., routine expertise (Hatano, 2003)), there is a remarkable lack of critical thinking and analysis especially evident when they are given novel problems to solve. More particularly, students may have the knowledge of relevant content areas and procedures but are often unable to, independently and flexibly, apply what they know to problems unless substantial guidance is provided (Afamasaga-Fuata'i, 2005a, 2002; Afamasaga-Fuata'i, Meyer, Falo, & Sufia, 2007). Such manifestations (a) characterize students who learn mathematics by memorising collections of facts and procedures with little effort in making connections between topics, and (b) typically reflect prevailing socio-cultural practices of their school mathematics classrooms. According to Hiebert and Carpenter (1992), understanding takes place when students develop relationships and connections in their mathematical knowledge whereas adaptive expertise (Hatano, 2003), in contrast to routine expertise, is meaningful (deep conceptual and procedural) knowledge that can be applied creatively, flexibly, and appropriately to new, as well as familiar tasks."

If and when explanations are given, they are \"reflective of precedent-driven comprehension with no logical basis for a priori reasoning\" (Baroody, Feil, & Johnson, 2007), indicative of previous socio-mathematical practices in classrooms where mathematical dialogues and discussion of mathematical ideas are neither supported nor encouraged (Richards, 1991). Further exacerbating this problem is the examination-driven teaching of secondary school mathematics, which naturally inculcates a narrow view of mathematics. Against this general background, a series of concept mapping and Vee diagrams studies (mapping studies) with different cohorts of undergraduate students was initiated (Afamasaga-Fuata'i, 2005b, 2002, 2001) primarily to explore different ways in which mathematics learning could be made more meaningful and more conceptual. Therefore, the research questions for this chapter are: (1) How can hierarchical concept maps illustrate improvements in students' understanding of mathematics topics? (2) In what ways do social interactions influence students' developing understanding?"

The assimilation of new knowledge into students' existing patterns of meanings takes place through the process of progressive differentiation and/or integrative reconciliation where new meanings are acquired by the interaction of new, potentially meaningful ideas with what is previously learnt. This interactional process results in a modification of both the potential meaning of new information and the meaning of the knowledge structure to which it becomes connected to (Ausubel, 2000)."

The emphasis here is that the learner reaches \"cognitive maturation\" (Vygotsky, 1978) in his/her cognitive development. Social interactions or external stimuli are consequential to a learner only to the degree that he/she can assimilate them by means of his/her cognitive structures (Piaget, 1969). Hence, while social interactions and negotiations are influential to a student's thinking and reasoning that he/she has reached cognitive maturation (i.e., at the peak of his/her zone of proximal development) would be manifested by what he/she does with directed thought. The latter is internal and occurs without communication with another as social thought that is increasingly influenced by experience and logic and no longer tied to an immediate social context. Consequently, higher mental processes engage the \"social\" interactions of inner speech to create new knowledge (Marsh & Ketterer, 2005). Furthermore, Vygotsky proposed that human beings achieve control over natural mental functions by bringing socio-culturally formed mediating artifacts into thinking activity while cultural artifacts, situated within a human activity system, mediate human activity (Marsh & Ketterer, 2005). Again the emphasis falls on learners actively constructing knowledge and meaning through participating in activities and challenges, with the added emphasis on the interaction between learners and facilitators in order to arrive at a higher level of truth (Sternberg & Williams, 1998). In problem solving, having information about which to think, analytically, creatively, or practically is as important as the thinking process itself. In other words, thinking"

The newly established socio-mathematical norms required students to conduct conceptual analyses of a topic and its problems and to display the results using maps/diagrams in order to publicly communicate their understanding for critique in a social setting, comprising their peers and the researcher, during individual presentations to the group and one-on-one consultations with the researcher."

Students met twice a week for 50 minutes each time over 14 weeks. Maps/diagrams were introduced as means of learning mathematics more meaningfully and solving problems more effectively. The content included the topics: limits and continuity, indeterminate forms, numerical methods, differentiation, integration, motion, multiple integrals, infinite series, normal distributions and complex analysis. The epistemological principles, namely, building upon students' prior knowledge, negotiation of meanings, consensus and provision of time-in-class for student reflections, guided classroom practices. Hence, the study included a familiarization phase, which introduced the new socio-mathematical norms of students presenting and justifying their work publicly, addressing critical comments, and then later on critiquing peers' presented work. Time was set aside between critiques to revise maps/diagrams. The cyclic process of: presenting (to peers or researcher) \\(\\rightarrow\\) critiquing \\(\\rightarrow\\) revising \\(\\rightarrow\\) presenting underpinned the study. Of the 13 students, 3 chose topics outside of mathematics (computer programming, cell biology, and organic chemistry). This paper reports the data from the mathematics maps only."

By searching for missing relevant concepts to make the maps more robust and comprehensive, students eventually realized that an in-depth understanding of topics required much more than re-stating a definition or formula. Instead, concept mapping invited the students to identify more inclusive and less inclusive concepts of their topics, demonstrate an integrated understanding of concepts, definitions and formulas, and visually organise this understanding as a meaningful hierarchy of interconnecting nodes with rich linking words to form valid propositions for public scrutiny and critique. In so doing, concept mapping provided one means of reinforcing a \"view (of) mathematical knowledge as cohesive or structured rather than a series of isolated\" (Baroody et al., 2007) definitions, formulas and procedures and as knowledge that is socially warranted by a community of mathematicians."

Furthermore, students experienced difficulties reconciling the type of linear learning style they are used to (e.g., by memorizing definitions) to the hierarchical nature and organization required for concept mapping. The progressive quality of students' maps over the semester confirmed that students' deepening understanding of their topics were very much influenced by the scaffolding and social interactions during critiques, the newly established socio-mathematical norms of the classroom setting, and the socially-validated structure of mathematics. That is, the deliberate alteration of the classroom environment and practices particularly in terms of the individual/social orientation of the learning, and the form and extent of the focus of assessment (Pratt & Kelly, 2005) resulted in a more conceptual and theoretical understanding of their topics. Findings also extended the literature on the impact of social negotiations of meanings, interactions and critiques on the development of students' conceptual understanding of topics, which in this study, was greatly facilitated with the visual mapping of students' progressive conceptions on hierarchical maps over time. Finally, using the meta-cognitive tools promoted a higher level of self-reflection and lateral thinking which, generally motivated students to critically analyse their perceptions of mathematics knowledge and, specifically encouraged deeper, conceptual understandings of topics."

Whilst various authors from different parts of the world, investigated and presented the work of one, a few, or many teachers/students, subsequent findings nonetheless suggest potentially viable approaches that could be usefully adopted and adapted in mathematics classrooms anywhere in the world to address the recurring problems experienced by many students as they struggle to make sense of mathematics problems, concepts and processes. These findings have implications for learners of mathematics both in schools and various university programs."

Most important were the visual displays of networks of propositions on concept maps and theoretical and procedural entries on vee diagrams, which effectively encapsulated the interconnections between the curriculum's Knowledge and Skills and Working Mathematically Syllabus Outcomes. The student's reflections provided further evidence of the value of the meta-cognitive strategies in enabling her to become more pedagogically aware of developmental trends and interconnections most relevant to make mathematics learning and problem solving more meaningful and conceptual for her future students. Examining the impact of this kind of preparatory work on teaching practice and students' meaningful learning of mathematics is worthy of further investigation."

The student's concept map addressed both a serious deficiency in current elementary mathematics programs in the United States and provides a reliable direction for future mathematics curriculum development.

Through a series of progressive concept maps, the post-graduate student demonstrated his evolving conceptual and hence pedagogical understanding of the development of the fraction concept across the primary level. The conceptual labels, and propositional links apparent in the final overview map were substantively more enriched than the initial maps whilst through the construction of vee diagrams, the student engaged in the processes of critical analysis and synthesis, thinking and reasoning, justifying and explaining his knowledge and understanding to highlight the interconnections between mathematics principles, concepts and procedures. The findings imply that the routine construction of concept maps and vee diagrams and regularly expecting students to provide justifications for their mapped interrelationships and methods of solutions can promote the careful development of solutions that make sense and can therefore be justified and rationalized (cf. Ellis, 2007, p. 196), and inevitably over a long period of time, could lead to learning mathematics that is more meaningful and more conceptual in regular mathematics classrooms. Such an undertaking and anticipated outcome requires further research."

Student maps provided snapshots of their understanding of a topic at a particular time. Assessing the displayed interconnections revealed the extent to which meaningful learning took place, leading to further reflection and discourse between student and teacher and/or amongst students. The teachers indicated that they would continue with concept mapping as a strategy to brainstorm ideas about new topics and as an assessment tool after a unit. Peer tutoring was highly recommended as a means of working collaboratively with new students or new schools. These suggestions provide viable directions for further research with more schools in anticipation of a broader impact of concept mapping on student learning and assessment."

Findings revealed concept mapping as a useful tool to enable the design of an innovative and conceptually more transparent instructional module on proportionality and also to check the pupils' prior knowledge and monitor their learning process.

One student demonstrated that she had internalized the concept in its systemic interconnections while the other continued to see it through formalistic lens. Findings suggest the need for teachers to not only examine the conceptual connections of superordinate concepts as revealed in curriculum documents and textbooks but that they should also analyse the concepts' historical conceptual development to fully grasp the nature of mathematics as a conceptual system.

The progressive quality of students' maps over the semester confirmed that students' deepening understanding of their topics were very much influenced by the scaffolding and social interactions during critiques, the newly established socio-mathematical norms of the classroom setting, and the socially-validated structure of mathematics.
